1
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,726
Why didn't you call me?

2
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,227
Have you been waiting long?

3
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,630
- No.
- Let's go in.

4
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,010
Exactly in a month from now,

5
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:48,867
your rent and half of
the utilities are due.

6
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,401
If you can't pay that, you must move out.

7
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,794
I can't accept your belongings instead.

8
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,701
Also, we'll buy our own food, okay?

9
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,701
- Okay.
- All right, then.

10
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,887
I'll sleep here. You can sleep there.

11
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,789
I'll sleep on the couch.

12
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,393
Sure, that's fine.

13
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:08,568
Now, here's some important stuff.

14
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,565
Make sure all windows are open
before you use the vacuum cleaner.

15
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:16,069
And separate the recyclables carefully.
This is very important.

16
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,174
The top two shelves are mine.
The bottom one is yours.

17
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,577
If you must use my shelf,
don't forget to label your container.

18
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:25,979
And...

19
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,383
What? What is it?

20
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,468
Nothing. You're just a bit different
from what people say about you.

21
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,354
In what sense?

22
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,557
You're a worse nagger
than my housekeeper is.

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,468
You'll also have to watch your mouth.

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,268
Give me that. Because my
place isn't that spacious,

25
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,302
you should lay it out like this.

26
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,001
Then fold it like this.

27
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,375
After that, all you have to do is this.

28
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,868
You saw what I did, right?

29
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,279
What else?

30
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:08,368
Don't you think that guy,
Woo Young, likes Mi Rae?

31
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,156
What?

32
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,526
Now that she's pretty,
guys swarm around her.

33
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,829
What? Who? That jerk?

34
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,832
Why are you calling him a jerk?

35
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,334
He's in Mi Rae's department.
I heard he's a TA.

36
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,337
Whatever he is, it doesn't matter.
All men are animals.

37
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,440
If he's a TA, he should
focus on guiding students.

38
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,341
How dare he have a crush on Mi Rae?
What a jerk.

39
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,645
He's someone's beloved child too.
Why do you keep talking ill of him?

40
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:34,347
I'd love to have a son-in-law like him.

41
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,616
A son-in-law? Did you say "son-in-law"?

42
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,735
Mi Rae is too young to get married.

43
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,535
She's still a kid!

44
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,124
Okay, I heard you. Just drive carefully.

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
Goodness.

46
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,563
Where does he live?

47
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,767
Is it close to Mi Rae's place?

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,367
Oh, dear.

49
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,467
Who is it?

50
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,235
Hey, Mi Rae.

51
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,868
My mom wanted me to give you this.

52
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,433
- Your mom?
- Yes.

53
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,792
Take the containers.
Come in for a few minutes.

54
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,683
Make sure you tell your mom
that I thanked her.

55
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,034
Okay.

56
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,461
You should put everything in the
fridge as soon as possible.

57
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:32,857
Oh, right.

58
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,001
Let's see.

59
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:43,420
Hey, what are you doing here?

60
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,001
I live here now.

61
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,089
What?

62
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,967
I posted about looking for a roommate,

63
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,868
and he showed up.
He practically begged me.

64
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,090
Right, you're at the age where you
must be dying to live on your own.

65
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,650
When you saw a cool guy like me doing it,

66
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,867
you must've wanted to move out too.
Aren't I right?

67
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,735
My, these side dishes look amazing.

68
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:18,269
Kyung Seok moved out
of his parents' place?

69
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,654
Yes, I was so surprised too.

70
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,956
I was definitely not
expecting to see him there.

71
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,457
There must've been a reason.

72
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,468
I wonder if the talk
Ms. Na had with him went well.

73
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,866
It bothers me that he moved
out right after that.

74
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,401
Are you worried?

75
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,970
A little, I guess.

76
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,873
About yourself or him?

77
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,374
About me? Why?

78
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,892
Now that he lives so close by,

79
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,078
you might fall for him.
Are you worried about that?

80
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,401
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,283
I think...

82
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,152
that something big will happen
between you two in the near future.

83
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,653
Are you writing a novel or what?

84
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,355
What? It's possible.

85
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,957
Kyung Seok's nice to you.

86
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,692
Stop writing stories.

87
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,861
You should've majored in
literature, not psychology.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,862
What?

89
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,964
Eat up. This is really delicious.

90
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:07,500
I cooked for you today to
congratulate your move.

91
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,769
But starting tomorrow,
you should cook your own meals.

92
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:10,604
Okay.

93
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:12,092
Let's eat.

94
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:19,512
Mi Rae's mother is a great cook.
This is really delicious.

95
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,681
How do you know her parents?

96
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,000
I ran into them a couple of times.

97
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,086
How many times did you run into them?

98
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,687
What?

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,392
What are you going to eat
for breakfast tomorrow?

100
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,227
I rarely eat breakfast.

101
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,832
Have you ever worked?

102
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,734
No.

103
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,004
That means you'll have to turn into
an adult starting from tomorrow.

104
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,806
Reality strikes once you move out of
your parents' place.

105
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:02,867
Turn left.

106
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,459
You've gone off-course.
You'll be redirected.

107
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,469
(Do Kyung Seok)

108
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,770
I'm sorry. Today's my first day,
so I'm kind of lost.

109
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,806
No, it's okay. I'm not bothered by you.

110
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,708
Just focus on driving safely.

111
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,010
Okay. Thank you.

112
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,501
I wonder if Ms. Na
called because she knew.

113
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,834
You startled me.

114
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,440
Sorry.

115
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,909
Are you in charge of recycling?

116
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,767
Yes.

117
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,499
Can you wait a little?

118
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,401
I'm not done with my garbage.

119
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,802
Okay.

120
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,367
Who throws away cans like that?

121
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,167
Are you okay?

122
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,871
Yes.

123
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,873
I'm fine.

124
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,379
Are you hurt? Come over here.

125
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,181
No, it's okay.

126
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,583
Let me see.

127
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,587
I'm really okay.

128
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:28,501
I'll see you.

129
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,307
See you again.

130
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,268
"See you again"?

131
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:39,235
Do I need to see him every day now?

132
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,320
- Goodnight.
- You're sleeping already?

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,122
I need to leave early in the morning.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,625
You should sleep too.
You'll have to face reality tomorrow.

135
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,302
I shouldn't have taken the cab.

136
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,024
Are you okay?

137
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:05,565
Let me see.

138
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,967
I'm really okay.

139
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:41,286
Hey.

140
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:44,170
The hot water won't turn on.

141
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,371
Hot water?

142
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:49,576
I haven't used it yet, but
I'm sure there's a button.

143
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,479
But you're a man. I'm surprised
you shower with hot water in summer.

144
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,110
Gosh, I'm about to faint.

145
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,409
He can't be human.

146
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,796
- Why is he so handsome?
- Go talk to him.

147
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,898
No, you should go up to him and say hello.

148
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,533
No.

149
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:48,935
My gosh.

150
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,543
Welcome.

Kyung Seok.

157
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:13,853
What are you doing here?

158
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,557
I was waiting for you guys.

159
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,962
He waited...

160
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,365
...for me?

161
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,443
How did you know we'd come?

162
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,043
I never saw you pass by.

163

00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:03,269
Why did you move into Woo Young's place?

167
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,492
I thought you moved out of your
dad's place to live by yourself.

168
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:08,277
It's cheap there. I don't
have money right now.

169
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:11,277
Didn't your dad offer to pay for you?

170
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,516
Did you run away from home?

171
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,118
Why would I run away from home?
I'm not a high school kid.

172
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,319
Does your mother know about this?

173
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:24,924
I didn't tell her yet.

174
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,095
Our bus is here.

175
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,310
(Adult, Card: 1.2 dollars,
Cash: 1.3 dollars)

176
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,006
Aren't you going to get on?

177
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,075
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,778
You can go first.

179
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,682
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,410
Is he mad at us?

181
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:08,427
So why did you have to ask
details about his private life?

182
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,077
We're friends. You can
ask a friend that much.

183
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:13,643
You asked him whether
Ms. Na knew about it too.

184
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:17,569
Anyway, it doesn't look like he
moved out for a good reason, right?

185
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,076
Right.

186
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,009
You face reality once you move out
from your parents' house.

187
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,652
Why does he want the study guide from me?

188
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:49,275
- Who?
- Jang Won Ho.

189
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,810
Gosh, why is he talking so
nicely all of a sudden?

190
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,750
Ji Hyo, do you have a study
guide for the finals?

191
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,943
Would you share it with me?

192
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,956
I guess he's trying to hit on me now
because it doesn't work on you.

193
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,743
I've got you a new cup of coffee.

194
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:15,134
- You're here.
- Here you go.

195
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:16,469
Sung Woon.

196
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:18,671
Check this out.

197
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:20,940
Here.

198
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,042
(Hyun Soo A)

199
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,377
Here.

200
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,964
It's the picture that I took, right?

201
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,359
She changed her profile to this picture.

202
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:34,053
How do you notice even her
newly updated profile picture?

203
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,658
That's impressive.

204
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,176
Didn't you say you'd get flicked
10 times in the forehead...

205
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,231
...if she changed her
profile to this picture?

206
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:51,103
I mean, she shouldn't be giving
you empty hope like this.

207
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,643
This isn't right.

208
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,006
Okay, get ready.

209
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,809
Come on. You're in a good mood today,

210
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,111
- so let it slide this one time.
- Okay.

211
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,450
- One.
- Bring it on.

212
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,753
- Two.
- You're good at it.

213
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:09,255
Right?

214
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,057
Three.

215
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,159
Awesome.

216
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,428
Sung Woon?

217
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,064
Sung Woon.

218
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,935
Hi, Soo A.

219
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:24,570
Hello.

220
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,639
Can I come over to your house one day?

221
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:30,876
Well, it's pretty late when I go
home after my part-time work.

222
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,676
Is that right? How about weekends then?

223
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,282
I should go to my parents'
house on weekends.

224
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,883
You mean, Dogok-dong?

225
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,271
Right.

226
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:41,287
Do you live with your grandparents?

227
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:43,990
When you live with a
lot of family members,

228
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,576
you happen to dream of living alone.
That's why I'm asking.

229
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,577
My grandparents passed away.

230
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,776
I'll take care of it myself.

231
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:18,024
You've become very curious about me.

232
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,228
Well, yes. You can tell me if
you're struggling with anything.

233
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,230
I could help you with it.

234
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:26,332
Okay.

235
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,535
My class is starting soon. I have to go.
See you later.

236
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:30,403
Bye.

237
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:41,225
Should I eat spicy stir-fried
pork or omelet rice?

238
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,776
I'll have pork cutlet.

239
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:44,958
Should I eat spicy stir-fried
pork or omelet rice?

240
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,652
I said I'll have pork cutlet.

241
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,258
- I had it yesterday though.
- Pork cutlet.

242
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:49,976
- Let's go.
- All right.

243
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,906
- Hello?
- Have you had lunch?

244
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,405
No.

245
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,674
Come to the faculty cafeteria.

246
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,577
Never mind if you don't want a free meal.

247
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:04,188
We were having naengmyeon,

248
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:06,699
and he gave me his egg.

249
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,300
You know, this happens
when you eat naengmyeon.

250
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,303
Its toppings matter because it's
too bland to eat just the noodles.

251
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,405
Among all the toppings,

252
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,876
the half-cut egg is so precious that
you wouldn't share it with others.

253
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,910
You know what's surprising?

254
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:20,913
He gave me the pear too.

255
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,866
He knows very well about
how to move your heart.

256
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,070
After all, he meant it when he said
I didn't need to lose weight...

257
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,256
...and that I was cute just the way I was.

258
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,392
Did you guys kiss each other?

259
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,096
Did you hold hands?

260
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:40,166
He's conservative, so he isn't
good at that kind of stuff.

261
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,400
Hey.

262
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,771
Even conservative men become
open-minded to their girlfriends.

263
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,273
What are you talking about?

264
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,375
Be quiet. Others might hear you.

265
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,677
Jung Yeob.

266
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,779
Oh, hey.

267
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,477
Let's eat together here.

268
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,552
Ye Na is here, so people won't suspect us.

269
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,090
I'm good at keeping secrets,
so you don't need to worry.

270
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:06,877
I'm not worried.

271
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:10,196
- Enjoy your food, then.
- Won't you eat with us?

272
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,210
I'll eat with those guys.

273
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,600
I'll call you later.

274
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,607
Ye Na.

275
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,486
By the way, why do you keep
your relationship from others?

276
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,281
It's no good to make it public.

277
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,290
We'll only be gossiped about.

278
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:39,892
Did your boyfriend say that?

279
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,963
Well, I think the same.

280
00:22:51,493 --> 00:22:53,643
Why aren't there any campus couples
in our department?

281
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,442
Maybe it's just that we don't know.

282
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,445
Hi.

283
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,347
- Hello.
- Hello.

284
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,726
- Are you going to have lunch?
- Yes.

285
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,425
I see. Enjoy your lunch.

286
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:07,419
- Okay.
- Thanks.

287
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,329
You can call me when you
want to grab a drink.

288
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,433
I'm a huge fan of yours.

289
00:23:45,242 --> 00:23:46,826
You happen to be hungrier
when you have no money.

290
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,510
You crave a lot of food too.

291
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:51,559
- Did you get a part-time work?
- Not yet.

292
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:54,244
You might get it quickly if you post
a writing on a job-hunting website.

293
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:58,250
Or you should look for a job
about private tutoring...

294
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,139
...or teaching at institutions because
they pay you more than minimum wage.

295
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,060
It's easy for students in our
college to get such part-time jobs.

296
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:06,712
If not, look for a modeling
job at shopping websites.

297
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,414
They pay you more than
10 dollars per hour.

298
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,116
Make sure your workplace is close
to your house and school...

299
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,018
...in order to save transportation fees.

300
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,120
And...

301
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,122
...if they often hire new part-timers,
the work must be tough there.

302
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,225
It means their part-timers often run away.

303
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:20,843
And what else?

304
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,429
Ask me if something's strange.

305
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,344
I know a lot because I've done
all kinds of part-time jobs.

306
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,736
I have to go prepare for
my next class. Bye.

307
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,643
Take your time and eat slowly.

308
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:46,743
Do you live with Woo Young?

309
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,577
I've heard you two talk.

310
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:52,342
I eat here to avoid the kids.

311
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:56,067
I've done a shameful thing.

312
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,963
I deserve a beating from my junior.

313
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:01,066
I've abused my power just
because I'm a senior.

314
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:02,668
Sorry about that.

315
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:06,472
You should be apologizing
to Mi Rae, not me.

316
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,473
What?

317
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,476
Right, I should apologize to her too.

318
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:14,279
I've been looking for her the past
few days so I could apologize.

319
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:16,077
But it's not easy to spot her.

320
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,484
Do you know where she is?

321
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,988
Do it properly if you're
going to apologize.

322
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,693
Right, I should. I've done
a terrible thing to her.

323
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,666
Should I introduce you to
a good part-time work?

324
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,071
- I'll go first.
- Oh, okay.

325
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,379
What's up with that punk?
Does he like Mi Rae?

326
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,383
He's hot enough to go out with Soo A.
What a lunatic.

327
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,686
Gosh, it's hard to maintain relationships.

328
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:02,394
What's wrong?

329
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,798
Kim Chan Woo?

330
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,099
That Kim Chan Woo?

331
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,200
What does he want?

332
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,802
Did something else happen?

333
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:10,903
No.

334
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,043
Then why is he calling
you out of the blue?

335
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,074
Shall I answer it for you?

336
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,275
No, it's okay.

337
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:21,380
Are you still scared of that jerk?

338
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,148
Hey.

339
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:27,753
We avoid stepping on poop because
it's gross, not because it's scary.

340
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:36,762
What's wrong?

341
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,976
Is he that poop?

342
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:43,769
What does he want?

343
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,876
Hey, Mi Rae. How have you been?

344
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:56,381
Can we go somewhere quiet
and talk for a moment?

345
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:57,909
What is this about?

346
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:02,577
I need to apologize to
her about something.

347
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:11,296
My friend can come too, right?

348
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,197
What?

349
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:15,100
I hate even the thought
of talking just with you.

350
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,971
I see. Right, you must feel that way.
I understand.

351
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,375
Can I get you a cold drink?

352
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,977
No, thanks.

353
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,478
Oh, okay.

354
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:34,720
Hit me and swear at me all you want.

355
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:36,922
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

356
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,625
Violence is the best way to
punish those who are violent.

357
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,227
Why are you being like this suddenly?

358
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,429
You may not believe me,

359
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,943
but I've been very distressed.

360
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:50,536
I'm a senior, but I made
fun of a freshman's looks.

361
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:54,106
Soo A was the one who rejected me,
but I took it out on you.

362
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,909
I'm really sorry.

363
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:01,210
Punch me all you want and forgive me.

364
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,022
Forget it. It's all good if
you regret what you did.

365
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,140
- Hey.
- Does that mean you forgive me?

366
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,625
Get up, please.

367
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,329
Thanks.

368
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:18,830
Let's get on good terms.

369
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,132
All right.

370
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,434
Just don't do things like that again.

371
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,336
Of course, I won't. Never.

372
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,738
Mi Rae was really hurt by what happened.

373
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,242
Be grateful that she's accepting
your apology and forgiving you.

374
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,444
Yes, of course. I am grateful.

375
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:34,246
Then...

376
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,348
I'm off.

377
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:37,749
All right, bye.

378
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,225
What's with him now?

379
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,742
I guess he wanted to apologize to me.

380
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,637
Who's that midget?
Who does she think she is?

381
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,639
Is your dad a congressman too?

382
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,809
Gosh, my knees.

383
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,955
You must be very busy these days.
What brings you all the way here?

384
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,657
I have too much on my mind.

385
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,943
I came here for your
words of encouragement.

386
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:25,230
I'm not sure how helpful I can be,
but I'll do my best.

387
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,306
Then I shall...

388
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:38,210
I'll always think of you
as well in my prayers.

389
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,311
Thank you.

390
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:55,728
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

391
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:57,819
Kyung Seok packed up his
stuff and moved out.

392
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,032
What is the matter with him?

393
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,035
He met Hye Sung.

394
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:06,138
He's mad at me for fooling him
when his mom never cheated on me.

395
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,643
So what? Is he staying with her now?

396
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,946
No, he's with Yoo Jin now.

397
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,349
Then he'll come back home soon.

398
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:21,353
That idiot's bar went out of business.

399
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,243
He's trying to see when
he can move back home.

400
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:27,043
You won't find anything like this.
It's in a great location too.

401
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:31,129
- Oh, I'll show you over there too.
- Okay.

402
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,726
Have a look at this.

403
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,033
Hey, you made it.

404
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,674
For this, you need someone who's
older and experienced. Why me?

405
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:45,577
My mom just knows how to spend.
She doesn't know things like this.

406
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,780
She opened this bar for me when
I didn't know a thing about business.

407
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,881
Can't you tell?

408
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,988
For the premium, we're
thinking 80,000 dollars.

409
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:58,290
80,000 dollars?

410
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,592
I paid 100,000 dollars
when I got this space.

411
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,694
Gosh. The business has
been very slow, you know.

412
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,198
It's not easy to find someone
who's willing to pay this much.

413
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,210
It's been slow because he's not well
versed in how to run a business.

414
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,104
Other business in the area
are still doing great.

415
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,506
The whole place was renovated
only a few months ago.

416
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,007
How could you ask for 20,000 dollars less?

417
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:19,144
Please be considerate of
how much we'd be losing.

418
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,217
Then let's settle at 90,000 dollars.
I can't pay more than that.

419
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:27,152
Sure, let's do that.

420
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,922
Are you out of your mind?

421
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,925
If it's less than that,
I'll get kicked out.

422
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,319
My dad will beat me up to a pulp.

423
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,710
It all comes down to money.

424
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,004
They can't do anything if we cut off
financial support entirely.

425
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:49,307
Right? He'll come back
home and beg me, right?

426
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,410
Don't even help him with his tuition fees.

427
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:55,747
Right, I guess he can figure
out a way to support himself,

428
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,048
but not for a long time.

429
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,018
You must be firm and
strict at times like this.

430
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,320
If you go easy on him,
he'll keep getting worse.

431
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,523
I certainly won't go easy on him.

432
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,025
They say that no parent can
win against their children,

433
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,528
but children can't win against
their parents either.

434
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,296
You know that, right?

435
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,608
When you're here, make sure
you button up your lab coats.

436
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,544
And tie your hair back too.

437
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,447
Tie your hair back. You too.

438
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,143
It's for your safety.

439
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,717
Guys, why did you submit
your report a week late?

440
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,544
- Because of him.
- Because of him.

441
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,723
Can we move along already?
He's such a nagger.

442
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,009
I wonder if he also nags
people around him like this.

443
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:42,610
If he does, he probably has no friends.

444
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,710
Thanks for not being meaner.

445
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:47,315
I have no friends. How did you know?
Has the word already spread?

446
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,834
No, don't mind us.

447
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,602
- We were just kidding.
- All right.

448
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,404
We must strictly follow the protocol.

449
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,883
I don't think you're a nagger.

450
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,809
Also, I think you must be
popular among your friends.

451
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,586
Oh, really? Thanks.

452
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:21,715
What did you want to talk to us about?

453
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:26,092
I have a crush on Woo Young.

454
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,292
- What?
- What?

455
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,810
I want to date him.

456
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,697
I have no idea how to
make that happen though.

457
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:33,712
Give me some advice, girls.

458
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,916
Oh, my goodness.

459
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,509
Yoon Byul, this is crazy.

460
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,420
You're so cute.

461
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,222
Seriously? Do you really
have a crush on him?

462
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:46,424
Have you ever seen her cracking jokes?

463
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,793
How did that happen?

464
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:53,164
I've been observing him, and I
have a lot to learn from him.

465
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,233
He's sensible, and he does
everything by the book.

466
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,935
He's a great role model for all of us.

467
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,037
Plus, he's handsome too.

468
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,373
What should we do with this girl now?

469
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,858
But how are you going to
bring it up directly to him?

470
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:04,876
Why can't I?

471
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,779
As far as I know, he's not
seeing anyone at the moment.

472
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,711
Right, he is single,

473
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,786
but all of his ex-girlfriends
were drop-dead gorgeous.

474
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,187
- Seriously?
- So what?

475
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,826
Yoon Byul is pretty too.

476
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,525
I just wish she was a bit more feminine.

477
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,910
I know, right? Grow your hair
out and put on some makeup.

478
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,598
I like your tomboy style,

479
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,800
but I don't think that's Woo Young's type.

480
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:30,502
What's wrong with my style?

481
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,405
You are pretty.

482
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:38,176
- Hello.
- Hello.

483
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,376
It's been a while, girls.

484
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:44,149
Do you happen to know of any
good part-time position?

485
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:46,551
Why are you asking about
part-time jobs out of the blue?

486
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:49,154
I'm helping Kyung Seok
find a part-time job.

487
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,344
Why would you do that for Kyung Seok?

488
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,459
Kyung Seok and I are close.

489
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:56,158
- You guys are close?
- You guys are close?

490
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:57,862
They say, "After a storm comes a calm."

491
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,831
I apologized and reconciled with him,

492
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,766
and now we're very close.

493
00:35:05,142 --> 00:35:07,472
- Gosh, we're friends.
- You're quite strong.

494
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,144
- My gosh.
- Hey.

495
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,847
Do you guys have part-time jobs?

496
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:12,442
- No.
- No.

497
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,946
You guys have so much to learn.

498
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,649
You should learn from Kyung Seok.

499
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,117
Let's learn from him.

500
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,309
How am I going to get him a part-time job?

501
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:25,223
Gosh, he just shows up out of
nowhere and talks nonsense.

502
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,208
Yoo Jin put his bar up for sale.

503
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,297
Really? Then what's going
to happen to his bar?

504
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:35,100
The bar will still be there, but
it'll have a different owner.

505
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:37,010
He'll be selling it to someone else.

506
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,803
Then what's going to happen to Yoo Jin?

507
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,607
He's completely bankrupt, so
he's going to go back home.

508
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,210
I see.

509
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,315
I'll help you out.

510
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,518
Goodness, thank you.

511
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,720
It's really hot.
You should drink some water.

512
00:35:57,142 --> 00:35:58,523
- You're always so nice.
- It's no big deal.

513
00:35:58,643 --> 00:36:00,925
Woo Young is so sweet.

514
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:04,843
Yoo Jin's two years older than Woo Young.

515
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,343
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- But Woo Young seems way older.

516
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,434
- Should I take it over there?
- Yes.

517
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,281
80 cents.

518
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:36,410
Can I sit next to you?

519
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:39,977
Do whatever you want.

520
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,081
That's our Physics homework.

521
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:57,982
It's due today.

522
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,309
Some questions were pretty hard to solve.

523
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:01,986
Are you stuck on any questions?

524
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:02,987
Not really.

525
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,409
I heard everyone say that the
questions are really hard.

526
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,098
Hey, you solved this one.

527
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,999
Can you teach me how?

528
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:37,943
Do you get it now?

529
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:40,825
I had a hard time solving this question.

530
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,227
Thanks.

531
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,235
Mi Rae.

532
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,437
You're here.

533
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:53,338
Hey.

534
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,643
- Hey, Mi Rae.
- Hi.

535
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,146
Sit here.

536
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:03,615
What?

537
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,316
What's wrong?

538
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:08,210
No, it's nothing.

539
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:23,010
Are you doing homework for Physics?

540
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:25,143
It's nothing.

541
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,987
Hey, Kyung Seok. Did you
move out from home?

542
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,643
- Yes.
- Really?

543
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,044
Gosh, I thought Chan Woo
was talking nonsense.

544
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:37,849
Did you ask him to find a
part-time job for you?

545
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:39,551
- No.
- He's not crazy.

546
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:41,252
Why would he ask him to
look for a part-time job?

547
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,354
Plus, why would Kyung Seok
need a part-time job anyway?

548
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,657
- I do need a part-time job.
- Why?

549
00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:47,342
Because I need to earn money.

550
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,861
Don't you get money from your dad?

551
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,143
No.

552
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:54,866
Really?

553
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,238
Please don't tell anyone
that you live near my place.

554
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:02,640
Soo A, you moved out as well.

555
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,043
Really?

556
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,947
I recently started living by myself.

557
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:10,348
Since when?

558
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,551
It's been a while. It's really fun.

559
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,853
Don't you agree?

560
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,023
Are you guys living together?

561
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,509
- What?
- I'm wondering the same thing.

562
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:23,928
You guys are both from rich families,

563
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,809
but you both moved out
during a similar time.

564
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:30,043
- I smell something fishy.
- Hey.

565
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,943
You're really talking nonsense.

566
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,938
It's not entirely impossible.

567
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,142
Kyung Seok and Soo A are
living in a parallel universe.

568
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,544
You guys look good together.

569
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,546
Why don't you guys just date each other?

570
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:42,847
- Date each other.
- Date each other.

571
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,015
Hey.

572
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,709
You better watch what you say.

573
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,521
I'll watch what I say.

574
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:07,438
Get me a designer handbag for women.

575
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:08,840
For women?

576
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,108
It's for Kyung Hee, so get
me the most trendiest one.

577
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,013
I don't care how much it costs,
so get me the best one.

578
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,417
He's going to give Kyung Hee
a designer handbag?

579
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,659
These two are the most expensive
products in our store.

580
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:31,062
This product was purchased by
top celebrities such as...

581
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,163
...Kim Hye Soo, Kim Nam
Joo, and Ko So Young.

582
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:34,465
This is the only one left.

583
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,167
This one's a limited edition,

584
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,835
and only five of them
were imported to Korea.

585
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,537
It's a very popular item in Hollywood.

586
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:42,143
Many female idols wanted to buy this,

587
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,042
but they all gave up on buying
it because of the price.

588
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,443
I see.

589
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,614
Then I guess this one will be
better suiting for a 17-year-old.

590
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,416
A 17-year-old?

591
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,809
She's so pretty.

592
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,421
Do you think she's a celebrity?

593
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,123
She looks so elegant.

594
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,610
I look forward to working with you.

595
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,809
Me too.

596
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,698
She's the CEO of Kelun.

597
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,300
I heard they'll be doing a
collaboration with our brand.

598
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,569
Please send my regards to your CEO.

599
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:14,305
Okay, I will. We should get going now.

600
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:31,873
What's wrong with the weather?

601
00:41:33,278 --> 00:41:34,692
Let's go.

602
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,594
- Actually...
- Yes?

603
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,908
I'd like one that will
suit a middle-aged woman.

604
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:42,500
Okay, I'll introduce you
to some other products.

605
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,210
You don't have any other
schedules for the day.

606
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:51,009
Do you want me to take you home?

607
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,212
Just a moment.

608
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:04,625
Hey, Ms. Na.

609
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:07,625
I was wondering if we could
meet up for a while.

610
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,627
I have something to ask you.

611
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,629
I'll go to your neighborhood.

612
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,131
Just tell me your address.

613
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,401
Okay, I'll see you later.

614
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:17,869
Bye.

615
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:26,644
You already hired someone?

616
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,743
Okay.

617
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,543
Have you still not found
a part-time job yet?

618
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,055
No.

619
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:39,957
Why don't you apply for
the place I work out?

620
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,759
It's located near our school,

621
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,628
and the owner's really kind.

622
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,543
How much is the pay?

623
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,734
If the owner likes you,

624
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,103
he pays you more than the minimum wage.

625
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,210
Isn't he Do Kyung Seok from
the Chemistry Department?

626
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,110
Will he be working here?

627
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,716
To be honest, we don't really
need to hire anymore part-timers.

628
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,418
Do you know how to make a latte?

629
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,419
No.

630
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,890
Then have you ever worked
as a waiter before?

631
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,891
No.

632
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,694
I've only waited tables
at the school festival.

633
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,702
There won't be much to learn.

634
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,839
You'll just have to stay as
handsome as you are now.

635
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:31,175
Soo A especially asked me for a favor.

636
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:35,246
You can come to work with Soo A
starting from tomorrow.

637
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,248
Okay.

638
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,250
Thank you, sir.

639
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,277
This is great news, isn't it?

640
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,054
Yes.

641
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:50,461
Hey, I think one of us
will end up getting fired.

642
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,676
It'll probably be me.

643
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:55,643
Our manager always hires
people based on their looks.

644
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,036
It sucks to be ugly.

645
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,838
I agree.

646
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:03,441
See? He's calling me right away.

647
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,444
This is so annoying.

648
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,748
Where are you?

649
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,776
I have something to say,
so please come upstairs.

650
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:16,954
- Sir.
- Yes?

651
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:19,473
I'm sorry. I don't think I can work here.

652
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:21,659
- What?
- Bye.

653
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:22,760
Wait.

654
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,968
Good-looking punks are always so rude.

655
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,175
You wanted to see me?

656
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:40,945
Hey, I just wanted to tell you
that you're doing a great job.

657
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,147
- Keep up the good work.
- Pardon?

658
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,049
Get back to work.

659
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,351
Kyung Seok.

660
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,421
What's wrong?

661
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,422
Didn't you know...

662
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,926
...that someone had to quit...

663
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,227
...if I got hired?

664
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:00,431
What are you talking about?

665
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,635
I only did it to help you.

666
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,438
Thank you,

667
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:09,941
but you don't have to care
about me from now on.

668
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,342
Kyung Seok.

669
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,646
You're so mean, you know that?

670
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,548
Is this my fault too?

671
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,153
I just don't want to harm others.

672
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:23,854
Bye.

673
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:47,478
Do Kyung Seok.

674
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,647
Me?

675
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,585
Did you wait for me?

676
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,586
What?

677
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,089
No.

678
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,191
Never.

679
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:11,135
I'm meeting someone here.

680
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:13,137
Who?

681
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,207
Woo Young?

682
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,043
- What?
- Are you meeting him alone?

683
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,144
No.

684
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:23,843
Do you like him?

685
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,018
Do you?

686
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,457
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

687
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:38,062
Why can't you answer?

688
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:39,730
Do you like Woo Young?

689
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,634
Hey, be quiet. It's just
that I'm flustered.

690
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:45,169
But you aren't saying no.

691
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,739
No, I don't like him, satisfied?

692
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:51,575
Okay.

693
00:46:54,075 --> 00:46:55,880
What will you do if someone hears it?

694
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,676
Why do you care about that?

695
00:46:57,975 --> 00:46:59,383
You said you don't like him.

696
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:02,268
Hey, you might not understand,

697
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:05,089
but people usually care about rumors.

698
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:10,294
Ms. Na.

699
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,196
You're here.

700
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,303
Were you waiting for her?

701
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,504
That's right.

702
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:23,309
What about you?

703
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,010
I live nearby here.

704
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:27,211
What?

705
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:30,909
Well, right.

706
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,285
He moved to this neighborhood recently.

707
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:37,021
I see.

708
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,625
How's the stay?

709
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:44,095
It must not be as good as
living in your father's house.

710
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,164
It's manageable.

711
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:48,299
I see.

712
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,903
Let's grab a meal together soon.

713
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:56,707
Let's go, Mi Rae.

714
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,609
Okay.

715
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:03,280
Buy me a meal today.

716
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:07,385
What?

717
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,876
If you don't mind letting me join you.

718
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,590
Of course, you can join us.

719
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,291
You want to?

720
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:29,774
You couldn't even stand the sight of
food like this when you were young.

721
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,080
You might get an upset stomach.

722
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,115
Eat slowly.

723
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,496
Why did you want to see Mi Rae?

724
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,001
Well...

725
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,804
You know, Mi Rae likes perfume.

726
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,706
We're like a mentor and mentee.

727
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,508
That's right.

728
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,211
How are you feeling?

729
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,014
I'm all better now.

730
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,327
Can I order something else?

731
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,228
Of course. What do you want?

732
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:27,131
Soju.

733
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:29,033
Soju?

734
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,335
Yes, or soju bomb.

735
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,639
Shall we?

736
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,743
Excuse me.

737
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,111
Can we have a bottle of soju
and two bottles of beer?

738
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:10,009
Cheers.

739
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:23,109
So he's good at drinking because
he takes after his mother.

740
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,303
This is for me?

741
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:41,906
I got you the most expensive
bag in the store.

742
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:44,108
Don't brag about it too much though.

743
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:50,314
Put your computer back to your room.

744
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,515
Really?

745
00:50:56,409 --> 00:50:58,622
I'm telling you this just in case.

746
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,644
Tell me if you get a call from that woman.

747
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,661
Don't ever meet her.

748
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:28,144
I'm glad you and Mi Rae are neighbors.

749
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:30,743
Do you live alone?

750
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,909
No, I have a roommate.

751
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,124
Is that right?

752
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,630
Aren't you going to ask me...

753
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:41,699
...why I moved out?

754
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,335
Actually,

755
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,904
I knew about it...

756
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:49,139
...because your father came to see me.

757
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,209
I was worried and curious.

758
00:51:56,643 --> 00:51:57,648
But...

759
00:51:58,543 --> 00:52:00,250
I couldn't call you.

760
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,954
Why?

761
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,359
I thought you might not like it.

762
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:23,540
You can really hold your alcohol.

763
00:52:28,402 --> 00:52:32,103
Kyung Seok is famous at school for
being able to hold his liquor.

764
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:34,477
- Really?
- Yes.

765
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,754
I guess...

766
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,857
...I take after you for it.

767
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:56,010
Why don't we call it a
day after this bottle?

768
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:59,516
You're going to school tomorrow,
so you shouldn't drink too much.

769
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:06,183
We already drank too much.

770
00:53:16,242 --> 00:53:18,342
I'll treat you to delicious
food again next time.

771
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:21,043
Thank you.

772
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:25,051
Ms. Na.

773
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,941
Woo Young. Do you live in
this neighborhood too?

774
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,377
He's my roommate.

775
00:53:37,142 --> 00:53:38,542
Really?

776
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:40,943
That's good.

777
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:48,743
Actually, Kyung Seok is...

778
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,360
...my son.

779
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,530
Oh, I see.

780
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,000
How do you two know each other?

781
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:02,106
Professor Park in your department
is very fond of him, you know.

782
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,607
I know him very well.

783
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:06,410
Why don't you come with us to our
place since you're here anyway?

784
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,512
May I?

785
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:11,515
Of course. I even bought a
bottle of soju for Kyung Seok.

786
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:15,219
My gosh, we already drank a little bit.

787
00:54:15,342 --> 00:54:17,621
Then go for your second
round at our place.

788
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:23,594
Well, I feel like I'll
be a nuisance to you.

789
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,195
Not at all. Let's go.

790
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:28,810
Then shall I come in for
just a few minutes?

791
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,243
Mi Rae, you should join us too.

792
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:31,902
This way, please.

793
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,476
I'll just go home.

794
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,876
Why? Come with me.

795
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:51,676
Your place is very neat and cozy.

796
00:54:52,075 --> 00:54:54,491
Kyung Seok doesn't have a bed though.

797
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:55,999
That's not a big deal.

798
00:54:56,109 --> 00:54:58,095
Please take good care of him for me.

799
00:54:58,576 --> 00:55:00,130
Feel free to come by as often as you like.

800
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,243
Next time, I'll bring
some good food with me.

801
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,434
Thanks for everything today.

802
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,543
Gosh, no problem. I didn't
even do anything special.

803
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,573
Then... Cheers, everyone.

804
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:16,146
Isn't that your second one?

805
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,151
I guess you can drink more now.

806
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:23,053
Yes.

807
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,955
Mi Rae, are you really all right?

808
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,957
Yes, I'm totally fine.

809
00:55:27,676 --> 00:55:30,143
By the way, please feel free to
speak casually to me, Ms. Na.

810
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,077
I'm Kyung Seok's friend, you know.

811
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,500
- Can I?
- Of course.

812
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:39,169
I'm happy because you two seem close.

813
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,772
Do we?

814
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,677
Are you seeing anyone at the moment?

815
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,981
- No, I'm not.
- Do you have a crush on anyone?

816
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,177
He probably does.

817
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,489
Really?

818
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:03,293
- Who is it?
- What are you talking about?

819
00:56:03,409 --> 00:56:04,394
Who is this girl?

820
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,996
Is she in first year too? Or is she older?

821
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:07,698
I never said I have a crush on anyone.

822
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:09,733
But you're not denying it either.

823
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:15,975
- I don't have a crush.
- I guess you can't lie.

824
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,275
You couldn't lie at all
even when you were a kid.

825
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,210
Think whatever you want.

826
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,720
Why did you down it like that?

827
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,491
Ms. Na must be the happiest
person at this moment.

828
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,662
Actually, it might be Kyung Seok as well.

829
00:56:42,476 --> 00:56:43,767
What are you...

830
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:45,969
...doing here?

831
00:56:46,276 --> 00:56:47,671
You're all grown up now.

832
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:51,875
Even until just a little while ago,

833
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:57,281
they probably couldn't even imagine
chatting with each other like this.

834
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,876
We all change,

835
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,253
and so do our relationships.

836
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:14,031
And I had no idea...

837
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,236
that I'd meet the person, who
saved my life when I was younger,

838
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,039
again like this.

839
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:25,275
It has nothing to do with you.

840
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:29,178
I also didn't know that I'd be...

841
00:57:29,276 --> 00:57:31,949
...able to call the handsome guy,
Do Kyung Seok, my friend.

842
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:35,085
I guess I'm no longer an outcast.
I have a friend now.

843
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:35,854
What?

844
00:57:37,276 --> 00:57:38,455
You're my friend.

845
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,959
No matter how insignificant the change is,

846
00:57:42,443 --> 00:57:45,244
and although we can't even imagine
its consequences at this moment...

847
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:48,443
- You two look so much alike.
- You think so?

848
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,935
If it's a heartwarming change
like this, it'll be so nice.

849
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:57,243
Others' happiness can
give me this much joy.

850
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,876
I felt it for the very first time.

851
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,384
Mi Rae.

852
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:08,685
- Mi Rae.
- Mi Rae.

853
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:09,886
What should we do?

854
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,176
- Mi Rae.
- Mi Rae.

855
00:58:11,275 --> 00:58:12,389
Gosh.

856
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,793
I'm all right. I'm really okay.

857
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,396
I should take her home. Let me carry her.

858
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:21,398
No, it's okay. I'll carry her.

859
00:58:21,676 --> 00:58:23,192
I'm really okay.

860
00:58:23,276 --> 00:58:25,902
- I'll do it. Put her on my back.
- No, I'll carry her.

861
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,704
- Gosh.
- I'm really all right.

862
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,007
Kyung Seok, you should carry her.

863
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,292
Woo Young, help me.

864
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:33,310
- Oh, okay.
- Mi Rae, I'll help you up.

865
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:36,179
- I'm okay though.
- There.

866
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,584
Don't worry. I'll make sure
she gets home safely.

867
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:41,685
Okay.

868
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,377
Mi Rae, are you all right?

869
00:58:45,476 --> 00:58:46,790
Oh, boy.

870
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:48,976
Yes, I'm fine.

871
00:58:49,089 --> 00:58:50,093
She's not fine at all.

872
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,095
- Woo Young, I'll get going.
- Okay, get home safely.

873
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:54,297
- Make sure she gets home safely.
- Bye.

874
00:58:55,075 --> 00:58:56,099
Be careful.

875
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,769
Get home safely. Hey, be careful.

876
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,207
What's wrong? What happened to her?

877
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:06,410
She passed out after three shots of soju.

878
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,411
What?

879
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,281
Hello.

880
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,784
Aren't you her friend she
brought to the event?

881
00:59:13,876 --> 00:59:15,976
- Yes, I am.
- Where's her bed?

882
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,687
Here, this one.

883
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,270
What happened?

884
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:22,759
Be careful.

885
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,263
She'll be okay, right?

886
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:30,934
Of course, she'll be fine.
Thank you so much.

887
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:35,939
- I'll see you around.
- Oh, thank you.

888
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:40,477
Bye.

889
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:52,504
- Get home safely.
- I will.

890
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,825
I'm so happy for them.

891
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:57,743
What a relief.

892
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,210
You could've moved into my place.

893
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,140
I guess...

894
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,810
...you'll be uncomfortable as we've
been living separately for too long.

895
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:18,815
It's not that.

896
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,819
I wanted to try living independently.

897
01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,923
Shall I give you some spending money?

898
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,094
No, it's okay.

899
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,702
Buy a hangover recovery drink for
Mi Rae tomorrow morning with this.

900
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,272
I don't have any change.

901
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,974
Take it.

902
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:02,692
Can I give you a hug?

903
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:08,365
Yes.

904
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,006
You should come over sometime.

905
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,808
Okay.

906
01:02:41,876 --> 01:02:43,210
Hello.

907
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:46,296
- I'd like a transit pass, please.
- Sure.

908
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:56,006
(No More Hangovers)

909
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:57,507
I'd like to take this too.

910
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,009
Sure.

911
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:23,433
Are you up?

912
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,436
Do you remember anything?

913
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,638
About what?

914
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,977
Do Kyung Seok carried
you home on his back.

915
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:33,109
What?

916
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,211
Ms. Na came too.

917
01:03:38,016 --> 01:03:40,208
They met up to reconcile after
being estranged for years.

918
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,719
Why did you have to tag along
and ruin it all?

919
01:03:42,804 --> 01:03:44,220
What happened?

920
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,409
I don't know.

921
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:50,327
I have class, so I have to leave now.

922
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:53,810
I made hangover soup for you.
Make sure you have some.

923
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:03,376
Gosh, I should've stopped
after my second shot.

924
01:04:21,209 --> 01:04:22,525
Hi.

925
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,531
(No More Hangovers)

926
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,409
I'm fine.

927
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,104
You can't be fine. Isn't three
shots of soju your drinking limit?

928
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:42,843
You should take it.

929
01:05:10,335 --> 01:05:11,641
Is your stomach okay?

930
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,877
Yes, I think I feel better now.

931
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:22,719
Don't worry. You didn't
make any drunken mistakes.

932
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:26,423
What are you talking about?
I heard you carried me home.

933
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:27,524
What about it?

934
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:30,476
I'm sorry for the trouble.

935
01:05:31,776 --> 01:05:35,198
Don't ever drink more than three shots
when I'm not around.

936
01:05:36,075 --> 01:05:36,900
What?

937
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:41,544
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

938
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:11,301
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

939
01:06:11,409 --> 01:06:12,802
Are you her boyfriend?

940
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:13,776
- Yes.
- No.

941
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,072
Why is he being like this?
He's leading me on.

942
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:18,408
Oh, I see Mi Rae and Woo Young over there.

943
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:19,909
You're the prettiest
girl in our department.

944
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,711
Don't you want a boyfriend?

945
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,210
I can be there for an interview today.

946
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,481
Are they hiring for another position?

947
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:27,183
Are you doing a facial mask
for your shift tomorrow?

948
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,685
Do you and Mi Rae work together?

949
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:30,710
- Have you ever cried tears of joy?
- What?

950
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:32,408
I'm not sure if it's
enough to make me cry,

951
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:33,909
but I'm happy that we met again like this.

952
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:36,392
Do they need another
part-timer by any chance?

953
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:38,628
I like Kyung Seok.
