1
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:05,514
I know that it won't be easy. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:08,734
But do it for me, please.

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,981
She's Kyung Seok's mom?

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:14,616
Yes.

5
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:17,914
I guess good looks are
genetically inherited.

6
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:22,292
Are his parents divorced, then?

7
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:27,721
Why doesn't he want to see his mom though?

8
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,147
I don't know.

9
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:34,618
So what are you going to do?

10
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,008
I'd do it if I were you.

11
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:44,181
She saved your life, so what's
there you can't do for her?

12
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,133
Don't say that.

13
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:51,598
It's hard for me to say no to her as well.

14
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:54,647
So don't say such a thing.

15
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:58,097
It's none of my business.

16
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,187
Who's there?

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,380
Hey!

18
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,581
Hello? Someone's been following us.

19
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,128
(Police)

20
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,581
Stop.

21
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:52,773
Stop right there!

22
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:54,871
Stop!

23
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,819
You're one fearless young lady.
Why did you follow him like that?

24
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,214
What if he was actually a bad guy?

25
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,764
Someone has been following
me for the last few days,

26
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,582
but there was no one
whenever I turned around.

27
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,981
That wasn't me.

28
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,081
I saw her for the first time today.

29
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,687
I thought she could be a celebrity,
so I just wanted to check.

30
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:35,981
Then why did you run away?

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,492
She started chasing me, so I got scared.

32
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,229
He's cowardly.

33
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:45,632
He'd never harm anyone.

34
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,833
In any case,

35
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,636
he followed her at this late hour
and gave her the wrong impression.

36
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,039
She must've been so scared.

37
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,748
You punk, aren't I right?

38
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,843
I apologize.

39
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,681
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,748
All right. It's okay, so don't cry.

41
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:06,981
Who is it?

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,447
What kind of jerk did it?

43
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,057
How can I help you, sir?

44
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:12,948
Dad.

45
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,082
He's your dad?

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,689
(Police)

47
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,171
- Take care.
- Don't do that ever again.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,547
- I'm sorry.
- I apologize.

49
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,847
- Goodbye.
- I'm sorry again.

50
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,829
Yes, my dad is here.

51
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,154
Yes, don't worry.

52
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:42,956
Okay.

53
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:51,531
Sir, are you saying you're the
one who has been tailing her?

54
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:58,748
I just wanted to make sure she
gets home safely every night.

55
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,962
Is he really your father?

56
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:06,947
- Yes.
- Sir, I need your ID, please.

57
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,049
I must confirm that you
are indeed her guardian.

58
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,751
Bring it over here now.

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,664
Have you had dinner yet?

60
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,667
Of course. It's late.

61
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:32,606
Mr. Kang Tae Sik, you've
been reported missing.

62
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,407
- Pardon me?
- What?

63
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:37,414
Well, this is...

64
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:39,181
(Name of Missing Person)

65
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,415
The report...

66
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,920
...was filed by someone named Na Eun Shim.
It looks like she's your wife.

67
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,656
- Dad.
- Goodness.

68
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,314
Don't you dare run away again.

69
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:55,048
If you do, I'll really divorce you.

70
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,547
Why did you run away from home?

71
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,981
Mom said you were doing fine.

72
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,948
I am doing fine.

73
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,881
Go in.

74
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:26,578
You should come in.

75
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:29,453
No, it's okay. It's getting
late, so you should go in.

76
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,380
Mr. Kang!

77
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,539
- Long time no see, Hyun Jung.
- You should come up.

78
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:40,764
It's okay. Next time.

79
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,143
Come on, you're already here.
You can't leave like this.

80
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,280
Please come in for a cup of tea. Let's go.

81
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,948
Hey, go and have a seat.

82
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,781
Go.

83
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:28,415
You girls keep your place clean and neat.

84
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:33,048
You will go home, right?

85
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,213
All right.

86
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,367
- It's still hot.
- Oh, okay.

87
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,100
Thanks.

88
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:44,981
It's hot!

89
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:47,582
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

90
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,082
She told you that it's still hot.

91
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,967
Mr. Kang, are you okay?

92
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,182
I'm... I'm okay.

93
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,282
- I'm fine.
- You don't seem okay.

94
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,481
I should get going.

95
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,118
You're leaving already?

96
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,199
Mom.

97
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,910
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,511
My goodness.

99
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:23,430
Let's go. Come on.

100
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,730
You made me worry so much. What happened?

101
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:27,814
Let's talk later.

102
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,963
- You should follow them outside.
- Okay.

103
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,648
Go on.

104
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:39,728
Call me when you get home.

105
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:41,612
Okay, go back inside.

106
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,829
I came all the way here, but
you won't even let me...

107
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,529
talk to my own daughter
or drink a cup of water.

108
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,764
Were you curious of Mi Rae?

109
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:52,349
Then you should've come home.
What kind of nonsense is this?

110
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:54,661
And what was the 5,000 dollars?
Was that my alimony?

111
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:55,765
Are we getting a divorce?

112
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,723
Why would I give you alimony?

113
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:00,634
It was for the hospital fee.

114
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,534
Where did you get 5,000 dollars?

115
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,919
Do you have a separate savings
account that I don't know of? Honey!

116
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,514
Can we meet tomorrow?

117
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:42,148
Hasn't she called yet?

118
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,381
Let's not talk about that.

119
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,513
(Genes of Hankook)

120
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,182
(Genes of Hankook)

121
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,117
I hope Twice comes.

122
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,120
Twice.

123
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,214
Soo A.

124
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:19,829
Hello.

125
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:22,629
You and Kyung Seok need to wait
the tables at the street bar.

126
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,696
Pardon?

127
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,929
- We'll serve tables as well.
- That's right.

128
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,134
I don't think they'll ask
you guys to wait tables.

129
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,808
Why do I need to wait tables?

130
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,096
Because you're the face of our department.

131
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,880
I just volunteered to help out
the face of our department.

132
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,480
Why would she hold me back?

133
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,786
Can you stop hitting on Soo A?

134
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,456
If you want to become like
Kyung Seok, do it properly.

135
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,895
Did you do well on your test?

136
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,466
Yes.

137
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,714
Would you like to have a drink?

138
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,356
Here.

139
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,703
What's wrong?

140
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,042
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,845
For what?

142
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,747
It wasn't your fault...

143
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,850
...that you had to meet her,
but I took it out on you.

144
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,958
Weren't you mad?

145
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,247
I have quite a big heart.

146
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:43,136
What are you doing?

147
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,009
Please don't get angry.

148
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,717
Do you really don't want
to talk to your mom?

149
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:13,081
Is this why you asked
me to drink with you?

150
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:17,604
I didn't know you meant
that you're nosy...

151
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,682
...when you told me that
you have a big heart.

152
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,654
I know this can't compare to
what you've been through,

153
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,525
but I wasn't able to see my
dad for a long time as well.

154
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,329
My dad didn't want me
to get plastic surgery.

155
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,664
But I lied that I'm going
abroad for language studies...

156
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,215
...and got surgery during that time.

157
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,922
And I met him on the day
of our entrance ceremony.

158
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:59,280
Dad.

159
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,048
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,549
I don't know you.

161
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,377
But he got angry and just left.

162
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:24,850
The reason family members
end up hating each other...

163
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,274
...is because they feel upset.

164
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,548
Where's Dad?

165
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,348
Well,

166
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,051
just because, I miss you two.

167
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:48,681
Hello?

168
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,366
What's wrong?

169
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,515
No, it's nothing.

170
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:59,722
Okay, I'll call you again.

171
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:01,447
Bye.

172
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:13,586
He must've suffered a lot until now.

173
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:17,890
Way more than I did.

174
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:31,148
You've grown up so much.

175
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,147
How do I look?

176
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:49,281
I was going to doll myself
up once I became pretty,

177
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,057
but I just didn't have the money.

178
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,496
I can't believe you kept that
much money all to yourself.

179
00:14:57,114 --> 00:15:00,099
Look at me. Do I look weird?

180
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:03,315
What about this one?

181
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,330
Do you not like this one either?

182
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,907
I reconciled with Mi Rae, not you.

183
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,876
That's seriously enough.

184
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:13,079
Would you have let her undergo
surgery if I told you beforehand?

185
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,681
Even if I had to go back in time,
I'd still let her get surgery.

186
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,485
Look.

187
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,889
Look at how cheerful she is.

188
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,892
See? Look.

189
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:34,324
She told me that everyone likes her...

190
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,458
...and that she's having so much fun.

191
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,015
And that made me tear up.

192
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:46,581
Everyone ends up liking Mi Rae.
Who wouldn't?

193
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,181
So are you satisfied?

194
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,581
- What?
- You lied to get plastic surgery.

195
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,891
Well, not exactly.

196
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,576
Why?

197
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,079
Because it's so obvious
that I got plastic surgery.

198
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,366
You also sneered at me.

199
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:31,757
I did?

200
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,927
When?

201
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,030
Forget it if you can't remember.

202
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,332
No, tell me.

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,235
You can't go home before you tell me.

204
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,280
Tell me. When did I sneer at you?

205
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,480
Back when...

206
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,781
...we were at the bus stop.

207
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:13,941
You laughed at me.

208
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,346
You probably don't even remember it,

209
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:21,224
- but I was so...
- I remember.

210
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:25,315
I remember that day vividly,

211
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,167
but I never laughed at you.

212
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,667
I was looking at your feet, not your face.

213
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:45,569
Your feet made me laugh.

214
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,068
I had never seen anyone dance like that.

215
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,682
That's why I asked you at the orientation.

216
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,974
I could tell it was you.

217
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,280
I think...

218
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,282
...I smiled only once throughout
my middle school years.

219
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,310
And it was because of you.

220
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,944
Mi Rae, can't you walk straight?

221
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:37,847
I'm walking straight.

222
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,616
You shouldn't drink if
you're a lightweight.

223
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,616
I have to drink to find out
how much I can handle.

224
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:44,624
How will I know if I never drink?

225
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,649
There was a car coming.

226
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,848
Right.

227
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,523
Thanks.

228
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,696
Are you all right?

229
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,612
Yes.

230
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:41,511
But...

231
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:45,981
...can I see that again?

232
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:51,757
This.

233
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,977
I forgot how to do it.

234
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,467
Wasn't this it?

235
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,514
But the thing is,

236
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:17,516
even if I believe that you
never laughed at me...

237
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,707
Why did you say something
about my perfume?

238
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:23,823
When we were cleaning together.

239
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:29,795
You asked if I was wearing perfume.
You wanted to pick on me, right?

240
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,264
That perfume...

241
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:37,369
It's the scent that I hate the most.

242
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:41,207
That woman's perfume.

243
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,510
Hey.

244
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,480
Are you wearing perfume?

245
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,083
She always stared at
herself in the mirror...

246
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,986
...and sprayed that perfume all over her.

247
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,559
Like a crazy person.

248
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:13,991
Then one day,

249
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,048
she abandoned her children and left.

250
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,614
I wasn't trying to pick on you.

251
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:54,545
But the thing is,

252
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,182
back then...

253
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,691
Shall I take you home?

254
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:07,662
No, it's fine.

255
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,481
Well, then I'm...

256
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm off. Bye.

257
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:54,298
You're Kelun's very first Korean model.

258
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,497
Thank you very much for
accepting our offer.

259
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:58,315
We're honored to work
with the best actress.

260
00:22:58,402 --> 00:22:59,630
The honor is mine.

261
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,747
And I really enjoyed the dinner as well.
Thank you.

262
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,114
I'm glad to hear that.

263
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,130
To tell you the truth, my
taste buds are quite dull.

264
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:09,622
Really? Why?

265
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:14,581
I guess I'm getting old. Many
things aren't how they used to be.

266
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:21,446
How old are you, if you
don't mind me asking?

267
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,515
- I'm 47.
- My gosh.

268
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,302
I assumed you'd be much younger.

269
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:29,854
Don't say that. Now that you know,
you'll think I look my age.

270
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:33,482
Which skincare clinic do you go to?

271
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,216
I don't go to any.

272
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,878
Find out which skincare clinic Ms.
Na goes to.

273
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,362
- I'm going to go there from now on.
- Okay.

274
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,847
(Soo Hyun, Professor Park, Ms. Kim Min Ji)

275
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,981
(Kang Mi Rae)

276
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:04,414
Hi, Mi Rae.

277
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:08,647
I'm sorry. I tried to talk
to him about it, but...

278
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,363
No, it's okay. I asked you,
knowing how hard it'd be.

279
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:14,781
I'm sorry.

280
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,547
Don't worry. Please just forget about it.

281
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,241
But we should meet up anyway.

282
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,828
You can visit me at my office.

283
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:26,149
- All right.
- Okay.

284
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:28,747
Good night.

285
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:52,391
Mi Rae, can't you walk straight?

286
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:57,481
I'm walking straight.

287
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,433
You shouldn't drink if
you're a lightweight.

288
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,636
I have to drink to find out
how much I can handle.

289
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:26,048
(To: Na Hye Sung)

290
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:29,733
Hey, Mi Rae. Mi Rae.

291
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:32,239
I have big news.

292
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:34,157
The rapper wants to see me.

293
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,342
- Seriously?
- Yes.

294
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,063
I sent him the lyrics that I wrote,

295
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:38,648
and he asked me to visit his studio.

296
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:42,144
What should I do? I haven't
had any time to practice.

297
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:45,366
Oh Hyun Jung!

298
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:47,163
Hey, are you mocking me now?

299
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,781
Of course not.

300
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,968
Gosh, I have to practice more.

301
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,456
I never laughed at you.

302
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,754
I was looking at your feet, not your face.

303
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,115
Your feet made me laugh.

304
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,528
I had never seen anyone dance like that.

305
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,231
I wasn't trying to pick on you.

306
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:18,410
I misjudged Kyung Seok.

307
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:34,093
Are you all right?

308
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:36,113
Hey.

309
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:37,796
Hey.

310
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:44,603
You crazy jerk.

311
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:50,409
Kyung Seok has never been...

312
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,711
...mean to me.

313
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,894
I must be crazy.

314
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,498
I smiled only once...

315
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,200
...throughout my middle school years.

316
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,303
And it was because of you.

317
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:34,179
A college festival is all about
having crowded street bars.

318
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:35,963
Why won't they let us sell alcohol?

319
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,063
It was just a light notification,
so can't we just sell it?

320
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:41,760
No, they even told us to buy
food from nearby markets...

321
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,263
...because they don't want us
violating the Food Sanitation Act.

322
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,564
Hello.

323
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:48,048
Then how are we going to make money?

324
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,568
I know.

325
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,615
We need to make enough for the
second half of the semester.

326
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:57,562
We'll just have to do a lot of PR.

327
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:58,577
Okay.

328
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,747
I heard there's a really pretty
girl among our freshmen this year.

329
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,348
I think her name was Hyun Soo A.

330
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,951
Yes, she's one of a kind.

331
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:09,063
There's this good-looking guy
named Do Kyung Seok as well.

332
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,648
- Do Kyung Seok?
- Yes.

333
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,457
I don't think he'll do it.

334
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:15,460
Why? Is he the type that
doesn't listen to his seniors?

335
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:19,463
He's the guy who beat Chan Woo up.

336
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:22,568
Oh, that's him? My gosh.

337
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:24,948
I love him already.

338
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:32,415
We can make Soo A and
Kyung Seok wait tables.

339
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:34,336
Who else can we choose?

340
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,263
Ji Hyo?

341
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:39,063
We should add 1 or 2 more people.

342
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:42,040
Eun, you should notify them and
bring them to the meeting later.

343
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,437
Okay.

344
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,956
What do you think about Mi Rae?

345
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,706
Oh, her? She's beautiful.

346
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:49,914
- Gosh, of course.
- Yes.

347
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:52,023
She's very pretty.

348
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:54,539
Then let's add Mi Rae to the list.

349
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,997
Nice.

350
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:18,490
What's wrong with me? He's
not even that attractive.

351
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,697
All that's changed is that he
wasn't such a jerk after all.

352
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:27,633
That's all. But why...

353
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,928
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

354
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,994
Did you get home safely?

355
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:58,196
Yes, of course.

356
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,075
Did you sleep well?

357
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,726
I must be crazy. Why would I ask him that?

358
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:04,703
What are your plans for the festival?

359
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:06,805
- The festival?
- Are you going to come to school?

360
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,492
I'm not sure. I'm a
little busy these days.

361
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:11,908
You're busy?

362
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:15,092
Yes, everyone's busy. I'm
sure you're busy as well.

363
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,882
I'm not busy.

364
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,384
I see.

365
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:22,888
Lucky you. I'll be off now.

366
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,294
Kyung Seok.

367
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:32,798
Would you like to wait tables
on the day of the festival?

368
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,008
No.

369
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:35,392
Okay.

370
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:41,859
I was wondering if you'd like
to wait tables at the festival.

371
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,543
Min A told me about that.

372
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,678
I guess I have no choice but to help out.

373
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,175
I heard it's mandatory for
people who are pretty.

374
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:52,050
The seniors asked if you could do
it as well. Are you interested?

375
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,151
What?

376
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,254
Is the festival this week?

377
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,433
Isn't it next week?

378
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,458
Oh, is it next week?

379
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,727
Okay, I'll do it.

380
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:03,695
What about Mi Rae?

381
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,597
I need to ask her.

382
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,393
Yes, she should join as well.

383
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:19,826
I was planning to sell scented
candles at the festival.

384
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:24,227
Can you do that after you wait tables?

385
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:28,019
Can't you just put out an
announcement and gather volunteers?

386
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,526
Well...

387
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:33,392
The seniors picked the candidates.

388
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,594
It's driving me crazy.

389
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,808
And they want me to do it?

390
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:43,068
Yes, they picked you, Soo A, and Ji Hyo.

391
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,671
Gosh, why can't we just get volunteers?

392
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,609
Hey, I'll do it.

393
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,975
What? How long were you in there?

394
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,426
I think it's been about 10 minutes.
I have constipation these days.

395
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:07,275
They just want the pretty
ones to wait tables,

396
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,027
and I can't because I'm not pretty.

397
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:13,308
Hey, you guys.

398
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:14,720
Hey.

399
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:21,106
Did Eun ask you to wait
tables at the festival yet?

400
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:27,008
Yes, I told her that I'll think about it.

401
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:28,914
Come on, let's do it. I'll be doing it.

402
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,516
If you refuse, it'll only burden Eun.

403
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,718
Right.

404
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,420
I guess I should do it.

405
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,523
Yes. I think it'll be fun.

406
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,940
By the way, about you and Kyung Seok...

407
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,141
Yes?

408
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,675
I thought you guys didn't
know each other at first...

409
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,640
...because you acted like total strangers.

410
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,993
Well...

411
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,444
We weren't that close.

412
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,759
- Really?
- Yes.

413
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,952
Look at this.

414
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:09,321
My gosh, she's pretty.

415
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,523
I know her.

416
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,525
How do you know her?

417
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,627
I don't know her in person.

418
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,345
She's the prettiest girl
in Hankook University.

419
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,363
What?

420
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,092
She's really pretty.

421
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,093
Why would someone like
her like your photo?

422
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:29,641
Because she liked the photo
I uploaded, you punk.

423
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,110
I'm going to capture this.

424
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,512
The prettiest girl in Hankook
University liked my photo.

425
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,208
I think she liked it by mistake.

426
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,815
No, she didn't.

427
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,383
Stop it.

428
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:39,808
- Hello.
- Hello.

429
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,286
- Are you guys having a meeting?
- Yes.

430
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,793
Woo Young, you need to bring a
lot of friends to the festival.

431
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:45,508
I'm not sure if I'll have time.

432
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,108
I need to go room searching
when I don't have classes.

433
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,093
Are you moving?

434
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,695
Yes, the landlord wants to raise
the deposit and monthly rent.

435
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,075
- Really? That's absurd.
- Yes.

436
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,075
- Did you plan some stuff?
- No, not yet.

437
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,108
- Hello.
- Hey, you guys.

438
00:33:57,192 --> 00:33:59,160
- Hello.
- Hi.

439
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:00,774
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

440
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,975
- Bye.
- Bye.

441
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,593
- See you, Woo Young.
- Bye.

442
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,379
Gosh, the room brightened up
as soon as you guys entered.

443
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,080
- Thank you.
- My gosh.

444
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,782
Their names are Mi Rae, Soo A, and Ji Hyo.

445
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,275
- You met Eun before, right?
- Yes.

446
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,487
- Hey, you guys.
- Hello.

447
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,589
=- You guys should sit down.
- Okay.

448
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,460
- Take a seat.
- Sit down.

449
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:21,892
She looks so cute.

450
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,664
Her eyes are round and big.
And her face...

451
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:30,435
How could you come later
than the waitresses?

452
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,037
Be easy on her. She flunked
class to come here.

453
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,375
My gosh.

454
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:37,042
Some of you don't know each other,
so let's all introduce ourselves.

455
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:38,777
- You go first.
- Okay.

456
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,573
Hi, I'm Jo Jung Yeob, the
head of the junior year.

457
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,874
- Hello.
- Hello.

458
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,676
You guys all know me, right? I'm Ko Ye Na.

459
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,403
I'm Kwon Yoon Byul, the
head of the sophomore year.

460
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,787
She was a girl?

461
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,508
You guys all thought she was a guy, right?

462
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,829
See? Everyone who sees you for the
first time thinks of you as a guy.

463
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,092
Next.

464
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,299
Why aren't you introducing yourself?

465
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,400
You're going to make fun
of me again, aren't you?

466
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:04,402
No. Go on.

467
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:09,808
I'm a sophomore, and my
name is Kim Tae Hee.

468
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,509
She's Fat Tae Hee.

469
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,612
Hey.

470
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:17,015
Why would you change her name like that?

471
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,417
- She looks just like Kim Tae Hee.
- She's pretty.

472
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,121
By the way, you guys must feel great.

473
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:25,557
You got picked as the prettiest
girls in first year.

474
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:26,741
- Sorry?
- Come on.

475
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:30,128
Don't act like you don't know.
I heard you're number one.

476
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,342
Number one? But we don't
have our marks yet.

477
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,468
We're talking about your
face, not your grades.

478
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,571
Soo A, I think you're putting on
an act when you know everything.

479
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:43,208
No, not at all. And I'm
certainly not number one.

480
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,811
What about Do Kyung Seok? He won't do it?

481
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,425
- No.
- You should've persuaded him.

482
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:50,915
He said no right away.

483
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,242
- Shall I try to lure him?
- Sorry?

484
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:55,420
Hey, forget it. I'd be nice to
have a good-looking guy too,

485
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,642
but we usually have girls wait
the tables anyway, so it's okay.

486
00:35:57,726 --> 00:35:58,960
You're right.

487
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,558
But why?

488
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,829
What do you mean? It's just our tradition.

489
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,852
I like how you put it.
"It's just our tradition."

490
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:08,967
- Write it down.
- Okay.

491
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,835
I should write it down. "Tradition".

492
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:13,638
- "Just our tradition".
- What are you doing? Write it down.

493
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,340
- Gosh.
- "Just our tradition".

(Hyunmoo Real Estate Office)

495
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,048
Many Hankook University students
live in this neighborhood...

496
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:24,977
- ...because it's close to school.
- I see.

497
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,361
The owner put up new wallpaper
throughout the place recently.

498
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,642
- It's clean, isn't it?
- Did he do it himself?

499
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:41,660
It's a bit damp because he put the
wallpaper directly on the wall.

500
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,559
It feels fine to me.

501
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,540
Is your palm sweaty?

502
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,075
You don't even need to
test the water pressure.

503
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,459
It's perfect.

504
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:03,294
If you want to take this
place, you should hurry.

505
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,975
Another student will come by
later in the day to see it.

506
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,093
- I'll check out a few more places.
- All right.

507
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,196
It's you, right? Mi Rae's TA.

508
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,908
Oh, hello. You're Hyun Jung, right?

509
00:37:12,992 --> 00:37:15,600
- Oh, you remember my name.
- Of course.

510
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,802
- Do you live in this area?
- Yes.

511
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,393
- Do you live around here too?
- No, I'm checking out some places.

512
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:23,108
Are you thinking of moving here?

513
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:26,493
There's a newly built low-rise
multiplex down the street.

514
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,393
There's a nice apartment in that building.

515
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,693
- I'd love to see it.
- Then let's go.

516
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:32,417
Oh, that building.

517
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:36,921
I know this neighborhood
like the back of my hand.

518
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,724
- Shall I keep you company?
- Gosh, it's okay.

519
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:43,628
It's totally fine with me. I have
nothing to do, and I'm free all day.

520
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:48,733
This time, we have to
actively promote the event,

521
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,136
so I'm thinking of changing
the uniform to a skirt.

522
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,538
- I don't like that idea.
- You won't even have to wear it.

523
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,108
Tae Hee won't wear it either.

524
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,108
Why drag me into this? I
didn't even say anything.

525
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,511
You stand out even if you
don't say anything...

526
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,212
...because you're so chubby.

527
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,217
That's not "chubby".

528
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,719
Her weight is normal.

529
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:10,321
So all of you are against the skirt idea?

530
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:13,491
I can wear whatever.

531
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,293
Me too.

532
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:18,193
- I don't care either.
- Are you going to do it too?

533
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,999
Why would a wilted flower serve
when we have so many fresh ones?

534
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,175
What did you just say?

535
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,802
She's not a wilted flower yet.

536
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,504
- Do you still have a crush on her?
- Do you still like me?

537
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,408
- My goodness.
- All right, enough.

538
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:30,975
Jung Ho and Ye Na, pick out a
new uniform within our budget.

539
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,793
Okay, then can you girls tell me
your sizes? Soo A, you first.

540
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:35,826
Hey, I'll write the sizes down.

541
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,115
Soo A.

542
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,675
Small usually fits me well.

543
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:41,526
- Small.
- Me too.

544
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,808
- Extra small.
- No, just small.

545
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,423
Extra small.

546
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,408
I usually get large.

547
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,196
Large? But you're slim.

548
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,575
I'm quite tall, you know.

549
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:56,668
Right, you're tall. One large size.

550
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,604
I must say, we picked the perfect servers.

551
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,006
Soo A and Mi Rae have
contrasting charms, you know.

552
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:04,108
Contrasting charms?

553
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,926
Soo A has that innocent, pure
look, whereas Mi Rae is sexy.

554
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:09,726
What?

555
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,217
You're saying I look immature and
short compared to her, right?

556
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,320
Right, you're cute, and
you have a baby face.

557
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,824
Let's wrap it up here if you're
going to keep blabbering away.

558
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:26,818
Now, we should talk about...

559
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:28,590
For 400 dollars a month with
a 5,000-dollar deposit,

560
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:30,902
you won't find a better
apartment than this.

561
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,175
I see.

562
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,906
There are security cameras in
the building, so it's safe too.

563
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,511
This means the passcode got leaked.

564
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,086
What do you say? Shall I tell the
landlord to come meet us here?

565
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:49,487
Not yet. I'll see a few more places.

566
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:52,991
Gosh, You, young man, are very picky.

567
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,394
Hey, when will you be home?

568
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:02,200
I see. All right.

569
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,808
- Was that Mi Rae?
- Yes.

570
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:06,774
She'll be home late as the
meeting is dragging on.

571
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,706
- Do you two live together?
- Yes.

572
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:11,659
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

573
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:13,378
Don't thank me for this. I feel so bad.

574
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:15,980
Gosh, please don't feel bad. I
volunteered to accompany you.

575
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,692
No, don't say that. Thank
you so much for your help.

576
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:22,086
- Do you want to grab a beer later?
- Sorry?

577
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,392
Somewhere near school.
Mi Rae can join us too.

578
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:27,892
- Sure.
- Shall we go, then?

579
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:40,004
What? A wilted flower? And what's
wrong with my style? That was crazy.

580
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:43,508
Had I not been a freshman, I
would've caused a big scene.

581
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,779
Let's not be like that when
we're in our senior year.

582
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:51,783
I don't even like the idea
of having to wear skirts.

583
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,893
It'll be uncomfortable to work in a skirt.

584
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:56,287
It'd be a different story if
all of us were against it,

585
00:40:56,392 --> 00:40:58,690
but Soo A and Ji Hyo are
okay with it, you know.

586
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,092
Yes.

587
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,867
Are you there alone?

588
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:13,993
Okay, all right.

589
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,393
Jung Boon is having a beer,
and she wants me to come.

590
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:19,811
You should come too.

591
00:41:21,892 --> 00:41:25,292
My roommate must be waiting for
me to have dinner together.

592
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,020
Just a second.

593
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:38,029
Hey. Yes, it's done.

594
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:43,334
Who? Our TA?

595
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:49,007
Okay.

596
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:08,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

597
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,993
Goodbye.

598
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:12,093
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

599
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:36,292
- Come with me for a second.
- Why? What's up?

600
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:39,793
Hey, let go. Gosh, it hurts.

601
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,425
Hey, let go of my hand.

602
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:44,859
It hurts so badly.

603
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,614
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

604
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:51,907
- You see...
- Jung Boon.

605
00:42:52,592 --> 00:42:55,342
I guess you got the wrong idea...

606
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:58,409
...because I've been so nice to you.

607
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,513
I have no feelings for you.

608
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,917
Gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't want
to hurt your feelings like this.

609
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:08,619
That's not what I'm trying to tell you.

610
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,721
Listen carefully, okay?

611
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:14,525
That girl is a thief.

612
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,360
What?

613
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:22,633
I saw her stealing money.

614
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:25,203
Don't set foot in my bar ever again.

615
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,308
I didn't want to get angry at
you, but this is way out of line.

616
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:29,907
- Well...
- Forget it.

617
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,976
I don't even want to see you again.

618
00:43:35,492 --> 00:43:38,082
I didn't pay for my beer.

619
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,926
Don't worry. I'll just think
that someone stole the beer.

620
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:47,692
Hey, Jung Boon.

621
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,392
Yes, forget it. We're through!

622
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,561
Was she going out with
the owner of Berlin?

623
00:43:55,645 --> 00:43:58,279
No. Hey, Jung Boon!

624
00:44:02,492 --> 00:44:03,726
Mi Rae.

625
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:09,692
Hello.

626
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:12,893
- Have you been waiting long?
- No.

627
00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:23,386
Have you had dinner yet?

628
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:25,508
Yes.

629
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:27,783
If you're getting hungry,
come and have some lobsters.

630
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:30,117
I steamed them just now,
so they're very good.

631
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:32,427
- You steamed lobsters this late?
- Yes.

632
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:35,741
Kyung Hee asked me to
steam some right at 9pm.

633
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:37,704
She took one and went upstairs.

634
00:44:46,196 --> 00:44:47,960
(Do not enter, do not knock)

635
00:44:54,085 --> 00:44:55,598
You're back. How was your day?

636
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:05,489
Lobster is my favorite
nighttime snack of the moment.

637
00:45:05,574 --> 00:45:08,673
I've been eating one every night.

638
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:12,376
All right. I'll cut it up first.

639
00:45:15,892 --> 00:45:18,783
Well, lobster is my staple,

640
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,885
so this is a piece of cake.

641
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:24,789
And to do this well, you need
technique, not strength.

642
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:29,794
Here. Do you see how plump it is?

643
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,397
I'll try eating this now.

644
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:41,305
Tell Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee...

645
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:43,708
...that their mom wants to see them.

646
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:51,227
Why are you standing there?

647
00:45:51,724 --> 00:45:53,222
Come in if you have something to say.

648
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,832
Do you really have to send
Kyung Hee off to the States?

649
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,041
Why are you asking that?

650
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:08,125
It's not like she wants to go.

651
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:09,959
She's being forced to go.

652
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,737
I should've sent her off sooner.

653
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:16,726
I postponed it not to cause a
ruckus before the election.

654
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,431
I wouldn't send her there...

655
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,495
if her grades were high enough
for good universities here.

656
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,593
So it's not for her sake.

657
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,182
It's to save your reputation.

658
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:28,993
An American university sounds better
even if it's not prestigious.

659
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:31,289
What did you say?

660
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:39,108
You must be saying this because
you feel bad to send her away.

661
00:46:39,192 --> 00:46:42,359
It's the best for her. She'll
at least learn English there.

662
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:50,559
That woman came back to Korea.

663
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:54,726
She might shamelessly contact
you after what she's done,

664
00:46:56,326 --> 00:46:59,660
having an affair with a young
punk and abandoning her children.

665
00:47:02,225 --> 00:47:04,792
I don't think you'll let her see you,

666
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:06,559
but I'm telling you just in case.

667
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:33,525
(Kang Mi Rae)

668
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,993
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

669
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,872
It's a rooftop house, but
it has air conditioner.

670
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:53,439
The heating system works well in winter.
I think it's a good deal.

671
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,175
When are you moving then?

672
00:47:56,259 --> 00:47:58,266
I'll pack my stuff tomorrow
and move the day after.

673
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,885
I have no class during the festival,
so I'll get it done in the meantime.

674
00:48:00,992 --> 00:48:03,686
Actually, if you invest a
little more on the deposit,

675
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,482
you'll have a lot of better options.

676
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:07,893
Well, my budget is limited.

677
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:10,468
I earn less as a teaching assistant
than my undergraduate times.

678
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,581
Do you pay for your living expenses too?

679
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,191
Even my tuition too.

680
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,275
- Awesome.
- Even your tuition too?

681
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,675
I luckily got scholarships a few times.

682
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,899
I had so many various part-time jobs too.

683
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:23,567
That's amazing.

684
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,903
- Cool.
- It's really cool.

685
00:48:26,025 --> 00:48:28,706
Come on. You can do it when
you're forced in such a situation.

686
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,525
- Let's clink.
- Cheers.

687
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:39,008
I thought I needed to take a few
breaks, but I was really lucky.

688
00:48:39,092 --> 00:48:41,485
I tutored a student, and his grades
suddenly went up dramatically.

689
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,421
Words spread which helped me
tutor some more students.

690
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:46,208
He didn't study, but
he was actually smart.

691
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,741
It must've been because of
your nice tutoring skills...

692
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,394
...that helped his grades go up.

693
00:48:50,526 --> 00:48:52,841
- No, no.
- You're right.

694
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:54,832
- You want some more beer?
- Sure.

695
00:48:57,825 --> 00:48:59,342
It's okay.

696
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:01,439
I thought it'd take several days
for me to decide on my new house,

697
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:03,360
but I saved a lot of time thanks to you.

698
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:05,759
Can we have three more glasses of beer?

699
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:07,058
Sure.

700
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:10,924
By the way, please feel free
to talk casually to us.

701
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:12,408
What?

702
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:16,107
I mean it's awkward to hear
you talk to us so politely.

703
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:17,535
We're your juniors, you know.

704
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,627
Right, it'd be great if
you talk to us casually.

705
00:49:21,997 --> 00:49:23,214
Will that be comfortable for you?

706
00:49:23,306 --> 00:49:24,573
- Yes.
- Yes.

707
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:27,627
Then...

708
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:29,436
should I?

709
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:33,375
That's way better. It felt so suffocating.

710
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:35,075
In that sense, let's clink.

711
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:37,259
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

712
00:49:38,426 --> 00:49:39,793
Hi, there.

713
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:44,642
I came to help you, but
you aren't busy at all.

714
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:47,108
Don't joke around with my means of living.

715
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,093
I'm not in the mood for
your jokes right now.

716
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:55,874
It's usually hard for me to
talk casually to others.

717
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,796
- There you go again.
- Oops, sorry.

718
00:49:57,907 --> 00:50:01,392
- Please don't be so polite to us.
- I won't, for certain.

719
00:50:01,526 --> 00:50:03,308
- Eat up, guys.
- Shall we?

720
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:04,709
- Let's eat.
- Go ahead.

721
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,427
- It looks delicious.
- It is good.

722
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:12,305
What are you doing?

723
00:50:22,582 --> 00:50:24,286
Your order is two cups of Americano.

724
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,405
Gosh, this is crazy.

725
00:50:26,905 --> 00:50:28,707
- She's prettier in person.
- Right?

726
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:29,786
Hello.

727
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:33,030
Can I have one vanilla latte
and caffe mocha each?

728
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,808
You look intimidated.

729
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:36,292
No way.

730
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,204
Look at him.

731
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,940
Are you ready to order?

732
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:48,692
Should I help you with your order?

733
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:51,609
Three Americanos, please.

734
00:50:51,693 --> 00:50:53,375
Three Americanos, right?

735
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:54,659
Ouch.

736
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:57,388
You want them to be hot?

737
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:58,760
Yes.

738
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:03,202
Here.

739
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:05,360
Thank you.

740
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:08,525
Here you go.

741
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:10,459
Thank you.

742
00:51:22,824 --> 00:51:24,124
Excuse me.

743
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:27,052
- Yes?
- My name is Park Yong Chul.

744
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,920
You liked my photos on Instagram.

745
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:31,542
Oh, hello.

746
00:51:31,626 --> 00:51:34,860
I was surprised that you
didn't recognize me.

747
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,258
- She recognizes him.
- Sorry.

748
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:40,126
She's really pretty by the way.

749
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,592
What are they talking about?

750
00:51:46,492 --> 00:51:47,774
What did you guys talk about?

751
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:50,258
She apologized for not recognizing me.

752
00:51:50,426 --> 00:51:53,826
She'll leave work soon and she wants
to grab beer with me if it's okay.

753
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,525
What should I do?

754
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:57,808
It must be a lie.

755
00:51:57,939 --> 00:51:59,049
Right?

756
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:08,893
- Let me in.
- Me too.

757
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,159
This is what I'm capable of.

758
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,959
You transferred to another
school after a year, right?

759
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,041
13 months.

760
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,892
But everyone knew about him.

761
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:21,866
Are you aware that your
nickname was Rain Kyung Seok?

762
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:23,349
What's that?

763
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:25,651
All the boys copied how you
would walk in the rain.

764
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:26,677
Didn't you know?

765
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,175
Why would they copy such a thing?

766
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,475
I walked in the rain
because I had no umbrella.

767
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,391
Gosh, that's annoying.

768
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:34,763
Do you want me to say that they
copied you because you looked cool?

769
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:36,008
It's nothing cool though.

770
00:52:36,092 --> 00:52:38,681
So Kyung Seok was really popular.

771
00:52:38,785 --> 00:52:39,768
Didn't you guys like him?

772
00:52:39,892 --> 00:52:41,181
No, I didn't.

773
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:44,795
It simply felt like I was
seeing a handsome celebrity.

774
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:46,797
You might become better at drinking.

775
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,100
What?

776
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:55,027
Well...

777
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,991
Mi Rae said she is going
to wait the tables.

778
00:52:58,089 --> 00:52:59,208
What are you doing during
the festival, Kyung Seok?

779
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,811
You're going to wait the tables?

780
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:02,709
- Yes.
- You said you were busy.

781
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:04,093
Did I?

782
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,518
Well, yes. I am busy.

783
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:11,121
But the department needs my help.

784
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:16,627
Are you coming to the festival?

785
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:19,329
I don't know if I'll have time to come by.

786
00:53:19,426 --> 00:53:20,698
I'll go when I'm pretty
much done unpacking.

787
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,499
Do you want me to help
you with the unpacking?

788
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:24,001
No, thanks.

789
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,603
I'll hold a housewarming party after
I'm done, so come visit then.

790
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,993
Good.

791
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,008
Come with her if you
have time too, Mi Rae.

792
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:31,292
Okay.

793
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:39,879
You want to come too?

794
00:53:39,964 --> 00:53:41,080
Why are they going?

795
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,393
Because...

796
00:53:42,478 --> 00:53:44,789
Because they live in
the same neighborhood.

797
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,690
My new house is located near their house.

798
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:51,850
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

799
00:53:52,034 --> 00:53:53,530
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

800
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:08,346
Hey, it's nervous to drink
with those handsome guys...

801
00:54:08,447 --> 00:54:11,548
...that it keeps me
sober, don't you agree?

802
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,854
Hey.

803
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,956
When will you hold that
housewarming party?

804
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,959
Are you really coming?

805
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,365
You're more sociable than you look.

806
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,869
Or do you like either of them?

807
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,360
Let's set the date that's
agreeable for all of us.

808
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,227
I'm going this way. What about you?

809
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:44,715
Bye.

810
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:03,519
- Hello.
- Hello.

811
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:09,683
Slow down.

812
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,658
Mi Rae, you're really slim.

813
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:17,048
- What?
- I'm envious of your pretty looks.

814
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:18,248
Me?

815
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:21,008
You look way prettier though.

816
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:24,822
Don't be like that. Guys
always tease me for being fat.

817
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:26,423
You aren't fat.

818
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,493
Right, you're not fat at all.

819
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,296
Guys and girls have different
standards in being fat.

820
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,999
She should be considered
average, don't you think so?

821
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,100
What?

822
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:39,909
She's rather chubby.

823
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,778
I thought you were cute and
pretty when I saw you.

824
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,379
Don't say that.

825
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,993
To be honest, a lot of people say I
might look pretty if I lose weight.

826
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,692
But losing weight isn't easy.

827
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,559
It's really hard to lose weight.

828
00:56:00,592 --> 00:56:02,293
Tae Hee.

829
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,292
There you go again.

830
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,727
I'll take this away for your sake.

831
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:09,304
You said you'd go on a diet.

832
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:12,002
Your whole life will change
only if you lose weight.

833
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:14,471
Why would you do that when she was eating?

834
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:18,675
I just feel sorry how she's
wasting her pretty face.

835
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,774
She's this cute even when she's fat.

836
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:21,979
Imagine how much prettier she'll
be once she loses weight.

837
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:23,408
You promised,

838
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,282
so make some effort.

839
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,709
- Hurry, guys. What are you doing?
- Okay.

840
00:56:26,793 --> 00:56:28,908
I never made that promise.

841
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:30,787
I'm grateful for your
compliment about my face,

842
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,090
but let me take care of my
life and my business myself.

843
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,592
You've been saying that for a year.

844
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,395
You can be as pretty as Soo
A once you lose weight.

845
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,774
Please don't say that.

846
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:42,966
I'm not even pretty.
People might criticize me.

847
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,342
I'm sure Soo A's also making efforts
with or without others knowing.

848
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,971
She must go on diets too, right?

849
00:56:49,478 --> 00:56:52,478
My skinny body has been my
concern since I was little.

850
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:54,526
I see.

851
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:56,575
Come on, Soo A.

852
00:56:56,659 --> 00:56:59,082
The girls might get annoyed.

853
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,675
There are people who never gain weight.

854
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,693
- There are that kind of people.
- How's the preparation going?

855
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:08,008
Hey, I don't think we have enough tables,

856
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:09,393
so can we prepare a few mats just in case?

857
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:10,927
That'd be good.

858
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:12,408
Haven't the uniforms arrived yet?

859
00:57:12,492 --> 00:57:14,492
They're here.

860
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:20,908
What's taking the girls so long?

861
00:57:20,992 --> 00:57:23,526
- They're getting changed.
- Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

862
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:30,162
I wish I was born as a pretty girl
so that I could take orders only.

863
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:31,799
It's a bar run by the
chemistry department.

864
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:35,675
Come visit our bar.

865
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:36,993
- Okay.
- Okay.

866
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,213
I feel too apologetic to Jung Boon.
What should I do?

867
00:57:41,526 --> 00:57:42,508
You should apologize then.

868
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:46,298
I mean, I feel too sorry to apologize.

869
00:57:46,406 --> 00:57:48,140
Then you should apologize
that you're really sorry.

870
00:57:49,627 --> 00:57:50,861
Let's go.

871
00:57:51,246 --> 00:57:52,550
Go where?

872
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,420
Our department's bar.

873
00:57:55,059 --> 00:57:56,593
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

874
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,859
That's the uniform?

875
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,547
- I don't like it.
- Me neither.

876
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,951
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

877
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:45,542
I can sense the breeze of success already.

878
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:47,324
It's just as I imagined.

879
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:48,741
Why these punks...

880
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,827
Why do you nag me so much? You have
someone you want to see there?

881
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:51,862
You're here.

882
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,764
- She's that pretty girl.
- Kang Mi Rae?

883
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,442
What's wrong? I'm just glad...

884
00:58:55,526 --> 00:58:57,342
- ...to see Kang Orc again.
- Hey.

885
00:58:57,426 --> 00:58:59,874
Park Yong Chul's profile shows
which schools he went to.

886
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,442
Soo A, that girl, might have done
it to mess with you on purpose.

887
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:04,709
She was cute. Mi Rae was cute.

888
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,520
Then again, I'm being careful these days.
She's from our department.

889
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:08,609
Can't we point to the person right away?

890
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:10,609
Who is it that you like?

891
00:59:10,693 --> 00:59:11,915
This person.
