1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,113
Just go with your heart, Mi Rae.

2
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:15,615
So don't cry, okay?

3
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,406
You don't have to walk me to the door.

4
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:17,448
All right, go in now. Don't come
back out like you did last time.

5
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:19,212
Okay.

6
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,284
Get home safely.

7
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,330
Hey, you're home.

8
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:01,388
Yes.

9
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,790
I'm going to take out the trash.

10
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,092
Okay.

11
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,846
What? Why are you back?

12
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,748
Do you have soju?

13
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,709
Did something happen?

14
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:42,896
Is it because of that girl you like?

15
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,314
Gosh, your first love is
really giving you a hard time.

16
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,389
But then again, everyone becomes
a fool for their first love.

17
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,816
You just end up liking a great person...

18
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,780
...instead of liking the person that
has a chance of ending up with you.

19
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,882
How can anyone differentiate that?

20
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,483
It's hard at first.

21
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:07,587
But once you get heartbroken
a couple of times,

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,955
you start having better judgment.

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,590
You're able to stop yourself...

24
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,081
from liking the person that
you don't have a chance with.

25
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:17,847
You'll continuously stop yourself
from thinking of that person.

26
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,053
Are you sleeping already?

27
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,547
Are you sick?

28
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,847
Good luck with Kyung Seok.

29
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:35,048
I thought no one would ever root for me.

30
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:49,074
I need to go home now.

31
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,880
Let me stay here tonight.

32
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,262
Hey, do you think I'm still
the owner of this place?

33
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,735
Fine, do whatever you want.

34
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,237
I'll come in early tomorrow morning.

35
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:10,410
See you.

36
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,758
Did he leave already?

37
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,314
Or did he not come home?

38
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:00,481
- Hey, Soo A.
- Hey.

39
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,811
Let me take a photo of
you wearing a lab coat.

40
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,998
Why only me?

41
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,781
You should take a photo
of Dong Won as well.

42
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,669
Let me take a photo of you first.

43
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,071
Here we go.

44
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,576
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

45
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,980
How much did you drink?
You normally drink really well.

46
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,084
I guess everyone reeks of
alcohol if they drink too much.

47
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,785
It's quite humane.

48
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,789
Is there something wrong?

49
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,363
If you're too tired, you can take
some rest at the medical office.

50
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,565
I'll explain to the assistant manager.

51
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,334
Thanks.

52
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,986
You can rest here.

53
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,388
Okay.

54
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,477
(Woo Young)

55
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,663
Why didn't Tae Hee come today?

56
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,658
I don't know. She won't pick up my calls.

57
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:48,197
Someone should check up on Kyung Seok.

58
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:50,401
Shouldn't he have some soup?

59
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:53,547
Just let him rest.
He'll sober up after a while.

60
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,842
But I'm sure he'll feel
sick until he sobers up.

61
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,345
He should've just stayed home.

62
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,448
If you're so worried, why don't
you go check up on him yourself?

63
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,218
Do you know where the medical office is?

64
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:07,020
Are you really going to go?

65
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,123
Do you like Kyung Seok?

66
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,624
What?

67
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,148
Gosh, I was just joking.

68
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,733
Are you angry?

69
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,938
No.

70
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,240
It seems like you really like him.

71
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,247
You're right.

72
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,549
I like Kyung Seok.

73
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,556
You said you didn't like him
when I asked at the festival.

74
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,859
I know.

75
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,261
Are you guys dating?

76
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,248
See? I knew this would happen.

77
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,766
They're dating for sure.

78
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,981
No, we're not dating yet.

79
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,389
Are you okay?

80
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,759
Soo A is so weird.

81
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,362
She told us that she doesn't
have high standards.

82
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,831
But did you see how she confessed
that she likes Kyung Seok?

83
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:26,933
What a joke.

84
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:30,537
To be honest, it's not like Kyung Seok
has a good personality.

85
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,706
Soo A is just the same.
She likes good-looking guys.

86
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,079
Hey.

87
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,414
You already got rejected
at the welcome party.

88
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,814
Stop making a fuss about it.

89
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,418
I know that.

90
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,247
But she didn't have to tell me
that she likes someone else.

91
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,429
Yes, I guess.

92
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,432
It just means...

93
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,613
...that she totally made a fool of me.

94
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,709
About the girl that I like...

95
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,815
Apparently, she likes someone else.

96
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,715
This makes no sense.

97
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:18,180
She made it seem like
she liked me as well.

98
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,287
Was she just having fun with me?

99
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,691
I'm so angry.

100
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,197
Ms. Na.

101
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,203
What's wrong?

102
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,306
Ms. Yoon just came by...

103
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,981
...and told me that Kyung Seok is
in the medical office right now.

104
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:45,278
What?

105
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,179
Is he sick?

106
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,781
Not exactly.

107
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,683
He's hungover.

108
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,881
I think he drank too much.

109
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:11,314
Are you okay?

110
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,413
What happened?

111
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,015
Is there something wrong?

112
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,118
No.

113
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,921
Then why did you drink so much...

114
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,622
...that you even had to come here?

115
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:33,026
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:38,014
Is there really nothing
I should be worried about?

117
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:40,914
Everything's fine.

118
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:44,837
How much did you drink?

119
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,042
I don't know. I think
I drank about 5 to 6 bottles.

120
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:50,143
No,

121
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,146
-seven bottles.
-What?

122
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,248
Do you want to die?

123
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,619
Well...

124
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,347
Sorry, that was too mean.

125
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,698
You shouldn't drink that much.

126
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,199
Don't ever do it again.

127
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,480
You really...

128
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,781
...can't smell, can you?

129
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,282
Everyone else has avoided me
because I reek of alcohol.

130
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,653
Don't think your mom is
an excuse for everything.

131
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,247
No one will go easy on you
even if you're the CEO's son.

132
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,747
If you do this again,

133
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,959
I'll kick you out from the team.

134
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:41,861
Okay.

135
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,632
Did you treat your hangover?

136
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,536
- No.
- Gosh.

137
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,939
Whom do you take after to
drink so much like this?

138
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,246
Why would you smile? You did nothing good.

139
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,248
It didn't feel real,

140
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,448
but now, I feel like I really have a mom.

141
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:17,730
Stay here. I'll go get
you some honey water.

142
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,274
Why don't you go visit
him in the infirmary?

143
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,481
I might wake him up.

144
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,980
- Who cares?
- It could be irritating.

145
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,113
No one will be irritated
when you visit them.

146
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,422
Just go in there,

147
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,223
and ask him, "Kyung Seok, are you okay?"

148
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,814
Then he'll answer, "Soo A, you're here."

149
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,127
That's how you'll go out with him.

150
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:49,229
Go already.

151
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:50,530
What's going on?

152
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:52,932
She only said she had a crush on him,

153
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:55,735
but it feels like they've already
become an official couple.

154
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,071
I'd go if I were you.

155
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,375
- You really should.
- It's hard to understand.

156
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:03,976
What?

157
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,045
Nothing.

158
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,348
(Woo Young)

159
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,557
Hello?

160
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:20,159
- We should go too.
- Should we?

161
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,366
Tae Hee.

162
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,769
What's wrong? What happened?

163
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,381
What is wrong?

164
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,480
I broke up with my boyfriend.

165
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,579
What?

166
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,849
Stop crying for now.

167
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,152
Stop crying.

168
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,647
Don't cry.

169
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,163
Yes, Kyung Seok is here. Why do you ask?

170
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,032
He wasn't home in the morning, so I
was wondering if he never came home.

171
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,235
He didn't go home yesterday?

172
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,238
No. Well, I'm relieved
to hear that he's there.

173
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,641
You're okay, right?

174
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:13,646
Yes.

175
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,817
I'll hang up then.

176
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:19,118
Bye.

177
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,829
I'm not okay.

178
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,914
All of a sudden over the phone?

179
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,748
Why?

180
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,942
We had an argument because of Chan Woo.

181
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,347
But that can't be the reason to break up.

182
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,147
Maybe he has another reason.

183
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,651
Did he feel ashamed to be
with a fatty girlfriend too?

184
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:53,953
Hey, what are you saying?

185
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,256
I can't believe that's the only reason.

186
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,948
Did her boyfriend dump her?

187
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,362
Is that why she cried?

188
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,163
People say it's fine as long
as you love each other,

189
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,463
but I guess you can't
ignore what others say.

190
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:12,972
Right, a lot of them said
Tae Young was too good...

191
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,680
for the chubby girl like her.

192
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:18,277
I don't know why people gossip
about others' love affairs.

193
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,345
Goodness.

194
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,616
I know.

195
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,114
- Go in.
- Okay.

196
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,514
Cheer up, Tae Young.

197
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,149
Remember I'm always on your side.

198
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,413
You always brush your teeth
right after having a meal.

199
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:24,010
It's become a habit of mine. I feel
uncomfortable when I don't do it.

200
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,378
I'll be back.

201
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:38,257
Did you hear?

202
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,547
Tae Young and Tae Hee broke up.

203
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:44,830
- What?
- Everyone talked about...

204
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,747
...how she didn't deserve him.

205
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,834
It must've been stressful.

206
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,238
I'm worried too.

207
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:55,741
People might say I don't deserve
Kyung Seok if we go out.

208
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,648
Kyung Seok doesn't like you.

209
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,468
Some men do this.

210
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,548
They date girls because they like them,

211
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,680
but they also want to show them off.

212
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,280
- Excuse me.
- Thanks for that day.

213
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,233
Things were awkward between
me and Kyung Seok,

214
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,436
but you walked away as
if you didn't see us.

215
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:40,620
Soo A, you know about everything,

216
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:43,322
so why are you doing this to me?

217
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,804
Since when were you there?

218
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,372
Did you...

219
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:36,075
...throw up?

220
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,276
What?

221
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,879
It sounded like you did.

222
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,914
I felt sick.

223
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,181
I gagged a little, but I didn't throw up.

224
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:58,798
What is it?

225
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,500
I saw you earlier during lunch,

226
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,336
and you didn't look like
you were feeling sick.

227
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:06,906
What?

228
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,514
Don't tell me...

229
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,615
...you habitually throw up after eating.

230
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:24,146
That's ridiculous. Why would I do that?

231
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,559
Do you see me as a person
who'd do such a thing?

232
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,876
She's flustered.

233
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,781
She obviously is flustered.

234
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:44,346
You woke up.

235
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:48,581
I was told to come check your condition.

236
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,652
How many bottles does a heavy
drinker like you need...

237
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,755
...to become that drunk?

238
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,161
Do I still reek of alcohol?

239
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,432
You do.

240
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,468
Still, it's gotten
better than a while ago.

241
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,974
What's that?

242
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,245
Is that honey water? Who made you that?

243
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,381
Did Soo A come see you?

244
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:24,383
Why would she come here?

245
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,688
We had a crazy incident
during lunch earlier.

246
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,991
We were having lunch together,

247
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,582
and Soo A announced that she likes you.

248
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,163
What?

249
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,065
Kyung Seok, you're unbelievable...

250
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,283
...for making a girl like
her have a crush on you.

251
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:44,714
I'm so jealous.

252
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,614
You had no idea?

253
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,711
Is she out of her mind?

254
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,513
Gosh, hey.

255
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,118
Hey, Kyung Seok. Do Kyung Seok!

256
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:12,598
I've done it too, even though
it was only for a short while.

257
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,972
I've always been too skinny,
and I never liked it.

258
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:25,110
Why? Why did she lie that
she never puts on weight?

259
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:27,513
That pretty friend of yours...

260
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,983
...may not be much different from you.

261
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,521
Even with that pretty face,

262
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,923
you're unhappy?

263
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:42,228
Hey, Kyung Seok.

264
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,348
Kyung Seok, Do Kyung Seok!

265
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:49,902
Are you feeling better now?

266
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,874
We need to talk.

267
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,476
Oh, okay. I'll see you in a bit.

268
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,848
Tae Young, where are you?

269
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,184
Do you want to grab a drink with me later?

270
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,686
A drink, not food?

271
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,388
Yes.

272
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,491
What's gotten into you? You rarely drink.

273
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,194
I know, right?

274
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,497
I'm surprised that I'm craving alcohol.

275
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,100
All right, bring other guys too.
I'll treat you all.

276
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,004
Okay. I'll see you there, then. All right.

277
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,380
Those who aren't here today
and those who were late.

278
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,281
If you're late again or
miss another experiment,

279
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,712
you won't be able to get your certificate.

280
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,110
Where shall we go to talk?

281
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,897
We don't need to go anywhere.
Let's just talk here.

282
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,399
Here?

283
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,375
Guys, shall we leave? Let's go.

284
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,680
Come on. Let's go.

285
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,877
Mi Rae, let's go.

286
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,507
Kyung Seok is so manly.

287
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,697
He should still take her
to somewhere romantic.

288
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,080
Manly? I don't think so. He seemed angry.

289
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,370
No way. What's there to be angry about?

290
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,372
I mean, Soo A likes him.

291
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,575
I'm telling you.
They'll start dating today.

292
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,581
I told you to stop.

293
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:16,782
Stop what?

294
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,048
I heard you told everyone
that you like me.

295
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:21,947
You're really something.

296
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,257
I've never hated anyone this much.

297
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:28,127
Why are you so cold to me?

298
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,928
Just because you don't like me...

299
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,247
...doesn't mean you should doubt
me when I say I like you.

300
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:38,437
I pity you.

301
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,540
All right, fine.

302
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,810
I never knew having a crush
on someone was this hard.

303
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,814
This is really exhausting.

304
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,914
That's not what I meant.

305
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:53,581
I pity you as a person.

306
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,422
What?

307
00:25:56,814 --> 00:25:58,690
If I date someone else,

308
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,927
will it ruin your reputation of
being the most popular girl?

309
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:14,139
Kyung Seok will reject her.

310
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:17,142
But it'll only distance me
further away from him.

311
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,647
Everyone will think that he'll date
someone who's prettier than Soo A.

312
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,148
They'll have high expectations.

313
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,453
Soo A can't date Kyung Seok,

314
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,756
and he doesn't like her.

315
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,459
I'm sure she knows too.

316
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,362
Then why did she tell everyone
that she has a crush on him?

317
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,132
Some men do this.

318
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:43,135
They date girls because they like them,

319
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,437
but they also want to show them off.

320
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,348
Soo A does not like Kyung Seok.

321
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,621
Then just like how you told everyone
about having a crush on me,

322
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:05,190
shall I go ahead and tell
everyone whom I like?

323
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,428
Shall I tell people that I like Mi Rae?

324
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,331
Well, if you do that,

325
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,634
Mi Rae will become so famous.

326
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,440
People will wonder why a guy
like you has fallen for Mi Rae.

327
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,144
Do you think all the gossip
and rumors will benefit her?

328
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,257
Mi Rae.

329
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:45,130
Kyung Seok, let's go.

330
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:56,341
Well, we're talking about
something important now.

331
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:59,044
I also have to talk to him
about something important.

332
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,146
What do you think you're doing now?

333
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,915
Soo A.

334
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,450
What do you think you're doing now?

335
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,119
I'll talk to her.

336
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,424
Let me talk to Soo A for a minute.

337
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,013
I know that you don't like me.

338
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,416
I also know you can't stand the fact...

339
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,518
...that Kyung Seok likes me.

340
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,987
But...

341
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,189
...you'd better not use him.

342
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:48,794
Do not meddle in his life.

343
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,164
I'm meddling in his life?

344
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,747
What are you talking about?

345
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,847
Everyone knows that he's the
most handsome, competent guy.

346
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,640
If he dates someone else, you won't
be in the spotlight anymore.

347
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:04,422
That's why you're trying to make sure...

348
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:06,745
...he can't date anyone if he's
not going to go out with you.

349
00:29:11,113 --> 00:29:12,818
Are you in your right mind now?

350
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,119
Yes.

351
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,514
I've come to my senses.

352
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:21,526
I can see exactly what
you're trying to do.

353
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:23,495
Even with Chan Woo,

354
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:27,332
I bet you told him you can't
date him because I like him.

355
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,836
And I also know that you
approached Park Yong Chul first.

356
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:34,439
You must've wanted to make me
admit that I was born ugly.

357
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:36,942
That I'm no match for you.

358
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:45,077
That's right.

359
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,487
From the moment I was born,

360
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,523
and for the rest of my life,
I'll be different from you.

361
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:56,428
I'm different from girls who want to
fix their faces for a better life.

362
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,233
I'm not sure about that.

363
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:07,739
I think we're a bit similar in some ways.

364
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,308
What?

365
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,513
Are you being like this
because of what you saw?

366
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,917
Let me make it clear to you again.
I wasn't forcing myself to throw up.

367
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:21,420
I was just nauseated, that's all.

368
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,224
The fact that you're bringing it up now...

369
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,130
...tells me that you were in fact
forcing yourself to throw up.

370
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:34,933
Hey!

371
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,481
I've never seen you like this before.

372
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,115
Do you know...

373
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,248
...that this is your first
time being honest with me?

374
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,547
I think it's my first time...

375
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:00,647
...seeing the real you.

376
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,014
That brat.

377
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,542
She should know her place.

378
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:40,232
What was it?

379
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:46,004
- What do you mean?
- You said you wanted to talk to me.

380
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,207
What was it that you wanted to say?

381
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:51,943
Well...

382
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:53,681
The things is...

383
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,850
Are you sober now?

384
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:03,981
I'm so disappointed.

385
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,159
Is that the important thing
you had to say to me?

386
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,728
Yes.

387
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,034
I was worried about you.

388
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:28,980
Do you want to eat?

389
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,982
What?

390
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,168
(Gangnam beauty)

391
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,679
You're home early.

392
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,748
I'm going to rest for a while.

393
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:06,263
I don't feel like dealing with customers.

394
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:08,753
- Did you eat?
- No.

395
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,647
I bought you some dumplings.
You should have some.

396
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,159
I don't feel like eating anything.

397
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:16,962
My gosh, stop acting like someone died.

398
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,680
What's wrong with you?

399
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:23,547
It's all my fault.

400
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:26,553
I told her to get a full makeover.

401
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:29,941
She should've just gotten a few surgeries.

402
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,043
What's the use of saying that now?

403
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,945
Here. Let's eat.

404
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,714
Do you think...

405
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:42,354
...people say that to her face?

406
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,657
They're probably just saying
that behind her back, right?

407
00:33:50,547 --> 00:33:53,547
I feel so sorry for her.

408
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:56,368
Gosh, I told you to stop
acting like someone died.

409
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,836
Why are you crying?

410
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,239
I feel apologetic toward you too.

411
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:04,442
There are a lot of people
who like Mi Rae as well.

412
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:07,445
She seemed really popular
at the orientation.

413
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,547
Right?

414
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,147
There has to be more people
that like her, right?

415
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,653
Of course. People who call her names
are the ones who don't know her.

416
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,455
The ones who know her well
wouldn't call her that.

417
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:19,558
Eat up.

418
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,761
Yes, you're right.

419
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:32,170
Were you really going to
ask if I was sober or not?

420
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,173
What?

421
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:38,081
Well, that and...

422
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,047
Why didn't you go home last night?

423
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:44,950
How did you know?

424
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,352
Woo Young called me earlier.

425
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,955
He told me that you didn't come home
and asked if you came to the lab.

426
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:52,557
I didn't go home because
I didn't want to see him.

427
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,758
Why?

428
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,464
Did you fight with him?

429
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:02,463
I would if it was
something worth fighting.

430
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:06,037
If it wasn't worth fighting, then
why don't you want to see him?

431
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:14,546
That's weird. He's a nice guy.

432
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,847
Okay, fine.

433
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,247
- I don't want it.
- Okay, I get it.

434
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,025
Woo Young, is there a something wrong?

435
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,213
No, there's nothing wrong.

436
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,514
You bought us food a lot of times,

437
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,132
but it's your first time buying us drinks.

438
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,403
This is so fun. Let's clink glasses.

439
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:39,896
Come on. Cheers.

440
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,614
Cheers.

441
00:35:41,913 --> 00:35:43,008
Cheers.

442
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,015
Gosh.

443
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:54,719
Are you guys dating anyone?

444
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,713
He's dating Tae Hee.

445
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,524
And we're not dating anyone as usual.

446
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,229
Did I ask you to come when
you have to meet Tae Hee?

447
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,731
No, we don't meet that often.

448
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,928
Why? You just started dating.

449
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:11,045
Don't couples normally meet
each other every day at first?

450
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:13,538
Then why do you always
get dumped so quickly?

451
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,407
Hey, don't say that.
I've dumped someone as well.

452
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,014
When? I don't ever recall that happening.

453
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,814
My gosh, you don't know me.

454
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,215
Then tell me. Who did you dump?

455
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,716
- Min Jung.
- Oh, come on.

456
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,625
- My gosh.
- Who's Min Jung?

457
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,922
The pretty girl in the biology department.

458
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,547
That's absurd. Why did you dump her?

459
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:38,063
Well, she's pretty,
but she's not very curvy.

460
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:39,948
- My gosh.
- He's lying.

461
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:41,332
I'm not lying.

462
00:36:41,447 --> 00:36:43,334
Do you want me to call Min Jung?

463
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,147
- Yes. I'll call her.
- Fine.

464
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,838
Where's my phone?

465
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:48,740
Why did you...

466
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,343
...suddenly show up at the lab
when Soo A and I were talking?

467
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,445
What?

468
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:56,548
You could've asked if I was sober
after I was done talking to her.

469
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:00,085
You're right.

470
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,188
I guess I'm really impatient.

471
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,956
Was it because...

472
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,160
...you were worried that something
might happen between me and her?

473
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,480
No.

474
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,780
I already know that you don't like Soo A.

475
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,643
- Are you done eating?
- Yes.

476
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:36,020
To be honest, I went there because
I didn't want anyone bothering you.

477
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,224
I didn't want her to anger the guy I like.

478
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,325
Aren't you coming?

479
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:43,328
Okay, I'm going.

480
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,858
I've never seen you like this before.

481
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,281
I think it's my first time...

482
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,065
...seeing the real you.

483
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:03,575
I tried so hard.

484
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,655
- Hello?
- Hey, Soo A.

485
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:37,848
It's me, Tae Young.

486
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,180
Hello?

487
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,850
Yes.

488
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:48,853
I...

489
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,956
...had a couple drinks.

490
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,259
I'm busy right now.

491
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,729
Soo A.

492
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:20,184
My gosh.

493
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,500
- Let's put him over there.
- Okay.

494
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,691
My goodness.

495
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:31,896
You're the guy he lives with?

496
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,899
- Let's go, I'm about to pass out.
- Okay.

497
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,101
Please take care of him.

498
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:40,113
He's acting strange today.
I'm sure he's up with something.

499
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,940
- Right.
- I can tell.

500
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:51,015
Woo Young.

501
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,419
Wake up.

502
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,422
It's you, Kyung Seok.

503
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,530
Sleep in your bed.

504
00:40:58,614 --> 00:41:00,641
Okay, I will.

505
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,560
I won't sleep out.

506
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,661
You're home.

507
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,863
Okay, I will go.

508
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,515
Sit up first.

509
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,340
Gosh, why...

510
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,744
It's you, Kyung Seok.

511
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:23,648
I need to brush my teeth
before going to bed.

512
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,661
Gosh, take it easy.

513
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:49,640
Here.

514
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,743
Thanks.

515
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,956
Thanks.

516
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:17,635
Gosh, I almost threw up.

517
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,138
My gosh.

518
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:22,340
This tastes weird.

519
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,775
Give me that.

520
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:32,717
Open up.

521
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,120
It's all over his face.

522
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:42,114
This is it.

523
00:42:42,313 --> 00:42:44,780
Please brush the other side too.

524
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,414
There, there.

525
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:49,181
Open up wide.

526
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:54,906
I can't believe I'm doing this.

527
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,313
Thanks.

528
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:15,161
It's tougher than I thought.

529
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:17,380
So why did you drink more
than you can handle?

530
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,267
I got rejected by Mi Rae.

531
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,075
What did you just say?

532
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:34,779
Woo Young.

533
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,780
Woo Young. Woo Young.

534
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,865
Mi Rae.

535
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,366
Yes?

536
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,069
Aren't we going to go on blind dates?

537
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,280
Why do you ask?

538
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,941
I thought I'd have a cool
boyfriend when I entered college.

539
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,543
But nothing is happening.

540
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,247
(Kyung Seok)

541
00:44:19,747 --> 00:44:21,047
Hello?

542
00:44:21,144 --> 00:44:22,520
Come out for a second.

543
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,028
Now?

544
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:25,930
Yes.

545
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,132
It's not something to talk about tomorrow.

546
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,247
Anyway, come out now.

547
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,137
Okay.

548
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,892
Go ahead and ask what you have to.

549
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,115
What did you do with Woo Young yesterday?

550
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,439
Why do I have to tell you that?

551
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:44,308
I heard you rejected him.

552
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:47,443
- Is that right?
- Who told you that?

553
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:48,813
Did Woo Young say that to you?

554
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:50,514
Yes.

555
00:45:52,946 --> 00:45:55,219
I didn't think he'd be
that kind of a person,

556
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,154
but he's such a big mouth.

557
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:05,429
By the way,

558
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,599
did you call me out to ask me that?

559
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,707
Yes.

560
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:28,753
Shall we go?

561
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,798
Aren't you going to go?

562
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,402
I'll tell you why I turned him down.

563
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,215
I have someone I like.

564
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:56,714
I...

565
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:02,420
...like you.

566
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,097
I like you.

567
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:51,402
I know it's shameless of me...

568
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,941
...to say this after rejecting you twice.

569
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,642
It's fine.

570
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:04,548
I told you I'd wait.

571
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,617
So now, we're...

572
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:27,905
We're going out, right?

573
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,613
- What?
- No?

574
00:48:31,113 --> 00:48:34,445
Yes, right.

575
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:52,787
Shall we go now?

576
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:27,097
It's pretty much the same.

577
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,799
Right?

578
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,504
Shall we hold hands, then?

579
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:39,910
Well...

580
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,713
We could.

581
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:15,679
We're already here.

582
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,781
I know.

583
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:26,498
I should let go of your hand now.

584
00:50:42,046 --> 00:50:44,513
Thanks. Get home safely.

585
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,244
All right. Go in.

586
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:48,746
Okay.

587
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:55,486
Bye. Get home safely.

588
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,279
- Hey, you're back.
- Yes.

589
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,081
Why did he want to see you?
Was it about something urgent?

590
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,819
No, nothing urgent.

591
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,681
Hey, do you...

592
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,293
...still have a crush on Kyung Seok?

593
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:37,695
What?

594
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:41,699
I mean, feelings can change.

595
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,502
You may fall for someone else, you know.

596
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,480
Someone else? Gosh, what
are you talking about?

597
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,980
No.

598
00:51:58,486 --> 00:52:02,286
Both you and I need to fall for
guys who will like us back.

599
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,233
Did something happen yesterday?

600
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,348
You drank a lot last night.
Have some of this.

601
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:27,062
And make sure you take
this before you drink.

602
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:28,872
(No More Hangovers)

603
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,780
- Hey, what's gotten into you?
- Why?

604
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,454
I must've made a drunken mistake.

605
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,355
Are you being all nice to me...

606
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,357
...because you're going to move out?

607
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:49,259
Why would I move out?

608
00:53:57,046 --> 00:53:59,313
- Did you make this?
- Yes.

609
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:00,904
You're a pretty good cook.

610
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:02,840
You can find all sorts of recipes online.

611
00:54:03,147 --> 00:54:04,241
Right.

612
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:09,346
- I did make a mistake, didn't I?
- You did.

613
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,918
Don't tell me that I...
I didn't cry, right?

614
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,756
I think you did tear up a little.

615
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:21,658
Did I actually cry?

616
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,261
If you jab the back of your throat
with a toothbrush like this,

617
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,463
you could tear up.

618
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,034
I'm glad I brushed my
teeth before I crashed.

619
00:54:44,253 --> 00:54:46,650
I told Mi Rae how I feel about her,
but she rejected me.

620
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:49,553
I thought that she'd at least
think about it,

621
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,555
but she said no right away.

622
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,494
I know that you have feelings for her too.

623
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,363
Good luck.

624
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,501
I'm trying.

625
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,070
You'll have to make a lot of effort.

626
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:11,074
Mi Rae is quite reserved...

627
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:14,178
and cautious, so it won't be easy.

628
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,682
Don't tell her about me
getting drunk last night.

629
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,217
She'll feel bad.

630
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,988
Did you like her a lot?

631
00:55:28,514 --> 00:55:31,628
Yes, I guess so. More than I realized.

632
00:55:48,934 --> 00:55:50,247
Am I dreaming now?

633
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:57,581
(Kyung Seok)

634
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,089
Are you up yet?

635
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,392
No, this isn't a dream.

636
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,765
(Are you up yet?)

637
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,369
(Yes.)

638
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,937
Let's go to the lab together.

639
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:19,643
- What are you doing?
- What?

640
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,246
Did you hear some bad news or what?

641
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:23,547
No.

642
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,052
I have to get ready.

643
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,734
What's with her?

644
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:50,274
Should I have done a
facial mask last night?

645
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,379
Why is my face so puffy today?

646
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:45,996
- Hi.
- Hi.

647
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,800
- Did you have a good sleep?
- Yes. What about you?

648
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,301
I did too.

649
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:57,007
This sounds like a conversation
in an English textbook.

650
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:58,207
What do you mean?

651
00:57:58,913 --> 00:58:00,510
Good morning, how are you?

652
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,512
I'm fine. And you?

653
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,585
Oh, the bus is here.

654
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:18,895
Go ahead.

655
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:21,898
Okay.

656
00:58:31,603 --> 00:58:33,003
Did you...

657
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:34,911
...have breakfast?

658
00:58:35,313 --> 00:58:38,315
No, I just had a glass of water.

659
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,084
Do you usually skip breakfast?

660
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:45,589
Well, you know. I eat breakfast sometimes.

661
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,547
What about you?

662
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:51,061
I had breakfast with Woo Young.

663
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,234
- Did you tell him?
- Tell him what?

664
00:58:57,347 --> 00:59:01,338
Did you tell Woo Young that
we're seeing each other now?

665
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,441
No, not yet.

666
00:59:05,147 --> 00:59:06,410
I see.

667
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,413
Shall I tell him?

668
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:14,818
No, if he finds out that
I started seeing you right away...

669
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:16,920
Do you feel bad?

670
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:19,523
Yes, a little.

671
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,514
I guess you're...

672
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,081
...worried about Woo Young.

673
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,864
No, I'm not.

674
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:32,235
It's just that he was the first
person who rooted for us.

675
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:35,539
Who? Woo Young?

676
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,840
Yes.

677
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,509
He wished me good luck with you.

678
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,282
I guess I made it pretty obvious
that I like you.

679
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:48,914
He deserved to get his teeth brushed.

680
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,314
What?

681
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,022
Nothing.

682
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,527
By the way,

683
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,033
I'd prefer not to tell people.

684
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,534
Why?

685
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,437
Are you scared they might say something?

686
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,039
Yes.

687
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,641
I must sound so dumb now.

688
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,947
If anyone says anything,
I won't let it slide.

689
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,053
Do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter to me.

690
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,081
But no one on this bus knows us.

691
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:37,767
What?

692
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:51,114
Forget it if you don't want to.

693
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,617
No, I want to.

694
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:24,981
Let's stay like this until we get off.

695
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:27,684
Okay.

696
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,433
Are they coming together?

697
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:46,036
You mean Kyung Seok and Soo A?

698
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,137
Yes.

699
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:49,372
But Kyung Seok was quite upset yesterday.

700
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,674
He seemed a bit angry.

701
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:52,075
Haven't you watched any romantic comedies?

702
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,088
Bickering can make the heart grow fonder.

703
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,711
That's true. I wonder why we're
still not fond of each other.

704
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,915
Oh, what happened yesterday?

705
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:01,117
- With what?
- With Kyung Seok.

706
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,677
Drum rolls.

707
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,657
I think he likes someone else.

708
01:02:07,778 --> 01:02:08,895
What?

709
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:15,760
Hey, where are you now?

710
01:02:15,844 --> 01:02:16,860
I'm almost there.

711
01:02:16,944 --> 01:02:19,436
I have big news for you.

712
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:21,238
What is it?

713
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,245
He rejected Soo A.

714
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:27,477
That serves her right.

715
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,577
Apparently, Kyung Seok likes someone else.

716
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:31,548
Gosh, who could it be?

717
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,278
She must be prettier than Soo A, so
it can't be someone at our school.

718
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:37,170
- Hey.
- What?

719
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,289
Soo A isn't that pretty.

720
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,877
Goodness gracious.

721
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,978
You should've given up
like that a long ago.

722
01:02:49,078 --> 01:02:50,478
Who could it be?

723
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:54,471
Are you going to keep it
from Hyun Jung too?

724
01:02:55,177 --> 01:02:58,708
No, I should tell her.

725
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,383
You go in first. I'll go in a bit later.

726
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:09,219
No, I'll go in later. You go ahead.

727
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,410
No, you go in first.

728
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:13,490
No, you go ahead. It's really okay.

729
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:14,691
What are you guys doing?

730
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:18,478
Hey, Eun.

731
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:20,979
What are you two doing here?

732
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,167
We just ran into each other here.

733
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,268
What?

734
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,908
That answer didn't even make any sense.

735
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,211
I'll head in first.

736
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,520
Did Kyung Seok...

737
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,022
...tell you what happened
with Soo A yesterday?

738
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:46,890
Sorry?

739
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,394
I don't think their talk went well.

740
01:03:52,544 --> 01:03:54,297
I knew it.

741
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:55,485
How?

742
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:58,268
I think he has feelings for you.

743
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:59,402
What?

744
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:04,607
Gosh, Eun. What on earth
are you talking about?

745
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,678
You said Jung Boon is taking
a summer class, right?

746
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:12,415
Yes, let's visit her at school soon.

747
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,518
My gosh, I miss Jung Boon.

748
01:04:17,078 --> 01:04:18,788
I feel bad for Soo A.

749
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,224
She should've just kept it to herself.

750
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:25,412
Hey, why didn't you feel bad for me?

751
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:29,232
Everyone knew I had a crush on Kyung Seok.
I was so embarrassed.

752
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,635
Because you were hitting
on him left and right.

753
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,037
What?

754
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,639
What the...

755
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:39,109
Hey, Tae Hee.

756
01:04:48,197 --> 01:04:49,586
Kyung Seok.

757
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:07,604
Shouldn't we finish our
conversation from yesterday?

758
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:10,306
I told you everything I had to say.

759
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,711
I've told everyone...

760
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,612
...that you rejected me.

761
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:21,918
- Eun.
- Yes?

762
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:25,811
I have to use the restroom quickly.

763
01:05:25,911 --> 01:05:28,011
- Okay.
- All right.

764
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,732
I won't be like that again.

765
01:05:36,377 --> 01:05:38,611
I'm sorry if I annoyed you.

766
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,239
We'll have to see each other at school,

767
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:46,509
so we'll both be uncomfortable
if we're on bad terms.

768
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,611
Let's at least say hi to each other.

769
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,412
If you behave yourself.

770
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:55,051
You're so cold to me.

771
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,522
So are you and Mi Rae
seeing each other now?

772
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,011
Are you two dating?

773
01:06:07,145 --> 01:06:08,479
Yes.

774
01:06:14,511 --> 01:06:15,738
We're seeing each other now.

775
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,363
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

776
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,965
You've gotten so brave, Mi Rae.

777
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:43,166
How dare you.

778
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,501
I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

779
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:47,337
We won't run into people from
our department here, right?

780
01:06:47,444 --> 01:06:50,106
It looked like Tae Young was
confessing his feelings to her.

781
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:52,408
Is there something you
want to talk to me about?

782
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,810
Hey, isn't this Soo A?

783
01:06:53,911 --> 01:06:54,811
What is this?

784
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,080
I happened to see it
while surfing the web.

785
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,314
Who took the photos?

786
01:06:58,414 --> 01:06:59,983
You'll hide it from people
in your department?

787
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,385
"Whom is he seeing after rejecting Soo A?"

788
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,786
If people find out that it's me...

789
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:05,204
Don't feel bad for me.

790
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,192
That's what Soo A wants.
