1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,347
Is your stomach okay?

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,447
Yes, I think I feel better now.

3
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,213
Don't worry. You didn't
make any drunken mistakes.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,480
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:26,056
- I heard you carried me home.
- What about it?

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,747
I'm sorry for the trouble.

7
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:33,825
Don't ever drink more than three shots
when I'm not around.

8
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:35,981
What?

9
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:40,014
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,915
What does he mean by that?

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,484
I shouldn't let any other
guy carry me home?

12
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:00,847
Aren't you taking this bus?

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,613
Oh, yes. I'm coming.

14
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:25,514
Hello.

15
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:28,014
- How have you been?
- Good.

16
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,189
Who is he?

17
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:33,647
Once, I thought Mi Rae was a
celebrity and followed her.

18
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,262
You even remember my name?

19
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:37,164
I remember because you're so pretty.

20
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,433
You probably don't remember my name.

21
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,069
- Your name?
- I'm Kim Se Hoon.

22
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:43,948
Right, Se Hoon.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,047
Mi Rae, are you on social media?
Let's follow each other.

24
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:50,015
I don't do those things.

25
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,448
You should remember my name too.

26
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,582
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

27
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,452
Are you her boyfriend?

28
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,853
- Yes.
- No.

29
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,256
You're Mi Rae's boyfriend?

30
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,458
- No.
- Yes.

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,750
This is my stop. Have a good day.

32
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:17,346
Bye.

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,409
Why did you lie to him?

34
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:23,944
When did I lie?

35
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,047
I am a boy, not a girl.
It's not like I'm your girl friend.

36
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,717
It's a good tactic to ward off...

37
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:32,853
...those who bug you.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,692
Why is he being like this?
He's leading me on.

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,721
Her.

40
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,023
Do you like him?

41
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:12,726
Do you?

42
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,230
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

43
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,010
Hey.

44
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,047
Do you have feelings for me?

45
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,467
Stay focused, please.

46
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:55,836
Okay.

47
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,138
This is the last experiment
of the semester.

48
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,730
Stay focused until the end of the class...

49
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,908
...and be sure to submit your
report by the end of the day.

50
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,944
- Got it.
- Okay.

51
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:12,696
What's wrong?

52
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,582
I don't have last week's report.

53
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,689
What?

54
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,092
I'm sure you have it with you.
Try looking again.

55
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,560
It's not here.

56
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,647
What should I do?

57
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,862
What's wrong with you today?

58
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,363
All our grades depend on that report.

59
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,669
And you're saying you lost it?

60
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,671
What are we going to do?

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,675
Should we just make it up?

62
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:38,145
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,747
My gosh.

64
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:44,951
Let's look for it again.

65
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:19,812
(The recrystallization of acetanilide)

66
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,676
(The heating time of benzoic
acid and acetanilide)

67
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,724
Yes, it was 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

68
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,214
Yes, it was 2g. I remember now.

69
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:33,834
My goodness.

70
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,938
He's not only good looking,
but he's a genius as well.

71
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,913
This is all we need, right?

72
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,114
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,183
Thanks.

74
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,887
Soo A, you should treat
Kyung Seok to a meal.

75
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,388
Of course.

76
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:06,591
I'll go now.

77
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:07,964
I'll go with you.

78
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:13,181
Bye, Kyung Seok.

79
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,154
I was really startled
because of the report.

80
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,263
I'll treat you to a meal later.

81
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,669
No, it's okay.

82
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:27,888
I'll just get you something
at the school cafeteria.

83
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,690
At least let me buy you that.

84
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,693
We really picked a great team leader.

85
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,395
Well, that's not really true.

86
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,182
He only volunteered to do it
because no one else wanted to.

87
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,886
Imagine how it is if you were
the team leader.

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,196
What's wrong with me?
Am I jealous right now?

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,005
My gosh.

90
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,977
I was really upset after
you left yesterday.

91
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,215
I just wanted to help you out
because I figured...

92
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,416
...you and I come from
a similar background.

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,419
Plus, we both moved out and
are living by ourselves now.

94
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,014
I thought both your parents passed away.

95
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,825
Why bother moving out?

96
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,063
My grandma nags a lot.

97
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:12,065
Do you feel better?

98
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,467
I know a restaurant that sells
great hangover noodles.

99
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,269
Just a second.

100
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,371
We came to hand in our team's report.

101
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,773
You can leave it on my desk.

102
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:20,974
Okay.

103
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,077
Sorry. They also sell a lot of
other delicious menus as well.

104
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,680
It's on me. Let's go eat there.

105
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,480
The next person in line can come in.

106
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,559
It's really delicious.

107
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,162
I'm glad you like it. Eat up.

108
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,264
Thank you.

109
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,970
How are things going with
your fragrant candles?

110
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,480
I was planning on selling
fragrant candles,

111
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:56,371
but it's not that easy, so I'm just
going to get another part-time job.

112
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:03,350
Cheer up.

113
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,120
Thank you.

114
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,624
You should've added your photo.

115
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,614
Your appearance plays a big part
when you're job searching.

116
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:16,830
You should know after the
interview you did yesterday.

117
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,832
Looks don't get the work done.

118
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,414
Goodness, you guys look great together.

119
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,896
The sight of you two together
is too much for my eyes.

120
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,108
Be careful.

121
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,280
Block your own eyes.

122
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,610
Stop joking around.

123
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,212
Are you guys finally going out?

124
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,513
No.

125
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,418
Eat up.

126
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,721
Gosh, I'm so jealous. Enjoy your meal.

127
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,510
Are you bothered by
those kind of comments?

128
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,947
I don't care.

129
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,130
Really?

130
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,134
I'd love to be so
strong-minded like you...

131
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,747
...so that I wouldn't have to care
about what others say about me.

132
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,745
By the way,

133
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,348
are you not interested in dating anyone?

134
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,887
Do you not want a boyfriend?

135
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,147
I'm not really interested.

136
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,965
Why not? You're probably really popular.

137
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,247
I'm not popular.

138
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,669
There are so many pretty girls out there.

139
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,448
You're the prettiest girl
in our department.

140
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:38,546
Stop joking around.

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,581
I'm being serious.

142
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,511
Did I just make you feel uncomfortable?

143
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:51,886
No, that's not it.

144
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,419
But I'm sure you already know.

145
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:03,515
I did a lot of plastic surgery.

146
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,313
What's wrong with that?

147
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,614
You did it to become pretty,
and now you're pretty.

148
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,916
What's weird about that?

149
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,389
Let's eat.

150
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,115
How weird.

151
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,194
What's weird?

152
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:31,397
You don't seem weak-minded...

153
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,700
...seeing that you moved out
to live on your own.

154
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,204
Although I don't know why you had
to move out in the first place.

155
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:43,404
There's no special reason.

156
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:56,262
That's Mi Rae and Woo Young.

157
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,050
Thank you.

158
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:04,657
You really didn't have to buy me anything.

159
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,253
Stop thanking me. I only
bought instant noodles.

160
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,635
But still...

161
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,870
You're making me want to
treat you to another meal.

162
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:11,804
Pardon?

163
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:13,606
I need to get to class.

164
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,114
- Okay.
- See you again.

165
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,309
See you.

166
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,400
Hello?

167
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,456
You applied for a part-time job, right?

168
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,023
Yes.

169
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,126
Yes, I can make it to the interview.

170
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,997
Okay, thank you.

171
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,700
Mi Rae.

172
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:47,954
Did you eat?

173
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,891
Yes.

174
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:51,198
With whom?

175
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,812
Woo Young.

176
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,980
You guys must be really close.

177
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:59,180
Yes, we live in the same neighborhood.

178
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:02,021
Let's go home together later.

179
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:08,895
Kyung Seok and Woo Young live together.

180
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,299
I need to go somewhere.

181
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,601
Where?

182
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,802
I have an interview for a part-time job.

183
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,903
A part-time job?

184
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,305
Do they need more workers?

185
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:21,107
I'm not sure.

186
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,609
Can you ask them for me?

187
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,511
You can ask yourself.
I'll give you the number.

188
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,413
I've never done anything like that before.

189
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,216
Please do me a favor.
After all, we're friends.

190
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,223
I'll be off now.

191
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,725
See you guys later.

192
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:42,295
Kyung Seok, I wish you
good luck this time.

193
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,496
If you're neighbors,
does that mean you're close?

194
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,512
What?

195
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,897
You said you're close with Woo Young
because you're neighbors.

196
00:12:56,313 --> 00:13:00,613
I just said that because
Soo A asked me a question.

197
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,682
Does that mean we're close as well?

198
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,717
That doesn't apply to you.

199
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:05,918
What?

200
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,213
I mean, we were already friends...

201
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,524
...even before you moved
into my neighborhood.

202
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,014
Then can I go to the interview with you?

203
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:17,146
- Are you seriously going to go?
- Yes.

204
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,313
Why?

205
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,747
It's so weird.

206
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:37,950
Why?

207
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,000
Soo A.

208
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,179
I took a snap, but it
looks like a photoshoot.

209
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,604
Look.

210
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:03,109
You seemed really startled earlier...

211
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,911
...because of the report.

212
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,814
I would've been in big trouble
if it weren't for Kyung Seok.

213
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,584
You must've been worried your grade
might go down because me.

214
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,680
Don't say that.

215
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:18,060
But I hope you don't take pictures
without asking me like this.

216
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,154
Isn't it a crime to take someone's
pictures without their permission?

217
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,580
Soo A.

218
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,392
Do you think job interviews are a joke?

219
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,307
You can't bring your friend
as you please like this.

220
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,109
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,614
Okay.

222
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,314
Bye.

223
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,319
What did he say? Did he
tell us not to come?

224
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,621
No, he told us to come for now.

225
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,396
- You didn't do any part-time work?
- No.

226
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,298
You can work only on holidays
and weekends before the break.

227
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:00,400
That's right.

228
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,281
We'll work hard.

229
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,713
- Fill out the papers.
- Pardon?

230
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,014
They're the employment contracts.

231
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,216
You'll get paid per day,

232
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,018
so make sure you write down
your bank account correctly.

233
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:23,089
Thank you.

234
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,592
Get used to the product
explanations beforehand.

235
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,880
- Okay.
- Look at that guy.

236
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,596
He's too handsome to be human.

237
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,001
That girl's face isn't
so realistic either.

238
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,713
- Doesn't it look delicious?
- Yes.

239
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,213
Here.

240
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,111
No one would come at this hour.
They all went home.

241
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,115
I'll just have it myself.

242
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:19,979
It's delicious.

243
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:30,890
Look at this lovey-dovey couple.

244
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,599
Since when did you start going out?
Has it been a long time?

245
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:42,201
That's not it.

246
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:43,748
Is that right?

247
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,507
Can I join you guys then?

248
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,611
Hurry up. You said you aren't dating.

249
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,320
It's delicious. Keep it up.

250
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:09,996
- What are you reading?
- I got a part-time job.

251
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,597
I have to learn this.

252
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,600
Can you memorize the details
by reading that fast?

253
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,104
I'm good at memorizing.

254
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,909
I'll go to bed first.

255
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:25,013
Brush your teeth before you
go to bed, or they'll rot.

256
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:37,881
Today's menu is delicious tuna sashimi.

257
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,081
Do you see this?

258
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:49,819
I'll take a piece...

259
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,963
...and dip it into this soy sauce.

260
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:09,324
I got it as a gift.

261
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,280
(Kyung Seok)

262
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,205
Hold on.

263
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:34,513
- Hello?
- Have you had dinner?

264
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:39,115
Who are you? Do you know me?

265
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,286
You sound all right. I'm relieved.

266
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:45,430
Who says you can feel relieved?

267
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:47,430
Why on earth did you move out?

268
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,614
Let's meet up and talk tomorrow.

269
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,739
Not tomorrow. I have to go work part-time.

270
00:18:57,824 --> 00:18:58,824
What?

271
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:01,647
You're working part-time? Where?

272
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:06,925
At an interior design store? Where is it?

273
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,547
I'll call you again. Don't skip meals.

274
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:13,023
Brush your teeth before you
go to bed, or they'll rot.

275
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:22,613
What is he saying?

276
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,959
Aren't we going anywhere
during the break, my friend?

277
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:31,980
It's already late to book a place.

278
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,961
I don't think I can go.

279
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,977
I still have my hospital
installments to pay.

280
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,079
I should at least earn some pocket money.

281
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,281
Let's make it cheap and short.

282
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,483
It's a shame to waste our
time like this, isn't it?

283
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:54,148
Check everything you want
to do from this list.

284
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:57,983
(Everything about views in Hong Kong)

285
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,381
(To the best nature in Hong Kong)

286
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,468
I want to do everything.

287
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,938
I'll earn money and go on a trip
during my winter break for certain.

288
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:10,242
By the way, why are you
putting on a facial mask...

289
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:11,465
...when you're only
going to work part-time?

290
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,147
Are you going on a blind date?

291
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,951
What?

292
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,462
Are you going on a blind date?

293
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:33,065
No, I'm going to work.

294
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:34,333
Did you write a contract?

295
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,335
You have to be careful on that.

296
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:39,572
I signed the contract already.
Mi Rae was good at it.

297
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,075
Are you working part-time with her?

298
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,678
Yes, why?

299
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,480
Well...

300
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,687
I think you have to come home early today.

301
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:57,129
You have to clean the house, the toilet,

302
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:59,191
and the rooftop.

303
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,081
And you have to do the laundry too.

304
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,081
You told me to do the laundry
once every two days.

305
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,597
Well...

306
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,100
I mean, the blankets.
You have to wash the blankets.

307
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,103
I didn't know it was in the contract.

308
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,406
Sure, it's absolutely
included in the contract.

309
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:20,212
- This feels somewhat evil.
- What?

310
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,715
Evil?

311
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:26,786
You're becoming more rude as days go by.

312
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,513
Oh, hello.

313
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,280
Hi.

314
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:46,248
You didn't have to bring all these.

315
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:49,414
I felt sorry for having all
the fun without giving you...

316
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:51,028
...any housewarming gift last time.

317
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,847
I can't eat them all by myself.

318
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,947
Why would you do that?

319
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,952
You'll have them with Woo Young.

320
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,454
We're paying for our food
expenses separately.

321
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,456
That's written in the contract.

322
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:08,160
I don't know about other stuff, but
you shouldn't do that with food.

323
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,962
Two guys can finish this
much food in a few days.

324
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,063
Right.

325
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,065
That's what the contract says.

326
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,981
We'll take care of this matter.

327
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,888
I still have to wash the blankets, right?

328
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,781
I think you can do it later.

329
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,147
This is grapefruit-scented, and
the other is mandarin-scented.

330
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,914
Which one should I wear?

331
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,448
They're both fruit-scented.

332
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:04,748
Wear that perfume.

333
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:26,255
Ms. Na.

334
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,129
Hello.

335
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,380
I heard that both of you
have a shift today. Get in.

336
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,114
You don't need to give us a ride.

337
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:46,692
Get in.

338
00:23:53,514 --> 00:23:55,423
I'm sorry about the other day.

339
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,026
I drank more than I can handle.

340
00:23:58,113 --> 00:23:59,923
Don't worry about it at all.

341
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,375
I even passed out and threw up
here once when I got very drunk.

342
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,614
Oh, right.

343
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:15,775
Everyone at work gave positive
feedback about the candle you sent.

344
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,969
I've been meaning to
tell you, but I forgot.

345
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:19,354
Oh, really?

346
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,214
Everyone in our lab said that
the scent ratio is amazing.

347
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,897
I think it'd be good for you
to consult them in person.

348
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,699
I'd be so grateful for
such an opportunity.

349
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,600
What time does your lunch break start?

350
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,502
Shall we have lunch together?

351
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:34,373
Well, I'm not sure when
our lunch break is yet.

352
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,774
Is there anything you want to eat?

353
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,780
We're on our way to work now.

354
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:39,478
Yes, I know.

355
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,147
I shouldn't bother you
guys when you're working.

356
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,847
I'll just drop you off and leave.

357
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,250
Okay.

358
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,580
What time will you be done though?

359
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,180
I just wanted to tell
you to get home safely.

360
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:05,266
Hello.

361
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:08,707
Our showroom provides you with a
one-stop shopping experience.

362
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:12,296
From doors to kitchen units, you'll
find all furniture pieces here.

363
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,014
Please browse around and let me
know if you have any questions.

364
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,616
Good. That was great.

365
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,602
Even when a customer asks you
about something you don't know,

366
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,104
stay calm and friendly and
keep a smile on your face.

367
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,924
You can just come and get me or
ask anyone on the team for help.

368
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:28,014
- Are we all good?
- Yes, sir.

369
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:31,530
And you two will get the same
title as everyone else here.

370
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,415
You're our interior curators.

371
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:35,434
Everyone, let's get to work.

372
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:43,847
Thank you.

373
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:09,081
What are you doing here?

374
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:11,647
So you actually got a part-time job.

375
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:26,080
They want to know more about Kelun's
targeted marketing strategy.

376
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:28,661
I prepared our corporate
answer with regard to that.

377
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:30,208
Would you like to take a look?

378
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:36,414
You know that reading off this
will make me look less credible.

379
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,828
You guys have been updating me on it,

380
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,847
so I'll just say what I think.

381
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,218
Okay.

382
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:43,957
Here's our menu.

383
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:45,356
Thank you.

384
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,181
Let me know when you're ready to order.

385
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:52,655
Then you'll come up with the
corporate answer yourself...

386
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:54,746
Would he be around 20?

387
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:55,647
Pardon me?

388
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,951
He looks young. He must
be a part-timer, right?

389
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,154
Well, he could be a full-time server.

390
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,057
He doesn't look that young.
Why do you ask?

391
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:07,981
I was just curious.

392
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:20,939
Our meeting can be done by 4pm, right?

393
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:22,841
Yes, that's more than enough time.

394
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,510
Do you have another meeting after?

395
00:27:24,747 --> 00:27:26,345
I have to go somewhere.

396
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:32,282
So she's your little sister.

397
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,486
I've been wondering who she is.

398
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,189
Do you two live together?

399
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:38,190
No.

400
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,591
Then where are you staying now?

401
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,894
I told you. I live with a
senior from my school.

402
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,599
I'm not a senior. I'm a freshman as well.

403
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:49,902
It's nice to meet you.

404
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:53,314
Likewise, but I probably
won't see you after this.

405
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:55,199
- Sorry?
- After our dad's election,

406
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,797
I'll be going abroad to study...

407
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:59,115
...to escape the school system
here as my grades are bad.

408
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,314
Just stay if you don't want to go.

409
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,516
I'll try to talk to Dad again.

410
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,622
What do you want to eat?

411
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,927
I guess they don't have lunch sets.

412
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,720
I want pork cutlet as well as
Hamburg steak.

413
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,035
Then let's get one each...

414
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:24,547
...and share.

415
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,340
What about you?

416
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:30,448
I'll get pork cutlet too.

417
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,281
(Younglim Industrials)

418
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,909
I'll be off, then.

419
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:42,214
Go in first. I'm going to see her off.

420
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,916
It's okay. The bus stop is so close.
You don't need to walk me there.

421
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:45,917
I'm off.

422
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,119
Kyung Hee.

423
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,720
Bye.

424
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,428
She's very independent.

425
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,130
Shall we go in?

426
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:34,881
Kyung Hee.

427
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,021
Pass me the white plates over there.

428
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,162
Why are you smiling like that?

429
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,833
I must say, you're quite sweet
as a big brother.

430
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,348
Then you can call me a sweetheart.

431
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,742
- What?
- Kyung Seok.

432
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:18,643
Spare me a moment.

433
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:19,745
Sure.

434
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,881
What was that about?

435
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,885
I had no idea he could be that cheesy.

436
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,556
Has everything been well with you?

437
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,831
You must be surprised.

438
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,714
I know that this is very sudden.

439
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,313
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:49,519
The moment I saw you,

441
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,577
all I could think was that
I had to talk to you.

442
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,380
Why are you back?

443
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,683
What do you want to say
after all those years?

444
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:05,490
I want to say that I'm sorry.

445
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,514
I'm sorry about everything.

446
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,102
I should've took you guys with
me at all costs back then.

447
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,305
Everything I say will
sound like an excuse.

448
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:22,507
- But...
- "But"?

449
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,115
Ma'am.

450
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:26,812
Whatever you say now...

451
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:29,014
...won't change the fact
that you abandoned us.

452
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,917
Just because of a man.

453
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,347
You had an affair and left your
kids and husband for another man.

454
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,223
It's a fact, and it won't change.

455
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:41,626
I had an affair?

456
00:32:42,747 --> 00:32:43,745
What are you talking about?

457
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,864
I guess that face can't charm men anymore.

458
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,338
What's with that look on your face?

459
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:56,241
Why are you acting like a victim?

460
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,361
You should pity me.

461
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:01,346
Me...

462
00:33:02,068 --> 00:33:03,535
and Kyung Seok.

463
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,252
I pity our lives.

464
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:22,447
Crying won't solve anything.

00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,068
Bye.

468
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,771
Mi Rae, are you getting off work?

469
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:00,972
Yes.

470
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,575
- How's the work?
- It's okay.

471
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,080
Do you have time?

472
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,781
No, I'm sorry. My friend's waiting for me.

473

Let's go.

474
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,653
What did he say?

Mr. Park?

476
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,458
He asked if the job's okay and
that he'll treat me to a meal.

477
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,180
Let's go.

478
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:32,270
Five days' worth of pay will
be enough to last me a month.

- You need to pay rent, right?
- Yes.

481

- How much do you need to pay?
- 70 dollars.

I think he's making you
do all the housework...

487
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,260
...so that you won't
have to pay that much.

492
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,378
Hurry up and come home.
You have a lot of work to do.

493
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:18,850
Are you hungry?

494
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,387
Then I'll buy some pork belly on the way.

495
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,458
Do you pay for food?

496
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,293
We share whatever we buy.

497
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:32,998
By the way,

498
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,867
where can I buy pork belly?

499
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,469
What?

500
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,878
Why is he going to buy pork belly
when we have Korean beef?

501
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,215
- I'd like some pork belly, please.
- Okay.

502
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,854
No, not that one.
We'll take the one behind that.

503
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,990
Thank you.

504
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,260
Thank you.

505
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,398
Why did you choose this one?

506
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:10,585
It's not good when the color
of the fat is yellow.

507
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,371
It needs to be light pink like this one.

508
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:16,074
Where did you learn stuff like that?

509
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,909
This is all basic knowledge.

510
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,012
I went grocery shopping with
my mom ever since I was young.

511
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,596
Are you going to buy vegetables for wraps?

512
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,418
Yes.

513
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,101
Mi Rae gets drunk over
three glasses of soju.

514
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,104
And he gets drunk over two.

515
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:05,824
Did... Did you take Mi Rae home safely?

516
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,027
Yes, I tucked her in bed.

517
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:12,430
What?

518
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,213
- You should come too.
- Me?

519
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:41,226
I got a job thanks to you,
so I should treat you to a meal.

520
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,248
I guess I should buy some more pork belly.

521
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:47,966
Hyun Jung will be waiting for me at home.

522
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:49,948
Then tell her to come as well.

523
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:55,206
Why is he being so kind?

524
00:37:57,147 --> 00:37:59,010
- Do Sang Won...
- Do Sang Won...

525
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,147
- ...will brighten your lives!
- ...Will brighten your lives!

526
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,115
- Good work, everyone.
- Good work.

527
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,117
Thank you for your work.

528
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:08,548
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks.

529
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:21,914
Can we talk?

530
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,436
You're not as well-mannered
as you used to be.

531
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,507
You're the one who's ill-mannered
for lying to our children...

532
00:38:29,614 --> 00:38:31,001
...that their mother...

533
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:35,013
...left home because she had an
affair with some other guy.

534
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,815
I have people working for me here.

535
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,818
Will you please excuse us?

536
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:42,520
This won't be any beneficial
for his election.

537
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:46,280
Please excuse us.

538
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,492
Okay, sir.

539
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,381
Kyung Seok, you're pretty good now.
Did you practice?

540
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,578
No.

541
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,780
What's so hard about this?

542
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,282
He picked up pretty quickly
after a few lessons.

543
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,151
He just doesn't know a lot of stuff.

544
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,847
I'll do it now.

545
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:18,756
I'm not dumb. I know...

546
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,859
...you made up stories about me...

547
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,447
...so that things will
work to your advantage.

548
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,131
I held things in...

549
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,934
...because I felt sorry
toward the kids, not you.

550
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,920
But this is way out of line.

551
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:36,007
I don't care what others think about me,

552
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:38,810
but I can't stand my kids getting
the wrong idea about me.

553
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,213
The wrong idea?

554
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,148
What exactly is wrong?

555
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:47,919
Are you asking because you don't know?

556
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,088
What's the point of correcting the story?

557
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,923
Do you think anything will change?

558
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,693
This is a fact that will never change.

559
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:58,296
Regardless of what the reason was,
their mom still abandoned them.

560
00:39:58,714 --> 00:40:02,200
And their dad is the one who
protected them until now.

561
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,202
That will never change.

562
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:12,076
You're way too brazen.

563
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,247
Do you want me to leave
it to the public...

564
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,050
...to judge what you did to me...

565
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,152
...by stating the facts?

566
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,055
Are you threatening me right now?

567
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,771
You're thinking of it that way
because you have something to hide.

568
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:31,681
What do you say?

569
00:40:31,785 --> 00:40:35,366
I'd wreck your entire career
if I could have things my way.

570
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,980
I'm giving you a chance.

571
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,672
Tell our kids...

572
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,380
...the truth.

573
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:56,045
- It's so delicious.
- I know.

574
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:58,449
How can pork belly taste so good?

575
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,049
It's good, right? Eat up.

576
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:01,537
Why are you acting like
you did them a favor?

577
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:03,447
Can't you see that I'm grilling the meat?

578
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:07,706
I'm sure it's good-quality meat,

579
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,797
but I think it tastes better because
Woo Young's grilling it for us.

580
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:12,782
I agree. You grill meat so well.

581
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,014
Here.

582
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:23,214
Have a glass of soju.

583
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:25,717
Mi Rae probably won't drink any.

584
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:28,820
I don't want any either.
I prefer cola when I eat meat.

585
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:32,190
- You're going to drink, right?
- No, I don't feel like it today.

586
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,691
Why?

587
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,294
Is it because you collapsed
after two shots?

588
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,299
What... What are you talking about?

589
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,600
Me? You?

590
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,105
I... I only fell asleep
because it was time to sleep.

591
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,908
You must have low stamina.

592
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:53,511
Did you just question my stamina?

593
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:56,080
My nickname is Yeon Stamina.

594
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,516
- Do you mean Weak Stamina?
- Was that a joke?

595
00:41:58,614 --> 00:42:00,718
That was really lame.

596
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:01,914
It wasn't a joke.

597
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,214
I saw you collapse after you
drank two glasses of soju.

598
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:10,347
Kyung Seok.

599
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,231
One's ability to drink has
nothing to do with stamina.

600
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:14,630
There are guys who can drink...

601
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:17,735
...even though they're really
skinny and weak like you.

602
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,137
What did you just say?

603
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:26,714
What's going on right now?

604
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,449
Judging by the conversation,

605
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,318
it seems like we should
hold a stamina competition.

606
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,708
- What?
- You guys should arm wrestle...

607
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:38,227
...like a man.

608
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:42,126
Gosh, come on. His arm will break.

609
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:44,429
You must be scared.

610
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:50,514
Gosh, stop babbling with your mouth.

611
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,499
Just show us who's
stronger by arm wrestling.

612
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,596
You guys are both right-handed, right?

613
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,009
- Yes.
- Yes.

614
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,610
Okay, then that's a fair fight.

615
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:02,215
I think Woo Young will win.
What about you?

616
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,715
I'm not sure.

617
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,090
I'm not sure.

618
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,963
I really don't want anyone
to get hurt because of me.

619
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,566
You have no important
schedule tomorrow, right?

620
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,068
You'll be in pain for a while.

621
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,047
Kyung Hee, your father is home.

622
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,828
One might break his arm at this rate.

623
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:25,329
This is fun. Do you want
to try a round with me?

624
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,332
It's coming.

625
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:31,736
Gosh, it's so nerve-racking.

626
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,237
- A little more.
- Go for it.

627
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,748
Almost there.

628
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:48,019
I told you Woo Young would win.

629
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,424
You're stronger than I thought though.

630
00:44:54,814 --> 00:44:56,515
Don't be so down.

631
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,147
You couldn't beat me, but
you can beat others later.

632
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,734
Right, Kyung Seok. You did a good job.

633
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:08,147
Why would you depress him
even more by saying that?

634
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,647
Anyway, she was the one
who left you behind.

635
00:45:20,507 --> 00:45:23,607
Still, I wouldn't have had
to resent her that much.

636
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:27,032
I thought...

637
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:30,533
she was such a horrible person.

638
00:45:32,222 --> 00:45:34,190
Why did you make me keep that prejudice?

639
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:36,640
Who are you...

640
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:39,937
...to turn my mom into
that kind of a person?

641
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:42,440
Get out.

642
00:45:42,647 --> 00:45:44,242
Get out.

643
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:51,048
Let's talk later once you calm down.

644
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:12,108
We're leaving, bye.

645
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:14,147
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

646
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,297
Thank you for the meal, bye.

647
00:46:25,906 --> 00:46:26,914
Go home safely.

648
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:28,704
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

649
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,221
Come again.

650
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:38,148
I can do it today if you want.

651
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:39,814
It's okay.

652
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:46,771
Is your arm okay? If it hurts,
go see a doctor.

653
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:00,547
- Here.
- Thanks.

654
00:47:04,714 --> 00:47:06,741
Kyung Seok seemed like
he was in a bad mood.

655
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:09,760
I guess arm-wrestling is a big deal
in the world of men.

656
00:47:09,856 --> 00:47:12,852
It may be a bigger deal if it's
in front of someone he likes.

657
00:47:14,537 --> 00:47:18,051
No matter how much I see it,
he looked like he had feelings for you.

658
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:23,047
It's because he's finally got
a friend after a long time.

659
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,861
Still, what will you do...

660
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:27,965
...if he does like you?

661
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:33,246
No one would dare reject
someone so handsome like him.

662
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,480
Someone so handsome like
him isn't my type of man.

663
00:47:43,378 --> 00:47:45,246
My ideal type of man...

664
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:48,315
...is someone with an
average appearance...

665
00:47:48,514 --> 00:47:51,040
...who is okay with my
past plastic surgeries.

666
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,537
Someone who isn't so tall,

667
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:55,448
not so rich,

668
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,641
or not popular.

669
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:02,847
That's pretty picky.

670
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:04,749
Right?

671
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,718
What kind of guy do you like then?

672
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:13,433
Someone who looks neat?

673
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,347
For example?

674
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:19,130
Well...

675
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,133
Someone like Woo Young.

676
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,804
You're right.

677
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:31,114
Woo Young fits that criteria.

678
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:37,014
Don't you think your
standard is a bit too high?

679
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,513
I know.

680
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,218
This must be why both of
us can't date anyone.

681
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,614
Don't you think so?

682
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:44,513
Tell me about it.

683
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:00,938
Hello?

684
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,007
Hey, this is Soo A.

685
00:49:03,113 --> 00:49:04,914
What's up?

686
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,012
I'm calling just because I'm bored.

687
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:15,700
Have you decided to work
part-time with Kyung Seok?

688
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:18,311
Yes.

689
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,381
I have something to tell you.

690
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,795
Spare me some time to talk on Monday.

691
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,997
See you at school.

692
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,461
Who was it?

693
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:41,675
- Hyun Soo A.
- That weird girl?

694
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:43,490
I think she's really weird.

695
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,518
I just can't believe she invited
Yong Chul over without knowing.

696
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:56,894
Sir, this is bad.

697
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:03,601
I think Kyung Hee has run away from home.

698
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:14,875
Did you have a good night?

699
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,380
It's the last holiday before the election.

700
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,782
Your schedule today is
busier than any other days.

701
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,151
Kyung Hee ran away from home.

702
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,253
What?

703
00:50:23,347 --> 00:50:25,956
Look for her quietly without
letting others know.

704
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:27,258
Okay, sir.

705
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:49,480
He's so handsome again.

706
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:54,388
This isn't an ordinary sight
of someone going to work.

707
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,414
Why are you standing there?

708
00:51:14,482 --> 00:51:16,649
Oh, I'm coming.

709
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,957
You seemed to be in a bad mood yesterday.

710
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,354
Are you feeling better now?

711
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:34,258
Actually,

712
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,794
I went easy on him.

713
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,396
He lets me stay in his house
for a cheap amount of rent,

714
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,998
so I should do that much.

715
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:46,604
I see. Okay.

716
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,413
Just a second.

717
00:51:54,113 --> 00:51:56,880
- Hi, Mom.
- Do you have another shift today?

718
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,384
We're on our way to your place now
to drop off some side dishes.

719
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:01,885
Does she have to work again today?

720
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:04,855
She probably doesn't even make much a day.

721
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,380
She gets 100 dollars a day.

722
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,848
All right, then. Take it easy.

723
00:52:12,928 --> 00:52:14,829
- Shall we visit her at work?
- Gosh.

724
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:17,334
Do you know where it is?

725
00:52:17,913 --> 00:52:18,836
I sure do.

726
00:52:27,142 --> 00:52:28,547
Feel free to browse around.

727
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,581
Mi Rae.

728
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,251
Mom, what are you doing here?

729
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,556
Why do you think we're here?

730
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:39,356
We wanted to visit you at work.

731
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:42,660
You should've acted like a customer.
You're making her uncomfortable.

732
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:45,180
Hello.

733
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:57,448
Oh, Mom. He's my friend from school.

734
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:00,580
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

735
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,781
Hello.

736
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,085
What's your relationship with Mi Rae?

737
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,222
She just said they're friends.

738
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,492
Yes, she's my closest
friend in our department.

739
00:53:20,313 --> 00:53:21,613
Excuse me.

740
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:24,601
Yes, ma'am.

741
00:53:31,614 --> 00:53:34,344
Does this chair come in
different colors by any chance?

742
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:42,777
Shouldn't a guy like him become an actor?

743
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:46,214
How can someone be that handsome?

744
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,281
That is just not fair.

745
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,793
All right.

746
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,962
- We'll get going, then.
- Okay.

747
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,065
- I'll call you later.
- All right, go back inside.

748
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

749
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:00,971
See? Don't you think the
surgery was a good idea?

750
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,875
She can be friends with a guy
like that now that she's pretty.

751
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,481
Isn't that girl who just
walked by a Gangnam beauty?

752
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,081
Totally. She's a typical Gangnam beauty.

753
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,454
Not even just a beauty.
They called her a Gangnam beauty.

754
00:54:30,573 --> 00:54:32,255
Gosh, everyone is so
obsessed with Gangnam.

755
00:54:32,347 --> 00:54:34,347
People associate everything
nice with Gangnam.

756
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:36,248
- Let's go to a department store.
- What?

757
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,776
Actually, should I go
to a hair salon first?

758
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:42,663
I must make sure I look good enough
to call myself Mi Rae's mom.

759
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,880
I want to look like those
ladies in Gangnam.

760
00:54:47,668 --> 00:54:50,269
I'm due for a haircut too.

761
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:53,641
Mi Rae.

762
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:57,283
Good work today.

763
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,281
- I guess you work out a lot.
- Sorry?

764
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:00,798
You look very fit.

765
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:13,633
What did he say? Did he ask
you out for a meal again?

766
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:16,415
No, he asked me if I find
anything stressful.

767
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,222
Let's go.

768
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,057
Hello?

769
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:35,014
Did something happen?

770
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,248
You must've resented me to the point...

771
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:46,944
...that you can't even talk about it.

772
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,646
Kyung Hee is right.

773
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,016
Regardless of what I say now,

774
00:55:53,147 --> 00:55:54,751
nothing will change.

775
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,113
I can keep apologizing,
but it doesn't mean...

776
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,814
I can go back to that time
and hold you two in my arms.

777
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:07,344
I can't turn back the hands of
time and change what happened.

778
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,633
But...

779
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,236
I want you to know that I didn't leave...

780
00:56:12,347 --> 00:56:14,538
...you and Kyung Hee for another man.

781
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,741
That is really not true.

782
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,447
I'm sorry.

783
00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:27,163
It must've been much harder for you two.

784
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:30,354
In all those years...

785
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:33,148
It must've been so tough.

786
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:41,348
Yes, it was hard.

787
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:47,237
And I did resent you a little.

788
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,112
But you see,

789
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,917
I don't want any of us to
be in such pain anymore.

790
00:57:08,781 --> 00:57:10,048
Mom.

791
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:43,303
Thanks.

792
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:46,814
Thanks so much.

793
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,805
And I'm sorry.

794
00:57:57,013 --> 00:57:58,709
I must look shameless now.

795
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:03,613
I'm sorry that I can't
hide how happy I am.

796
00:58:29,283 --> 00:58:31,717
Did something happen to Ms. Na?

797
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:34,313
No, she's fine.

798
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:38,548
I see. I'm glad she's fine.

799
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:44,736
By the way,

800
00:58:45,427 --> 00:58:47,395
- do people cry out of joy?
- What?

801
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:49,326
Have you ever cried tears of joy?

802
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,414
Yes, I have. When I found out that
I got into Hankook University.

803
00:58:58,726 --> 00:59:00,937
Why do you ask?
It's never happened to you?

804
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,839
I'm not sure.

805
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:07,144
I guess you've never been that happy.

806
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,613
Maybe not.

807
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,714
Shall we go?

808
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,294
I'm not sure if it's enough
to make me cry, but...

809
00:59:25,046 --> 00:59:26,313
What?

810
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:29,014
I'm happy that we met again like this.

811
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:34,592
Do you really have feelings for me?

812
00:59:35,494 --> 00:59:38,395
If you keep doing this,
I'll totally fall for you.

813
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,058
Hyun Jung must be waiting for me.

814
00:59:42,547 --> 00:59:43,914
Let's hurry.

815
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:00,633
I'm at school now. Where are you?

816
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:21,751
How's your part-time job going?

817
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,555
It's been pretty good.

818
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,881
Will Kyung Seok keep
working there as well?

819
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:31,895
I think so.

820
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,601
Do they need another
part-timer by any chance?

821
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,196
- What?
- I think it'll be fun...

822
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,905
...to work with you and Kyung Seok.

823
01:00:45,631 --> 01:00:49,698
What's wrong? Will that
make you uncomfortable?

824
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:53,917
No, it's not that.

825
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,914
I'll look into it for you.

826
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:02,115
To tell you the truth,

827
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:05,881
I like Kyung Seok.

828
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,615
Can you help me?

829
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,148
Well...

830
01:01:18,113 --> 01:01:20,962
I don't think I can help you with it.

831
01:01:21,046 --> 01:01:22,296
Why not?

832
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,780
I'm asking you because
you're his closest friend.

833
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:29,344
Do you...

834
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,422
...have a crush on him too?

835
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:37,248
No way. Do you?

836
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:39,714
What's the problem?

837
01:01:40,147 --> 01:01:42,414
Am I not allowed to like him or what?

838
01:01:44,313 --> 01:01:47,437
You won't need my help.

839
01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:51,341
You're bright, active, and pretty.

840
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,043
You're pretty too.

841
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,181
What?--

842
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:56,829
Are you guys going out?

843
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,758
Why do you think so?

844
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:01,766
You're popular among guys as well...

845
01:02:02,249 --> 01:02:03,553
...because you're pretty.

846
01:02:07,044 --> 01:02:08,711
I think...

847
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:12,529
it's a blessing to be
pretty, don't you think?

848
01:02:15,414 --> 01:02:17,315
People naturally like you.

849
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:20,948
That must be why those
who aren't blessed...

850
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,741
...get plastic surgeries to
enjoy that kind of benefit,

851
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,746
harming the ones who were born pretty.

852
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:31,948
Harm?

853
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,451
I mean,

854
01:02:34,647 --> 01:02:36,553
pretty faces become less rare...

855
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,655
...because of plastic surgeries.

856
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,066
I thought I was mistaken...

857
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:55,305
...and that I was at fault for
judging you in a bad way.

858
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:57,774
But I wasn't mistaken.

859
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,581
You've hated me...

860
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:05,881
...from the beginning.

861
01:03:32,884 --> 01:03:36,969
