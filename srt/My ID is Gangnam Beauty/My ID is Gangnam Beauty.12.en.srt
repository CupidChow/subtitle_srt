1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,467
Mi Rae.

2
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,401
If...

3
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:20,399
...something like that
happens to you again,

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,118
I'll get involved without
punching someone.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,598
That will be okay, right?

6
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,500
If you keep saying things like that,

7
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,388
I'll get the wrong idea.

8
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:45,551
About what?

9
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,101
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

10
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,835
Never mind.

11
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,901
Get going. I'm going to head in.

12
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,216
Do you have...

13
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:20,748
...any feelings for me?

14
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,560
What?

15
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,401
No, it's not that.

16
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,196
If...

17
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,701
If you're offended by how I jumped
to conclusions like that, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:50,351
But I've never thought of you more
than a friend, so don't worry.

19
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:51,773
What? "Worry"?

20
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:53,968
That's not what I meant.

21
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:55,673
We're friends, you know.

22
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:59,248
I really think of you just as a friend.

23
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:01,834
100 percent.

24
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,916
Hey.

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,734
By any chance, do you...

26
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,910
Do you have a crush on someone else?

27
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,942
No, I don't have a crush on anyone.

28
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:26,588
See you tomorrow. I'm going to head in.

29
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,446
Do you have...

30
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,304
...any feelings for me?

31
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,968
No.

32
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:35,211
No, don't think about it.

33
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,768
I've already given up.

34
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,852
I can't date Kyung Seok.

35
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:47,068
I don't want my life to
get messed up again.

36
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,447
Did something happen? You seem upset.

37
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:19,852
There's no alcohol.

38
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,008
Oh, I noticed you didn't clean today.

39
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:27,006
I did it for you, so don't
forget from now on.

40
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,016
I'll just pay the full rent going forward,

41
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,168
so let's divide the housework.

42
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:39,387
Your part-time job must pay you a lot.

43
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,270
What's with him?

44
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,843
We're friends, you know.

45
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:05,744
I really think of you just as a friend.

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,267
100 percent.

47
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:31,951
What's wrong?

48
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,654
What? No, it's nothing.

49
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,949
What am I going to do if I run into him?

50
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:41,439
What am I supposed to say?

51
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,934
- Hey, it's a special lecture.
- It must be held by Kelun.

52
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,049
When's the lecture?

53
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,758
It doesn't say.

54
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:50,655
Does that mean we can meet
Ms. Na Hye Sung in person?

55
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,043
I can't wait.

56
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,359
It sounds fun.

57
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm glad I didn't enroll for classes
during the summer vacation.

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,644
Do you think Woo Young
will be attending as well?

59
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:01,640
If you like him so much,
you should doll yourself up like me.

60
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,713
That's not my true self.

61
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:06,426
I don't want to seduce him
by putting on an act.

62
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:09,008
Did you just say "seduce"?

63
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,331
That word really doesn't suit you.

64
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,535
Hey.

65
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,526
You put up a banner for me?

66
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,544
Of course. It was the least
I could do for someone so great.

67
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,775
I didn't think I'd be nervous.

68
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,910
But I am now that I'm here.

69
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:29,595
Are you going to sing?

70
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:31,492
Will they make me sing?

71
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:33,609
Of course. Kids these days are
very difficult to deal with.

72
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,989
Hearing you say that actually
made me pull myself together.

73
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,667
I wish you good luck.

74
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:40,975
Good luck.

75
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,787
What should I do?

76
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,111
Are you sure Woo Young's going to be here?

77
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:53,412
Gosh, stop talking about him.
I'm sure he'll be here.

78
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,235
("A Scent That Will Make People
Turn Their Heads and Remember You")

79
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:14,238
I guess the power of genetics
really is incredible.

80
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:17,670
My mother-in-law's so beautiful.

81
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,598
Since when did she become
your mother-in-law?

82
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,331
Since today.

83
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:29,314
I can see where Kyung Seok
got his handsome looks.

84
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,229
His mom's beautiful,

85
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,044
but Kyung Seok isn't that good-looking.

86
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:36,150
He and I are pretty
much on the same level.

87
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,878
We're both tall as well.

88
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:40,044
Do you have any conscience at all?

89
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,943
I'm sure you all know who she is, but
I'll still introduce her to you.

90
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,828
She's a proud graduate of Hankook
University's chemistry department,

91
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,856
and the CEO of Kelun Korea.
She's Ms. Na Hye Sung.

92
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,243
I'm glad to meet you all.
My name is Na Hye Sung.

93
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,430
Where's Kyung Seok?

94
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,177
His mom came to school...

95
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:12,880
...to do a lecture,
but he's not even here.

96
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,337
Our manager desperately
waited for you to come,

97
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,852
but he went to a seminar abroad.

98
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,695
I might not be as good as him,
but can I still give it a try?

99
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:30,793
I don't care as long as you pay me.

100
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:32,902
Thank you for trusting me.

101
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,215
Do I get paid right away?

102
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,643
Yes, you'll get paid
as soon as you're done.

103
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,544
Let's begin.

104
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,443
You have a girlfriend, right?

105
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,844
I hope she'll like it.

106
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,444
But then again, it must not matter
since you're so good-looking.

107
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,244
Even an afro would look like
a fashion trend on you.

108
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:59,418
What I meant to say is
that a person's look...

109
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,828
...is what actually
completes the hairstyle.

110
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,744
I won't do an afro on you. I'm not crazy.

111
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:09,029
Perfume always comes last.

112
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,058
Let me explain. When you
get ready to go out,

113
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:14,453
you put on your clothes,
do your hair, and put makeup on.

114
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,843
And nobody puts on perfume before
doing any of those things.

115
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,755
However, there are times when
this invisible last step...

116
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:23,445
...ends up lingering in people's
memories for a very long time.

117
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,477
It's hard to remember a
certain person's hairstyle,

118
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,559
or outfit from a long time ago.

119
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,682
But you do remember their smell,

120
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:32,859
and that stays in your head
along with that person's image.

121
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:40,081
This is yours, isn't it?

122
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,483
You can wear that perfume.

123
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,675
When you smell the steam coming
from a new batch of rice,

124
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,885
you're reminded of your
mother who lives back home.

125
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:54,261
And when you smell the perfume you
used to wear a long time ago,

126
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,392
you're reminded of how you
used to feel back then.

127
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,701
I'm not sure...

128
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:02,497
...how you'll remember me...

129
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,337
That's Kyung Seok.

130
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:18,852
I have to say, he kind of puts
himself in the spotlight.

131
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:40,027
I'm not sure how you'll
remember me after this lecture.

132
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,809
- Don't ever dye your hair like him.
- But I hope...

133
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:43,909
you'll at least remember...

134
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:46,814
- It doesn't look good on him.
- What I told you about scent.

135
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:50,523
If you wish to take part
in our company program,

136
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,441
please send in your applications.

137
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,647
I'll end my lecture here.

138
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,715
- Thank you for the lecture.
- Thank you for the lecture.

139
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:07,029
Thank you.

140
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:13,425
Your finals are coming up, right?

141
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,321
Yes.

142
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,139
Is everything okay?

143
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,650
What do you mean?

144
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:20,742
Well...

145
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,643
What's your plan for the summer?

146
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:24,359
Are you going to apply for the program?

147
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,799
I'll think about it.

148
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,011
Okay, but I hope you do apply.

149
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,257
I'll see you.

150
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,978
Is he going through late adolescence?

151
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,083
What's up with him?

152
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,777
Girls get their hair done after
they go through a break up.

153
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,494
I wonder if it's something similar.

154
00:11:58,643 --> 00:11:59,659
Sorry.

155
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,477
You dyed your hair.

156
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:12,373
Yes.

157
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,176
- It looks pretty.
- I didn't do it to look pretty.

158
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:19,359
Oh, sorry. It looks great.

159
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,061
I didn't do it to look great.

160
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:24,153
Oh, really? Then I guess you
just did it for no reason.

161
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,869
Not exactly.

162
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,025
Well, okay.

163
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,232
I'll go now. See you.
Good luck on your exams.

164
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,310
Why did I wish him good luck?
The exams haven't even started yet.

165
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:40,409
This is driving me crazy.

166
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,182
Do you think he's getting
ready to become a celebrity?

167
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:48,280
His personality isn't
fit to be a celebrity.

168
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,465
What's wrong with
Kyung Seok's personality?

169
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,278
It's not normal.

170
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,192
He'll never do as he's told.

171
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,679
With Kyung Seok's good looks,

172
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,198
his manager should be the one
following Kyung Seok's orders.

173
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,581
Do you still like Kyung Seok?

174
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:08,778
To be honest,

175
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,173
I gave up on him.

176
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,042
I'm done.

177
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:19,126
But he's too good-looking
to erase from my heart.

178
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:23,788
I know you guys also have a
small crush on him as well.

179
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:25,404
Aren't I correct?

180
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,715
Be honest with me. My cooking
was terrible, wasn't it?

181
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,576
You can be honest with me.

182
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,676
It wasn't that bad.

183
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,221
By the way, Kyung Hee.
Will you take a look at this?

184
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,005
- Is that Kyung Seok?
- Yes.

185
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,325
I didn't want to sound too nagging,

186
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:09,737
so I couldn't ask him
why he dyed his hair.

187
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,935
He's not the type who
cares about how he looks.

188
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,322
I wonder what's gotten into him.

189
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:16,655
Maybe he's dating someone.

190
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,073
Do you think so?

191
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:21,876
Or maybe he got his heart
broken by someone.

192
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:25,943
By whom?

193
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:34,195
Thanks.

194
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,907
I want you to write me a receipt.

195
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,693
You said a verbal agreement
wouldn't be effective.

196
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,901
I see you've gotten used to
the life in the society now.

197
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:45,721
Didn't I say that I learn
everything quickly?

198
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,533
It's partly thanks to my useful tips.

199
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:49,332
It's not cool to take credit.

200
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,951
- How cool of you.
- Aren't you writing me a receipt?

201
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,725
Did you do a modeling for a hair salon?

202
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,709
How did you know?

203
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,921
I told you I've done almost
every part-time job.

204
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,377
(Do Kyung Seok has paid...)

205
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:12,272
I thought you wouldn't do such thing
with your personality.

206
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:13,857
Did you not like doing
house chores that much?

207
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,070
Or did you have a change in mind?

208
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,651
Don't act like you know
everything about me.

209
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,506
He changed back his hair color.

210
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,024
I got this question wrong.

211
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:46,436
The finals are finally over!

212
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:51,218
The finals are over, so how
about we go play games?

213
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,415
Deal. Let's get it.

214
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,625
Let's go.

215
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,504
I'm free.

216
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,895
Why don't we go eat something delicious?

217
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,811
Let's not eat near school.
I want to go somewhere far away.

218
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,790
Let's go.

219
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,142
Let's go.

220
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:13,732
Hello, Ms. Na.

221
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:17,912
Yes, I'm done with my finals.

222
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay.

223
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:25,375
Didn't I gain weight?

224
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:28,382
I ate too much because I was
stressed out during the finals.

225
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,991
No, you didn't.

226
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,141
You say that all the time.

227
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,731
How did you do on your finals?

228
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,041
- Hello.
- Hi.

229
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:39,747
About going on a field trip to
Kyung Seok's mother's company...

230
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:41,678
Are there senior applicants?

231
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:44,575
- Not that I know of.
- Is that right?

232
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,289
It might be quite awkward then.

233
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:47,795
Are you going to apply for it?

234
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,028
Never mind, it wouldn't look
good for me to be there.

235
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:56,030
Are you still sulky?

236
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,706
Goodness. Bye.

237
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:00,821
Bye.

238
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,907
- What did you just do?
- What?

239
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:07,006
Don't you know that he spoke
ill of me for being fat?

240
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,291
How could you talk with him
like nothing happened?

241
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,874
But it's not like I'm never
going to see him again.

242
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:15,780
Kyung Seok turned him into a mop.

243
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:17,342
Even classmates care for each other.

244
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,748
What's up with you?

245
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:20,874
Tae Hee.

246
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,252
Tae Hee, let's go eat something delicious.

247
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:26,019
Tae...

248
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,417
Gosh, it's tiring.

249
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,937
Dong Won, you must've been really hungry.

250
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:43,126
Sorry I couldn't take care of you
because I was busy with my finals.

251
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,573
Is it good?

252
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,865
Hi, Dong Won.

253
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,546
Guys, I think...

254
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,277
...the beauty in my department
really has a crush on me.

255
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:02,081
That's only your delusion.

256
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:05,479
No, I'm telling you.
The name of her cat...

257
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,281
...is the same with my name.

258
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,757
Maybe your name is Na Bi or Kitty.

259
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:13,040
It's rarely used to name a cat.

260
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:14,643
It's for people.

261
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:16,864
Can this be a coincidence?

262
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,327
Can you still say that
she doesn't like me?

263
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,464
It must've been hard
studying for your finals.

264
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,946
Eat up.

265
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:32,941
Thank you.

266
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,840
Let me do it.

267
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,428
Moms usually do this kind of stuff.

268
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:40,745
Eat up already.

269
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,733
Thank you.

270
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:50,201
By the way, didn't you want
to say something to me?

271
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,506
Actually, I have a question.

272
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,183
Nothing special has happened
to Kyung Seok, right?

273
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:06,384
I don't think so.

274
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,787
Then why did he do that to his hair?

275
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:12,775
According to Kyung Hee,
he isn't interested in his looks.

276
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,541
I'm not so sure about that,

277
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,175
but he's dyed his hair back to black.

278
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:19,272
Really?

279
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:21,206
I was worried...

280
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:24,380
...I might come off as being nosy if
I asked about it directly to him.

281
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:26,815
I see.

282
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:34,573
I guess you're the one in trouble.

283
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,366
What?

284
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:38,913
Are you worried about something?

285
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,286
You must not want to
share it with me. Sorry.

286
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:51,276
Well...

287
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,684
That's...

288
00:21:57,173 --> 00:22:00,784
Woo Young, I want to apply
for the field trip.

289
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:01,899
Okay.

290
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,388
Let's see.

291
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,674
(List of Field Trip Applicants)

292
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,103
Your name is Hyun Soo A, right?

293
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:10,499
Yes.

294
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,464
(Ko Ye Na, Kim Tae Hee,
Yoo Eun, Jang Won Ho,)

295
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:16,992
(Lee Ji Hyo, Kim Sung Woon,
Jung Dong Won, Hyun Soo A)

296
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,576
It's done.

297
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,376
Thank you. Goodbye.

298
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:22,483
Bye.

299
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,688
Kyung Seok, are you here to apply...

300
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,664
What's up?

301
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:35,457
Don't tell me you're here
to call off the rent issue.

302
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:36,974
I'm here to apply for the field trip.

303
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:39,756
- To Kelun?
- Yes.

304
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,488
Do better for your mother.

305
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:48,390
That's my business, not yours.

306
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:54,364
Are you mad at me?

307
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,710
It's done, right? Bye.

308
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:08,212
He's acting the opposite
from the way he seems.

309
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:15,397
You like him,

310
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,551
and he seems to like you too,

311
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:19,346
so why do you have to give up?

312
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:24,752
I think it's because I'm scared.

313
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:30,682
He's beyond my league.

314
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:32,360
He's too perfect for me.

315
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,669
Still, you two like each other, so why?

316
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,049
The thing is,

317
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,572
a girl who's super pretty
has a crush on him.

318
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,175
And everyone says that
they'd make a cute couple.

319
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:51,349
As you know, I got plastic surgery
all over my face. If he dates me...

320
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:54,689
...instead of that girl, what will
people say? I'm just so scared.

321
00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:56,904
I see.

322
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:00,408
I must sound like an idiot.

323
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:05,109
But still,

324
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:07,788
what matters is the fact that
you two like each other,

325
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,688
so don't think about other people.

326
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,507
That's what everyone will say though.

327
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:17,892
I understand.

328
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:21,729
I'm sure many girls will feel
that way in your situation.

329
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,598
I'm getting angry at the people...

330
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:27,794
...who made you think that.

331
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:30,924
I don't know the details,

332
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:33,514
so I can't really give you advice.

333
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:37,144
But perhaps, that pretty girl...

334
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:41,256
isn't much different from you.

335
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:47,049
I just don't want you to
have any regrets later on.

336
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:53,651
You've applied for the
lab experience, right?

337
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:54,461
Pardon?

338
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:01,236
Let's eat.

339
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:04,835
Have this too. Help yourself.

340
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:06,930
Thank you for the food.

341
00:25:15,995 --> 00:25:17,380
Soo A may not be...

342
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,885
...that different from me?

343
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:30,132
Hi, Woo Young.

344
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:33,323
I'm on my way home now.

345
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,506
Mi Rae.

346
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:38,723
My gosh.

347
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,193
Good timing.

348
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:42,702
Hello.

349
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,110
Can we talk for a minute?

350
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:47,707
Sure.

351
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,016
I noticed that you haven't applied.
Have you forgotten about it?

352
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:53,974
No.

353
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,823
I'm thinking of visiting my
family during summer break.

354
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:01,306
But it's not for the whole summer.

355
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,095
You can visit them after it's done.

356
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,966
I just thought you'd definitely apply...

357
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,076
...because you're very
interested in perfume.

358
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:12,471
And most importantly, I think...

359
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,074
...it'd be a good chance for you to
find out how suited you are...

360
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,975
...to pursue a career in
the perfume industry.

361
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,480
Besides, there may not be
another opportunity to get...

362
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,074
...a first-hand experience at a
perfume lab until you graduate.

363
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,790
Can I still apply for the program?

364
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,974
Of course. I'll add your
name to the list right away.

365
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,964
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

366
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,367
Wait, Woo Young.

367
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,174
Thank you.

368
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:50,475
Then are you free on Wednesday?

369
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:51,623
Sorry?

370
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:53,907
Let's watch a movie. We can
get a discount that day.

371
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,683
Then I'll let Hyun Jung know as well.

372
00:26:58,674 --> 00:26:59,974
Just the two of us.

373
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:03,908
I have something to tell you.

374
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:07,741
Okay.

375
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,141
Let's go.

376
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,034
I've gained a bit of weight.

377
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,508
Hey, wait.

378
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:57,528
Dong Won.

379
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:00,656
I heard...

380
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,679
...that canned tuna is high in sodium.

381
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:06,285
You shouldn't give it to cats.

382
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,287
If you still want to, you
should rinse it in water...

383
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,541
...to remove the oil and sodium
before giving it to them.

384
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,959
Hey, Soo A!

385
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,874
Oh, hi.

386
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,656
- Have you eaten yet?
- Yes. What about you?

387
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,341
I've eaten too.

388
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:33,041
Hi, Mi Rae.

389
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,838
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:28:35,938 --> 00:28:37,549
Let's sit over there.

391
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,241
Hi.

392
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:40,673
Hi.

393
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,474
Do you guys still work there part-time?

394
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,160
No, we quit.

395
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:49,874
Kyung Seok too?

396
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,507
Yes.

397
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,308
Hi, Kyung Seok.

398
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:03,242
I heard you quit your part-time job.

399
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:11,148
He shouldn't have gotten involved
in that thing. I feel bad.

400
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:23,008
Nice to meet you all.

401
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:25,408
I'm Chief Director Lee Soo Hyun.

402
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:27,606
This is Ms. Yun Soo Kyeong,

403
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:28,916
who will be your guide.

404
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:31,378
Hello, everyone. It's
nice to meet you all.

405
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,153
While getting your first-hand
experience at our lab,

406
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:39,175
you'll also learn about theories
and the history of perfume.

407
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,571
If you have any questions or suggestions,

408
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,476
you can speak to Ms. Yun here.

409
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,237
- Okay.
- Okay.

410
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:49,141
Yes, come in.

411
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,595
Why did you come to school today?

412
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,674
I'm taking a summer class.

413
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,495
Oh, I see.

414
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:58,586
What brings you here?

415
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,205
There's something I want to tell you.

416
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,808
Me?

417
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:05,270
I'm not an eloquent speaker,

418
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,507
so I wrote down what I want to tell you.

419
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,060
Okay, bye.

420
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,407
Dear Woo Young,

421
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:37,074
I'm Kwon Yoon Byul in second year.

422
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,571
I have a crush on you.

423
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,673
You're very responsible and
have a strong sense of ethics.

424
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,974
You also respect women.

425
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,308
I like everything about you.

426
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:49,381
I wrote this letter because I'm
too shy to tell you in person.

427
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,583
With warm regards, Kwon Yoon Byul.

428
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,241
Shy, my foot. She's so brave.

429
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,556
My gosh, what should I do about this?

430
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,162
First, go ahead and smell
the undiluted scents.

431
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,859
Then please write down which scents...

432
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,566
...are in the perfume I gave you guys.

433
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,660
Because I've been smelling
all these different scents,

434
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:23,992
I can't even smell anything now.

435
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:27,319
You'll have to reset your sense
of smell here and there.

436
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,007
You can either take a short break...

437
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,224
...or try smelling coffee beans here.
It'll help.

438
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,449
I think it has these scents.

439
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,654
You're right. You guessed every
scent in the perfume correctly.

440
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,358
That's impressive.

441
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,828
Are you Kang Mi Rae? You're the
one who sent us that perfume.

442
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,842
Everyone in our lab loved that perfume.

443
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,832
We've been wanting to meet you in person.

444
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,332
Thank you for the compliment.

445
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,905
My gosh, you're a perfume expert.

446
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:44,241
It wasn't supposed to rain today.

447
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,573
Woo Young.

448
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,473
Woo Young.

449
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,443
Wait, Woo Young.

450
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,746
What were you pondering?

451
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,549
Well, just some things.

452
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:08,808
Have you had dinner yet?

453
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,808
Oh, right. Come to think of it,
I didn't even have lunch today.

454
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,708
Are you saying you didn't eat all day?

455
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,541
That's bad.

456
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:18,241
Thanks for your concern.

457
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,834
Well...

458
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:26,438
Do you want to grab dinner with me?

459
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,340
Sure, what should we eat?

460
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,543
Then... Since it's a hot day,

461
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,445
let's just go somewhere close.

462
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,013
- Sure.
- Great.

463
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,002
- Welcome.
- Hello.

464
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,788
- Hi.
- You can sit over there.

465
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:53,297
He's still here.

466
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:55,796
He's a part-timer now, not the owner.

467
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,002
Really?

468
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:02,407
- He must've gone bankrupt.
- Exactly.

469
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,908
Hey.

470
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:06,506
What do you want? Beer?

471
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,315
I don't think I'm good with perfume.

472
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:11,917
I can't even smell anything anymore.

473
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:14,219
I enjoyed it. I wasn't
interested in perfume,

474
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,520
- but it was really fun.
- I know.

475
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,207
- Right?
- Yes.

476
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,724
Mi Rae, you looked really excited.

477
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,826
You must really like perfume.

478
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,601
- I'm hungry.
- But you already ate.

479
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,307
Why are you sitting here
alone like a loner?

480
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,907
I was a loner all my life.

481
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,008
What would you have done without me?

482
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,507
I know, right?

483
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,008
Do you guys all want beer?

484
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,713
- Beer sounds good.
- Sure.

485
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,075
Kyung Seok, what are you doing there?

486
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,241
You should go.

487
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,007
I can't be bothered. I'm going to
leave after I'm done with this.

488
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,224
Kyung Seok, get over here.

489
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,427
- Kyung Seok.
- Come on.

490
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,223
- Come sit here.
- Just go.

491
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:00,340
You're practically
volunteering to be a loner.

492
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,935
I thought things were getting
better, but you're doing it again.

493
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,640
- Kyung Seok.
- Come on.

494
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,441
Gosh, he's so cold-hearted.

495
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,540
Is there something going on?

496
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,758
There's something on my mind.

497
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,974
What is it?

498
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:37,573
Well, the thing is, someone confessed...

499
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,241
...their feelings for me today.

500
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,239
What?

501
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,742
Why are you so startled?

502
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,443
Is it that shocking?

503
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,640
No, it's not shocking.

504
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:50,515
Gosh, you're really popular.

505
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,017
I'm not popular.

506
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,307
What are you going to do?

507
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:02,239
I'm just thinking about how
I'm going to turn her down.

508
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,272
Have you already made up your mind?

509
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:08,967
Yes, I can't suddenly like someone...

510
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,169
...just because that person likes me.

511
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:16,041
I guess you're very clear
with what you want.

512
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,043
I just know what kind of women I like.

513
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,547
Don't be too harsh though.

514
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:28,453
Some people say you should be
cold when you reject someone.

515
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:31,241
But if she's a decent person,

516
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,927
she'd appreciate it if
you reject her politely.

517
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,464
I guess you're right.

518
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,274
I feel like it'll scar her for
life if the guy she likes...

519
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,970
...says harsh things to her.

520
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:49,774
That's never happened to me, but still.

521
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,277
You must know well even
without experience...

522
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,974
...because you're a psychology major.

523
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,050
Isn't Hwang Min Hyun so good-looking?

524
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,752
I'm not sure.

525
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,640
I think Ong Seong Wu is handsome.

526
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,441
I like guys who look cold-hearted.

527
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,974
What about you, Soo A? Who's
your favorite celebrity?

528
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,565
Me? I don't know much about celebrities.

529
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,340
I'm just into guys who like me.

530
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:22,440
What about you, Mi Rae?

531
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,109
What?

532
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,012
I've never heard you talk about guys.

533
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,914
What kind of guys do you like?

534
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,921
I haven't really thought
about it that much.

535
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:41,126
Do you like guys who treat
you a little coldly?

536
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,528
You're the first girl
to treat me this way.

537
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,629
Or...

538
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,132
Let me become your firefighter.

539
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,733
Do you like guys who are warm?

540
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,235
Which kind of guy do you prefer?

541
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:53,041
-I just like normal kind of guys.

542
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,441
What's the standard of normal?

543
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,042
This is so frustrating.

544
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,940
Fine, let's just say you
don't have an ideal type.

545
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,649
I like warm-hearted guys.

546
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,540
- I'm going to leave.
- Kyung Seok.

547
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,807
See you, Kyung Seok.

548
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,223
Bye.

549
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,507
It seems like he's becoming more arrogant.

550
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,007
It bothers me.

551
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,107
Take it.

552
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:51,407
It might start raining again.

553
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,401
Okay.

554
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:00,004
- Thanks.
- No.

555
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,707
I'm the one who should thank you.

556
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,741
Is that for Mi Rae?

557
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,319
It's not for me, is it?

558
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,741
I told you...

559
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,256
...to cut it out.

560
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:27,833
What are you talking about?

561
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:30,034
Stop pulling tricks I don't understand.

562
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,241
Why do you talk to me that way?

563
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:36,341
I'm trying my best to
become friends with you.

564
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:39,944
I sincerely like you.

565
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,141
Even if I hated you,

566
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,750
I still wouldn't have treated you
like this if you were sincere.

567
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:01,874
Do you still not feel anything?

568
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,088
Wait.

569
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,927
Did you really feel nothing?

570
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:34,601
You must be mentally ill.

571
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,580
Why didn't you answer my calls?

572
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:10,239
And why did you run away?

573
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,308
Because I saw you with her.

574
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,671
Are you okay?

575
00:42:21,307 --> 00:42:22,741
Did it upset you?

576
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,175
I already told you...

577
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,241
...that I'm not interested in her.

578
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,642
You'll get wet.

579
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,564
Don't change the subject.

580
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:49,767
Do you really not know?

581
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:52,974
What?

582
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,174
That I like you.

583
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,878
Let's start dating.

584
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,082
Don't try to avoid and
answer me this time.

585
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:09,987
Why?

586
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,792
Why would a guy like you have
feelings for someone like me?

587
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:16,961
What do you mean by a guy like me...

588
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:21,165
...and a girl like you?

589
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,270
You know already.

590
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,879
Can't you imagine what people
will say if we're together?

591
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,884
They'll wonder why such a guy
goes out with such a girl.

592
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:41,185
So?

593
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,088
What do you think about me?

594
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,308
You're someone...

595
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,874
...who can't be nothing
more than a friend.

596
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,404
Forget about what can or can't be done.

597
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,709
What do you think about me?

598
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,611
I think...

599
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,482
...you and I can't be together.

600
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,288
I told you the other day...

601
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,741
...that people would say you're
cool even if you live your way,

602
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,175
but it's not the same for me.

603
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,564
I was bullied because of my ugly face
throughout my school life.

604
00:44:26,757 --> 00:44:29,474
And now, people gossip
about my plastic face.

605
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,468
Hey.

606
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,771
All I want to know is
what you think about me,

607
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,835
not what others say.

608
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,442
Others' opinions are important to me.

609
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:44,348
You think I'm obsessed with
appearances, don't you?

610
00:44:44,874 --> 00:44:48,653
But you don't know how
hard it has been for me.

611
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:50,941
If I'm with you,

612
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,159
my life becomes a torture.

613
00:44:58,563 --> 00:44:59,964
Even from the start,

614
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,170
I didn't have a chance?

615
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:08,573
No.

616
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,430
At last,

617
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,166
it has ended this way.

618
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:20,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

619
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:22,208
Hi.

620
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:23,791
What?

621
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:25,109
(To Soo A)

622
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,279
Thank you for the drink.

623
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,381
What?

624
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,190
Here's what happened with my fling today.

625
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,159
She enjoyed the drink I gave her.

626
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,595
We're flirting with each
other for real, right?

627
00:47:44,707 --> 00:47:47,690
I think it's true that you get a
girlfriend when they enter college.

628
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:50,701
But I had no idea it'd be
such a pretty girl like her.

629
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,671
It must be true how pretty girls
don't go for the hot guys.

630
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,506
What is he saying?

631
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:05,838
Soo A, I thought you might not be
able to finish all the food you got,

632
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:07,218
but you've actually finished it all.

633
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,020
She usually doesn't leave any of her food.

634
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,274
And she's that skinny?

635
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,660
I don't easily gain weight
no matter how much I eat.

636
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:20,097
She says that stresses her out.

637
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:23,282
Why would you get stressed out by that?

638
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,069
She's so annoying.

639
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,370
Seriously.

640
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,773
Hey, lower your voice.

641
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:02,606
Let's talk for a second.

642
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,014
Have you had lunch?

643
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:12,516
No.

644
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:20,125
If you're going through a
hard time because of me,

645
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,727
I should stop doing that.

646
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,536
But if by any chance,

647
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,508
you think we can go back
to being friends...

648
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,812
...I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

649
00:49:45,507 --> 00:49:46,717
Still,

650
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,040
I'll wait.

651
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:15,399
You look pretty, so stop
looking in the mirror.

652
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:20,210
It's been a long time since
I heard you say I'm pretty.

653
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:22,208
Back in the days when
you wanted to date me,

654
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,974
you said it every time
you opened your mouth...

655
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,390
...as if that was all you had to say.

656
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:28,592
I told you so because you were pretty.

657
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,722
You were the most beautiful
woman in our neighborhood.

658
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:31,901
Tell me about it.

659
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,733
When I said I was getting married
with you, everyone got shocked...

660
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,017
...for choosing a man by his
personality instead of backgrounds.

661
00:50:39,126 --> 00:50:41,105
They said even my heart was pretty.

662
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:44,108
Come on. I was a successful
business man back then.

663
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,610
And they got shocked once again...

664
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,222
...because this pretty woman
was living a bright life...

665
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,740
even after her husband's business...

666
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,142
...went completely bankrupt.

667
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:55,336
All right, you're going through a
lot thanks to your pretty looks.

668
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,224
Let's stop by that senior's
house first and go to Mi Rae's.

669
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:03,994
It must be hard for you to
carry two watermelons alone.

670
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:06,784
I'm fine.

671
00:51:06,874 --> 00:51:09,974
I can't make my pretty wife
carry them even if it's hard.

672
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:19,206
Do you think I look like Mi Rae?

673
00:51:19,306 --> 00:51:21,612
Do I look like a mom
of the Gangnam beauty?

674
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:25,316
Yes, you guys look very much alike.

675
00:51:25,407 --> 00:51:28,786
Goodness gracious.

676
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,889
What do you think about
your brother's house?

677
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:34,008
I'd like to take a look
inside his house too.

678
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:38,295
I'm glad you two grew up
as affectionate siblings.

679
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:40,197
Let's go.

680
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,606
Who are you?

681
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:50,807
Are you Woo Young's mother?

682
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:55,112
No, I'm the mother of Woo Young's junior.

683
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,414
She lives near here.

684
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,583
Near here?

685
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:02,674
Are you Mi Rae's mother by any chance?

686
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,772
Hello, I'm the mother of a
boy named Do Kyung Seok.

687
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:10,874
He lives with Woo Young.

688
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,463
He and Mi Rae are colleagues in school.

689
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,590
Do Kyung Seok?

690
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,774
Oh, that pretty young man?

691
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,185
Do you know him?

692
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,273
- Yes.
- Yes.

693
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,273
We know him. It's good to meet you.

694
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,010
It's nice to meet you.

695
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,013
I didn't think...

696
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:32,016
...I'd meet with other parents
once my girl entered college.

697
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:35,419
I'm happy we met like this.

698
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,325
Unfortunately, I couldn't be there
for my kids when they were younger.

699
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:44,790
Watching Mi Rae grow must've
made you very happy.

700
00:52:44,874 --> 00:52:46,563
She's kindhearted and smart.

701
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:49,273
She also knows how to have fun.
She's a great dancer as well.

702
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:51,168
Oh, really?

703
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,070
I must say,

704
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,807
I wondered who gave
Kyung Seok his good looks.

705
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,209
He sure got it from you.

706
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,480
You look so young for your age.

707
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,083
You really are a Gangnam beauty.

708
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:09,572
My mom didn't get any plastic surgery.

709
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:11,388
Sorry?

710
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,589
That remark about Gangnam.

711
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,292
People say that to those who got a
lot of work done on their faces.

712
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:41,673
Gosh.

713
00:53:48,006 --> 00:53:49,540
All right. Great work, everyone.

714
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,740
What you did today will take
up most of your time...

715
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,438
...if you do join a perfume
lab down the road,

716
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:55,649
so don't forget what you learned.
Write down everything, okay?

717
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,367
- Okay.
- Okay.

718
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,342
(Koo Tae Young)

719
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,979
Can we meet up later today?
Just the two of us.

720
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:08,949
Hey, Woo Young.

721
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:11,809
- Hey, are you done?
- Yes.

722
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,310
Where are you now?

723
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,014
I'm near the Kelun lab.

724
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:18,607
Where shall we meet today?

725
00:55:18,807 --> 00:55:20,918
Why don't we eat something
good after the movie?

726
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,319
Today?

727
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:27,291
Right, okay.

728
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,106
Do you have a reservation?

729
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,355
- Yes, under Yeon Woo Young.
- Just a moment, please.

730
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,928
Wasn't the movie so good?

731
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,931
That man's dance was hilarious.

732
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,433
Yes, it was funny.

733
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,040
Shall we have a drink too?

734
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,739
You want to drink? You know
that I'm a lightweight.

735
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:16,940
Right.

736
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:20,644
I'm actually worse than you.

737
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,542
I can't drink more than two shots of soju.

738
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,841
Seriously? I had no idea.

739
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,875
There are many other things
that you don't know.

740
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:30,642
I don't like pork belly,

741
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,341
and I get cold very easily.

742
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:35,192
I hate studying,

743
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,661
and I like you.

744
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:49,950
I was worried that things
might get awkward for you...

745
00:56:50,037 --> 00:56:51,942
at school because of me,
so I've been hesitating.

746
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:52,743
But...

747
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:58,849
I've had a crush on you
since we first met.

748
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,456
I guess you really had no idea.

749
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:13,974
- But why?
- What?

750
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:16,366
Why do you like me?

751
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,672
Because you're pretty.

752
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,478
You always look grumpy as if
you're bothered by something,

753
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,614
but I notice the subtle differences.

754
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,018
Today, it must be something super serious.

755
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,989
If it's that serious, it must be about...

756
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,709
...something that's never happened before.

757
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:43,794
It's about a girl, right?

758
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,408
It must be. Hey, are you
seeing someone now? Who is it?

759
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,703
It's none of your business.

760
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,504
I wonder who it is.

761
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:57,508
Who's the girl that melted
this cold guy's heart?

762
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,606
By the way, what's the problem?

763
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,107
She said she can't date me.

764
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,113
What? She even rejected you?

765
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,650
She said she "can't", not that
she doesn't want to date me.

766
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:08,852
I don't get it.

767
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,907
Is she ugly?

768
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:16,341
- No.
- She's pretty?

769
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,928
You don't like pretty girls.

770
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:21,031
She's neither pretty nor ugly.

771
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,033
She's just herself.

772
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,041
You like me just because I'm pretty?

773
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,741
All guys like pretty girls.

774
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,247
And you're totally my type.

775
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,574
Are you that surprised to hear all this?

776
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:38,648
Yes.

777
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:44,654
I didn't know that you
were that kind of person.

778
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:47,958
What?

779
00:58:48,774 --> 00:58:51,995
Did you start liking me
just because of my looks?

780
00:58:54,474 --> 00:58:56,767
What's wrong with being
attracted to good looks?

781
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:59,403
Are you not attracted to handsome guys?

782
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,905
It doesn't have to be about good looks.

783
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,974
Some like girls with double eyelids.

784
00:59:05,373 --> 00:59:08,612
Some are attracted to skinny
girls or girls with fair skin.

785
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,614
Everyone has a type, you know.

786
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:15,685
I told you that I got plastic surgery
all over my face.

787
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,307
I used to be very ugly,

788
00:59:19,407 --> 00:59:21,525
to the point that you can't even imagine.

789
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,127
So what?

790
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:27,097
So why...

791
00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:31,275
I have no idea why you're
attracted to someone like me.

792
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,969
"Someone like me"?

793
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:36,606
Because you are attractive.

794
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,214
It is partially because
you're physically attractive,

795
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:46,416
but my feelings for you
keep growing with time.

796
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,385
I just like you as who you are.

797
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:11,408
To me,

798
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,907
you're just yourself.

799
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:20,717
Coming home together
after that confession...

800
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,986
...makes me feel so awkward.

801
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,008
Go in.

802
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:32,707
Okay.

803
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,132
Good night.

804
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,838
Woo Young!

805
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,341
Woo Young.

806
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,343
Mi Rae.

807
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,248
- Woo Young.
- Yes, catch your breath first.

808
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,751
Well...

809
01:01:30,973 --> 01:01:33,440
You told me to think about it,

810
01:01:35,674 --> 01:01:37,060
but I...

811
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,074
I'm sorry.

812
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:49,306
All right.

813
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,075
I got your point.

814
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:54,377
I'm sorry.

815
01:01:54,474 --> 01:01:57,480
To be honest, I was
mentally prepared for this.

816
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,673
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

817
01:02:02,073 --> 01:02:03,740
You did nothing to be sorry for.

818
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,774
To tell you the truth,

819
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:09,659
I'm not sure if I can do this to you.

820
01:02:10,841 --> 01:02:12,622
Who am I to reject you?

821
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:14,041
You're at it again.

822
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,302
It's not like some people
don't deserve to be loved...

823
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:22,305
...or aren't allowed to be
attracted to someone.

824
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,608
There are no such rules.

825
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,977
And no one has the right to laugh at you.

826
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,757
Also,

827
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:32,649
when you're attracted to someone,

828
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,651
you can't control your feelings.

829
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,225
Good luck...

830
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:44,027
...with Kyung Seok.

831
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,133
I figured out a long time ago
that you two like each other.

832
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,435
But...

833
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,137
I still...

834
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:57,274
...wanted a chance to tell you
how I feel about you.

835
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,746
Kyung Seok is a good guy,
and he's handsome.

836
01:03:04,507 --> 01:03:06,082
No, it's not that.

837
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,186
You're handsome too.

838
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,722
That's really not the reason.

839
01:03:13,507 --> 01:03:16,693
You're such a wonderful person.

840
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,633
I'm fine. Don't cry.

841
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,782
Just go with your heart, Mi Rae.

842
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,008
So don't cry, okay?

843
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:17,387
