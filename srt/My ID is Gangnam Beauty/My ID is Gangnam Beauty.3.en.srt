1
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,112
Hey, gosh.

2
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,980
Hey, you flirted with me first.

3
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:30,989
How dare you act like
you don't know, wench?

4
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,451
Did you think things would work out
for real because I was nice to you?

5
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,169
Don't make me laugh. People like
you are everywhere in Gangnam.

6
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:40,338
Gosh, you plastic monster.

7
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:50,350
How dare you swear at me?

8
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:53,048
What did I do so wrong?

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,318
What did I do?

10
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,225
Why that crazy... Do you want to die?

11
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,118
That crazy wench. Hey!

12
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,218
It's you, Mi Rae.

13
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,682
Why are you sitting here alone?

14
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,017
Did you drink a lot?

15
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,212
Don't you remember me?

16
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:34,386
The TA?

17
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,114
Hello.

18
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,223
Is the frosh week party already over?

19
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,066
No.

20
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,133
Did something happen?

21
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:52,499
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

22
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:55,833
Do you want some water?

23
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:07,248
Have some water.

24
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:09,748
You're really pretty.

25
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:12,032
Gosh, you plastic monster.

26
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,000
It's okay.

27
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:18,832
Kang Mi Rae.

28
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,707
What are you doing here?

29
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,011
I'm heading home.

30
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,213
All right, then.

31
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,516
- Let's go.
- What was your name again?

32
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,918
Come on, let's go.

33
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,914
- What are you doing now?
- Mind your own business.

34
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,248
Why are you going with her? I
don't get what this is about.

35
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:44,833
What are you trying to do
with a girl who's drunk?

36
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,931
What on earth are you thinking?

37
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:53,006
You're the one who's trying to take her.

38
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,833
I don't know what kind of
relationship you have with her,

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,013
but do you know this can
be considered violence?

40
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,823
Cut it out. Let's go.

41
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,409
Let go.

42
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:15,775
I never say that you can grab my hand.

43
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:36,717
Thank you.

44
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:43,720
You didn't have to get me home.

45
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,231
We must make sure all
freshmen get home safely.

46
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,726
Why did you guys come? I'm totally fine.

47
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,821
Come on, we freshmen must
look after each other.

48
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,217
Hey, we came with her. You
had no reason to worry.

49
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,150
That's exactly why we were worried.

50
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:05,051
Then, get home safely. Thank you.

51
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:07,732
- Guys, get home safely.
- Okay.

52
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,817
- Go on in, Soo A.
- Bye.

53
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,419
Bye.

54
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,925
She lives here?

55
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,229
I thought she seemed very well-off.

56
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,231
Her family must be rich.

57
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,086
Don't make me laugh. People like
you are everywhere in Gangnam.

58
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,884
Gosh, you plastic monster.

59
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,399
I just wanted to be normal.

60
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,134
All I wanted was a normal
life like everyone else's.

61
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,833
Is it something that I can never have?

62
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,240
- What are you doing here?
- My gosh!

63
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,999
Why are you so surprised?

64
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,512
It's me. Don't you remember me?

65
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:15,315
Do I know you?

66
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,918
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,187
We met yesterday at the
club in Cheongdam-dong.

68
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,988
I guess you were really drunk.

69
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,381
I have no idea what
you're talking about now.

70
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:26,793
What's going on? Who is this guy?

71
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:29,095
I don't know.

72
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,099
Well, aren't you Yu Ri?

73
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,506
No, you got the wrong person.

74
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,909
I'm sorry. You look so much
like this girl I know.

75
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,415
Look carefully, will you?

76
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,681
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

77
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,882
My apologies.

78
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,487
What was that about?

79
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:57,090
Mi Rae, are you all right?

80
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,132
Someone called me a plastic monster.

81
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,470
What?

82
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:15,281
He said that girls like me
are everywhere in Gangnam.

83
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,699
Who said that? That jerk?

84
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:16,202
Hey, you should report him.

85
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,615
But I hit him too.

86
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,208
The one who attacks first
should be punished.

87
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,110
What started the fight though?

88
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,714
He calling me a plastic monster?
Or the remark about Gangnam?

89
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,617
I'll just end up with
another mean nickname.

90
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:32,399
This is crazy.

91
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,814
I got plastic surgery done to
enjoy what everyone else enjoys.

92
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,332
What's so wrong about it?

93
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:42,799
Do you think I was too greedy?

94
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,467
You know what? Was her name Hyun Soo A?
She's ridiculous too.

95
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,969
You said you two are close.

96
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,172
How could she say such a
thing in front of everyone?

97
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,875
She said she didn't know.

98
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,377
Whatever.

99
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,080
What if someone else asks me
if I got work done on my face?

100
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,782
I should just tell the truth, right?

101
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:06,098
If you lie and say that
you got nothing done...

102
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,688
You'll look obnoxious.

103
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,814
Then shall I tell people that I
only got my eyes and nose done?

104
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:16,396
Gosh, no. That makes it sound
like you wanted to get more done.

105
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,814
Take out "only". Just say you
got your eyes and nose done.

106
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,002
My, you sure are a psychology major.

107
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:26,506
How about I tell them about the face
contouring surgery and all else?

108
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,299
No, that's not necessary.

109
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:31,411
Right?

110
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,615
Getting plastic surgery isn't
something to brag about.

111
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,481
Hey, you should still be confident.

112
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,581
Just don't overreact.

113
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,299
Yes, I know.

114
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,798
They'll probably look down on
me if I cause a fuss about it.

115
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,494
People looked down on
me because I was ugly.

116
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,796
And now, they'll look down on me
because I got plastic surgery.

117
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm not ugly nor pretty.

118
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,370
But then, I'm not normal either.

119
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,399
I don't even know myself anymore.

120
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,814
I don't know which category
I should adjust myself to.

121
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:09,814
If you have to choose, you should
adjust yourself to being pretty.

122
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,081
Don't you remember?

123
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:14,465
Some guy told you that you're his
ideal type at the orientation.

124
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:17,598
That's probably because
he thought I was easy.

125
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,433
Forget it.

126
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,532
Drink up.

127
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,138
Mom.

128
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,943
Goodness, you came to pick me up.

129
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:43,615
Hello?

130
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,718
Ma'am, are you back in Korea?

131
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,403
You said you'll be back tomorrow.

132
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,090
We were going to go pick you up.

133
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,281
That's why I came early.

134
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:54,360
You need to let us do
the least we can do...

135
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:56,378
...to make us feel comfortable.

136
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,264
There's no need.

137
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,166
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

138
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,358
- Do Sang Won...
- Do Sang Won...

139
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:24,891
- will support your future!
- Will support your future!

140
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,348
You should play these kind of
songs to attract young people.

141
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:31,931
Trot songs are no longer
effective in Seoul.

142
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,048
Are you telling me to
dance like you just did?

143
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:36,436
No. If you dance throughout
the entire song,

144
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,148
people will think you
only practiced dancing...

145
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,739
...instead of focusing on making policies.

146
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,841
So you just need to
dance to the highlight.

147
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,144
Do you guys think this is a good idea?

148
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:49,732
I'll leave the dancing to the promoters.

149
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,813
It'd be nice to have Kyung
Seok stand beside you.

150
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:02,495
But his birthday hasn't passed yet.

151
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:05,999
Ah Reum is known for being pretty
among all the politician's children.

152
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,401
But compared to Kyung Seok,
she's more like a squid.

153
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,004
Can you refrain from using
those kind of terms?

154
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,014
I'm saying you need to focus on
the young voters in order to win.

155
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:17,210
If you become the mayor, your next
goal will be to become a governor.

156
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,745
And then...

157
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,115
Congressman Do, you have a phone call.

158
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,315
Who's calling?

159
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,418
She's the head of Hankook Kelun.

160
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,076
Hello?

161
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,706
It's been a while. I'm back in Korea.

162
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,907
I know.

163
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:44,932
I know we're not close enough to ask
each other how we've been doing.

164
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,364
So I'll just cut to the chase.

165
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,742
Please tell Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee...

166
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,148
...that I wish to meet them.

167
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,947
Why would you meet them? You
don't deserve to see them.

168
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,017
I didn't call to ask you
for your permission.

169
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,487
I'm only trying to keep my manners
since you raised the kids until now.

170
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,090
I'm going to meet my kids,
so just keep that in mind.

171
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,396
She must be out of her mind.

172
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,615
Can you get up for a second?

173
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:53,022
There are so many men
who wish to date you.

174
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,831
So I figured I should make you
mine as soon as possible.

175
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,510
Because you're my girl.

176
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,432
- Do you want to die?
- I'm sorry.

177
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:02,448
I was out of line, right?

178
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,366
Should I take a break this semester?

179
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,856
What? Are you going to go to the army?

180
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,159
Didn't I tell you last time?

181
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,032
You're the type who goes to the army
after breaking up with someone.

182
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:20,633
But you didn't even date anyone yet.
So why would you take a break?

183
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:23,936
Hi, you guys.

184
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:26,406
Why aren't you guys heading to class?

185
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,080
You have really long legs.

186
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:34,981
What?

187
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,881
I'll see you later.

188
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:38,985
Okay.

189
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,593
I guess...

190
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,475
...nothing really happened between
you and Soo A last night.

191
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,100
Am I correct?

192
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,315
Why do you think she said,
"I'll see you later"?

193
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,502
She meant she'll see us in class.

194
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,799
I do have long legs.

195
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,077
When did she have the time to notice that?

196
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,680
I think you should go to the
army to get to your senses.

197
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,632
I don't understand Soo A.

198
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:21,732
She should've gotten the message...

199
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:23,881
...when she saw Mi Rae
hesitating to answer.

200
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,682
Mi Rae obviously got her
eyelids done and a nose job.

201
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,766
Soo A's so slow-witted.

202
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,033
Don't you want to know...

203
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:35,675
...how Mi Rae used to look in the past?

204
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,677
Ye Na.

205
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:40,715
Hello.

206
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,682
Hi.

207
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:43,828
Kyung Seok.

208
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,826
Can we talk?

209
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,312
He's talking with me right now.

210
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,433
I'm sorry. I need to talk to him
regarding a class we're taking.

211
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:59,699
We're in the same research team.
He's the leader. I'm the assistant.

212
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,889
Okay, then. I'll see you later.

213
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:05,465
By the way, Ye Na.

214
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,331
You have chili powder stuck
in between your teeth.

215
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,545
Gosh, what am I going to do?

216
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:34,499
Don't you want to know how Mi
Rae used to look in the past?

217
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,794
Shouldn't we resolve our misunderstanding?

218
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:48,032
We're in the same research team.

219
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,666
I apologized to Mi Rae yesterday.

220
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,800
Mi Rae told me that she was fine.

221
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,165
But I still felt really sorry.

222
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:03,233
She must've been so flustered.

223
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,966
Every time I saw Mi Rae,

224
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:12,232
I was always envious of
how pretty she looked.

225
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,866
I said that because I didn't know
she had received plastic surgery.

226
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:19,448
I'm so slow-witted.

227
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,565
Then why did you ask?

228
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,415
What?

229
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,499
If you didn't know she
got plastic surgery,

230
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:29,100
why did you ask her if she did or not?

231
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:34,598
I just...

232
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,270
...said that without really
thinking much about it.

233
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,833
You don't seem that dumb.

234
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:45,032
Did you tell Chan Woo that you
like him without thinking as well?

235
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,165
But then again, you might
actually like him.

236
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:52,665
Well...

237
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,999
I just wanted the seniors to like me.

238
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,833
Do you have more to say?

239
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,166
What are you guys doing?

240
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:04,765
We were talking about last night.

241
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,298
What happened? Did Kyung Seok apologize?

242
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,881
Yes, kind of.

243
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:19,532
I guess he was bothered
by how he treated you.

244
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:25,499
I told him that I'm okay and
that he shouldn't worry.

245
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:28,566
Something's fishy.

246
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,114
What?

247
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:32,899
He could've purposely caused trouble
so that he can see you in private.

248
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:35,866
Do you think he's just
pretending to be cold?

249
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,431
You know how people sometimes act
cold just so they could be nice?

250
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,366
Why would he do that?

251
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:42,828
I guess you're right. He's not Won Ho.

252
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:45,281
But if Kyung Seok asks you out,

253
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,281
I don't think you'll
be able to reject him.

254
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,368
- You're the one who's weird.
- What?

255
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,471
You seem very interested in Kyung Seok.

256
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,173
Do you like him?

257
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,676
What are you talking about?

258
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,478
I prefer guys who are more
nice and approachable.

259
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,299
Kyung Seok is way too cold-blooded.
He's ice cold.

260
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,708
But seriously, why are you so slow-witted?

261
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,199
How can you think Mi Rae
didn't get plastic surgery?

262
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,600
It's so obvious.

263
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,033
- Didn't she get too much done?
- I know, right? It's a bit much.

264
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,415
- Seriously?
- She just stared at us.

265
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:43,466
- Gangnam Beauty.
- Yes, the typical Gangnam face.

266
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,062
So this happened again.

267
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:51,764
Again.

268
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,632
(Kang Mi Rae)

269
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:14,933
Why are you here?

270
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:18,802
What? I'm in this class.

271
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,132
Are you the overly self-conscious type?

272
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,081
Spare me a minute.

273
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,637
Let's talk.

274
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,240
You somehow keep getting
involved in my problems.

275
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,902
I hope you can stop overreacting.

276
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:07,778
With the TA and Soo A too.

277
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:12,635
Don't get the wrong idea about Soo A.
She really didn't know.

278
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:22,075
Anyone could tell that I got work
done on my face, but anyway...

279
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:23,489
Why did you do it?

280
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,309
What?

281
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,809
Why did you get plastic surgery...

282
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,843
...on your face?

283
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,824
It's okay, Jung Boon.

284
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,290
I can do it by myself.

285
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:43,868
Don't be like that. We should take turns.

286
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,785
It's not like being top of
the class is a penalty.

287
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:55,082
Hey, you're the freshmen
representative, right?

288
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,388
Yes.

289
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:00,377
What do you mean why I
got plastic surgery?

290
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,843
Why are you even asking?

291
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,177
You know that I had no choice
but to get plastic surgery.

292
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,041
What exactly do you mean by that?

293
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,910
Who says plastic surgery is a
must for some and not for others?

294
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,277
Well, I just meant that...

295
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:25,109
You know what I used to look like.

296
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:30,741
I never even dreamed of
becoming as pretty as Soo A is.

297
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:34,177
Not even Ji Hyo.

298
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,120
I would've been happy with
looking like Jung Boon or Eun.

299
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:40,633
Had I looked like them, I would've
never gotten anything done.

300
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:44,643
But my face was far below
the average, you know.

301
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,210
Do you...

302
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,576
...grade other people's faces?

303
00:21:56,542 --> 00:22:00,043
It sounds like what needed surgery
was your unhealthy mindset.

304
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:10,319
What did you just say?

305
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,034
It's none of your business.

306
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:19,010
Why do you even care about what I think?

307
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:35,621
That jerk. What does he even know?
He has no clue.

308
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:50,631
It sounds like what needed surgery
was your unhealthy mindset.

309
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,173
What did you say?

310
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,509
Kyung Seok, where are you going?
Are you headed home?

311
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:02,958
Yes.

312
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,824
I must say, you're so gutsy.

313
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,653
The seniors told us to gather,
but you totally ignored it.

314
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,642
You're brave.

315
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:13,344
- Why do they want us to gather?
- You didn't know about it?

316
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,761
Don't you check the group chat?

317
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,163
Kim Chan Woo told all
freshmen to assemble.

318
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,943
I wonder what he's up to this time.

319
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,910
Did one of us do something
wrong yesterday?

320
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,643
He must've told the girls
to assemble too, right?

321
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,943
I wonder if Soo A is coming.

322
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,758
Gosh, he should be embarrassed
that he hasn't graduated yet.

323
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,749
Why did he come to the frosh week party?

324
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,476
I'll say something to him.
Gosh, what a hassle.

325
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:43,559
Hey, you flirted with me first.

326
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,758
How dare you act like
you don't know, wench?

327
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,460
Did you think things would work out
for real because I was nice to you?

328
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,243
Don't make me laugh. People like
you are everywhere in Gangnam.

329
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:58,643
It must be because of me.

330
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,243
I bet he wants to get back at me.

331
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,443
(Choi Jung Boon)

332
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,810
Hey, Jung Boon.

333
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,076
Yes, I saw it.

334
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,303
He said that he'll teach
us a serious lesson.

335
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,218
I have no idea what it's about.

336
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:24,271
Well, Eun didn't do anything wrong.

337
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,476
Do you guys think I'm a joke?

338
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,042
Where's everyone else?

339
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:45,890
Well, many have already gone home.

340
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:48,520
You guys are the rudest freshmen
in the school's entire history.

341
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,222
Do you know that, you jerks?

342
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,043
Is Do Kyung Seok not here?

343
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,141
I told you that it's all
of your responsibility.

344
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:04,724
Get ready for some real punishment.
You're all dead meat.

345
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:07,940
Gosh, has he lost his mind? Why
do we have to get punished?

346
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:09,742
All of you, in push-up position.

347
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,576
- Sorry?
- I said, in push-up position!

348
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,046
Do I have to repeat myself?

349
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:15,748
Gosh, you little...

350
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,842
Chan Woo, Chan Woo!

351
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:22,876
- What is it? Why are you here?
- What are you doing now?

352
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:25,809
What will you do if someone records
and posts a video of this?

353
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:32,676
All of you, run over there
in 10 seconds. Now.

354
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,956
And all of you must give your phone
to Jung Ho with no exception.

355
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,949
Hold on to my bag and be on the watch.

356
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:45,577
- That crazy jerk.
- He'll hear.

357
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:50,910
Hurry up!

358
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,210
Assume push-up position!

359
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,743
What?

360
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:03,843
Is the space too tight?

361
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:09,758
All of you girls can leave.

362
00:26:09,842 --> 00:26:12,042
I never punish girls.

363
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:13,943
Get out!

364
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:25,642
Except for you, Kang Mi Rae.

365
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:31,573
Girls, who think they're pretty
despite all the work they got done,

366
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,014
need a serious lesson.

367
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,910
Your face is a reflection of your heart.

368
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,843
Am I wrong? Answer me.

369
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:43,797
Then I'll stay too.

370
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,776
What?

371
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,925
I'll stay here with her.

372
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,409
Soo A, why...

373
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:56,292
This has nothing to do with you.
Why would you do that for her?

374
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,474
Then what did I do wrong?

375
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,285
What did you just say?

376
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,388
And what did these guys do wrong?

377
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:06,576
Guys, leave us.

378
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,376
Get out!

379
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:22,106
You should really be begging
me for forgiveness.

380
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:24,648
How dare you say that
you've done nothing wrong?

381
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:29,210
Shall I make your face go
back to how it used to look?

382
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,025
- Don't do this, Chan Woo.
- Get lost!

383
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,925
- Chan Woo, calm down.
- Gosh, shut your mouth.

384
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:34,743
- Chan Woo, please.
- Hey.

385
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:37,943
Get out, all of you. Get out!

386
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,329
Hey.

387
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:48,908
You're the one who told all
freshmen to call me SOJ, right?

388
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:50,302
It was you, wasn't it?

389
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:52,604
I know it was you!

390
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,776
You and Do Kyung Seok are the
most arrogant ones in your year.

391
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:04,383
Fine, I'll punish you for Kyung
Seok not showing up as well.

392
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:06,885
Hey.

393
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,754
Hey.

394
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,561
You crazy jerk.

395
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,510
You must be out of your mind.

396
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:25,370
I'm going to kill you today.

397
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:27,909
Let go of this. Let go!

398
00:28:41,576 --> 00:28:43,110
Are you okay?

399
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,401
- Hey, give me your cell phone.
- My gosh.

400
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:08,210
Hurry.

401
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,193
(Chemistry Department
Office, TA: Yeon Woo Young)

402
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:15,810
Come in.

403
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:20,092
Hi. Please sit down.

404
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:26,064
It's hard being the head of
all the freshmen, isn't it?

405
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,667
No, it's okay.

406
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:34,609
I just heard that something happened.

407
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:36,775
Can you tell me everything
including all the details?

408
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:43,876
Yes.

409
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,509
Yes, I think I'll be sleeping there.

410
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,908
Make sure to lock your
door before you sleep.

411
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:55,443
Okay, bye.

412
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:40,229
It's been four months.

413
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:44,383
Tae Sik, you've done enough.

414
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:47,990
If you want a child to
look exactly like you,

415
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,098
I'll give birth to another baby.

416
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:54,897
- Mom.
- What are you doing here?

417
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:56,198
Don't you have class tomorrow?

418
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,799
I'll just get up a little early.

419
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,798
Here. I bought you dumplings.

420
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,706
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

421
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,632
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

422
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:10,299
Where's Dad?

423
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:14,312
He went to the funeral
of his friend's father.

424
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,714
Does that mean he's not coming home?

425
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:18,432
Probably.

426
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:25,994
He's feeling a lot better
now, so don't worry too much.

427
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,398
Really?

428
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,114
Yes, he's almost over it.

429
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,905
Are you here because
something bad happened?

430
00:31:37,306 --> 00:31:40,309
No, everything's fine.

431
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,010
I'm going to take a shower.

432
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:43,412
Okay.

433
00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:51,814
Why did you bring your car?
We're going to drink.

434
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:53,327
I'll just call a chauffeur service.

435
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,747
Gosh, you live nearby. That's
such a waste of money.

436
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:58,734
Please give us a lot of side dishes.

437
00:31:58,818 --> 00:32:01,401
He'll be buying tonight because his
daughter goes to Hankook University.

438
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:02,401
Okay.

439
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,499
Show me some photos of Mi
Rae's entrance ceremony.

440
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:06,201
She goes to the most prestigious
university in the neighborhood.

441
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,602
I don't have any photos.

442
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,004
Didn't you take any?

443
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:11,119
My wife took photos with her cell phone.

444
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:13,734
Then ask her to send them to you.

445
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,711
Let's just drink. Here.

446
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:20,535
Isn't Mi Rae going to take us
on a tour around the campus?

447
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:23,018
That's a good idea. We
should pay her a visit.

448
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,401
We should use this chance to take
a look around Hankook University.

449
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,122
University students are busy.

450
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:29,524
She doesn't even have time to come home.

451
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:31,226
My gosh, you punk.

452
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,930
Look at how arrogant he's being just
because Mi Rae's back in Korea.

453
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,732
You used to always boast about her.

454
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,134
But now, you're not even
talking about her as much.

455
00:32:39,818 --> 00:32:41,535
- I'm going to leave.
- Gosh, stop.

456
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:44,220
- Look at him.
- I was kidding.

457
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:46,041
- Let's drink.
- He gets upset so easily.

458
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:48,443
I'm buying you drinks.
Come on, let's just drink.

459
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:52,234
- Come on.
- Congratulations.

460
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:55,434
I can't believe she's a student
at Hankook University.

461
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,285
I knew she'd get in.

462
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:06,862
You're a star, Mi Rae.

463
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,867
Gosh, stop watching it and sleep.

464
00:33:13,654 --> 00:33:15,888
I'm going to watch it
again by myself tomorrow.

465
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,748
Are you having fun at school?

466
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:29,851
It's not bad.

467
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:31,453
My gosh.

468
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,685
I guess the money was worth it.

469
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,292
They're finally seeing...

470
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:40,662
...your true value now
that you look pretty.

471
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:45,200
What's my true value?

472
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,700
You're cute, bright,

473
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:52,984
nice, and cheerful.

474
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,858
You were cheerful ever
since you were a baby.

475
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,406
On your first birthday, you
danced the night away.

476
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,988
Everyone thought you'd grow
up and become a celebrity.

477
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,757
Now,

478
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,173
you should make a lot of friends...

479
00:34:16,257 --> 00:34:18,691
...and have lots of fun.

480
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:20,839
Enjoy your life.

481
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,106
It'll be the best years of your life.

482
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:31,856
Mom, I'm sleepy.

483
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:36,523
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

484
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,090
You need to wake up early
for school tomorrow.

485
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,710
Look at you acting like a baby after
hearing about your first birthday.

486
00:35:03,912 --> 00:35:08,216
Mom, you must've had a hard
time because of me until now.

487
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,687
Life...

488
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:17,092
...is all about fighting
through your struggles.

489
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:21,575
People might seem like they're
living a worry-free life.

490
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,691
But they're all just trying
their best to keep living.

491
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,476
I like how you smell, Mom.

492
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,223
Gosh, you're so sensitive to smell.

493
00:35:38,357 --> 00:35:40,048
My cute little baby.

494
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:45,523
I'm so glad to hear that
you're doing well in school.

495
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,250
Sir, you can't enter
because you drank alcohol.

496
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:04,072
You have one new message.

497
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:08,076
Tae Sik, you've done enough.

498
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,473
If you want a child to
look exactly like you,

499
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,382
I'll give birth to another baby.

500
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:18,506
- Mom.
- What are you doing here?

501
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,806
Don't you have class tomorrow?

502
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,391
I'll just get up a little early.

503
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:24,392
Here. I bought you dumplings.

504
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:28,424
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

505
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:32,234
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

506
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:33,702
Where's Dad?

507
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:41,323
(Voice message)

508
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,357
Do you know a freshman beat up his
senior who's five years older?

509
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,324
Really?

510
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,932
The senior flew from the first
bathroom stall to the last.

511
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,238
That means he at least flew...

512
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,935
- ...for about 8 m.
- Exactly.

513
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:09,440
- The fight ended in two seconds.
- Come on.

514
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:10,656
He dodged the mop,

515
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,473
and did a full 360
turn, then kicked him.

516
00:37:13,558 --> 00:37:14,870
- Have you heard?
- What?

517
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,640
His jaw and ribs are all broken.

518
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,173
- Seriously?
- Isn't it crazy?

519
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:19,955
- That is crazy.
- My gosh.

520
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:24,452
Shouldn't we persuade him to
transfer to our department?

521
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,124
What's his name?

522
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,672
What was it? Was it Do Kyung Seok?

523
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,557
- Do Kyung Seok?
- Do Kyung Seok.

524
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,464
Why did he show up when I
was just about to kick him?

525
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,467
Just enlist in the military.

526
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,572
(Here's a mop flower.)

527
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:46,374
If I were him, I'd drop out of school.

528
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:49,978
Get it out of my face.

529
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,316
By the way, why did he
do that to Kang Mi Rae?

530
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:56,718
It's not like SOJ does things
like that for reasons.

531
00:37:56,823 --> 00:37:59,724
I guess he wanted to have some fun
with her, but it didn't go well.

532
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,223
But still, how could Kyung
Seok do that to a senior?

533
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:03,625
Do you call a mop your senior?

534
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,214
He does not deserve our respect.

535
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:07,637
So is Mop his new nickname now?

536
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,613
Let's be honest. Isn't it so gratifying?

537
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:13,258
My, I'd love to be as
gutsy as Kyung Seok is.

538
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:17,005
Even everything he does melts my heart.

539
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:23,424
Is she not coming to class today?
Shall I try calling her?

540
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:27,457
We still have some time
until the class starts.

541
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:33,664
What if worse things happen?

542
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:36,891
What if Kyung Seok gets
in trouble because of me?

543
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:39,257
Mi Rae!

544
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,157
Are you okay?

545
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:52,674
Everyone thinks that Kim
Chan Woo is a total jerk,

546
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:54,275
so don't worry.

547
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,991
I shouldn't have told everyone to come.

548
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:00,217
I'm sorry.

549
00:39:00,383 --> 00:39:03,099
I deeply regretted just standing
there and doing nothing.

550
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:05,908
I should've spoken up no
matter how scared I was.

551
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:09,585
Don't say that. I know
that you had no choice.

552
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:13,105
I'm the one who should apologize.
It was all because of me.

553
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,824
Hey, that is not true.

554
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,891
It's my fault for not doing a
good job as our representative.

555
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,058
I'm sorry, Mi Rae.

556
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:25,590
You must've been terrified.

557
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:29,050
I felt so bad that I couldn't
even sleep last night.

558
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,907
Kim Chan Woo, that jerk. We should
have taught him a real lesson.

559
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,339
That's what I'm saying. We should've
rubbed the mop all over his face.

560
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,640
- I'm Kim Sung Woon.
- 80 out of 100.

561
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:40,950
I'd give her 85...

562
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:42,617
- when she's dressed up.
- I'm Lee Ji Hyo.

563
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,916
Gosh, I told you guys
to just talk casually.

564
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,045
- I'm Choi Jung Boon.
- 70 out of 100?

565
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,931
- She has a cute, friendly face.
- Are you the one that created...

566
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:52,858
Totally.

567
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,161
They're such nice people.
What on earth was I thinking?

568
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,833
I judged them by their looks
and graded their faces.

569
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,924
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,657
For what?

571
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:14,190
And thank you both so much.

572
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,824
I just did what anyone would've
done in that situation.

573
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:24,390
It's not easy to volunteer to stay
behind with me in that situation.

574
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,557
I couldn't leave you alone in there.
We're friends, you know.

575
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:34,090
To tell you the truth, I felt
like I owed you an apology.

576
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:37,223
I wondered if Chan Woo was
taking things out on you...

577
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,790
...because of me.

578
00:40:41,123 --> 00:40:44,546
He actually told me that he likes me,

579
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,523
but I rejected him because
it made me so uncomfortable.

580
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:50,672
The thing is, he asked me
if it was because of you.

581
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:53,257
He totally jumped to his own conclusions.

582
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,424
Then did you babble on to Soo
A to hit me in the back?

583
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:00,690
She says she can't go out
with me because you like me.

584
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:03,705
- What did I do?
- What did you do?

585
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:06,205
Hey, you flirted with me first.

586
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,490
How dare you act like
you don't know, wench?

587
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:15,972
That's why I thought he
was taking it out on you.

588
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:18,324
I felt so bad.

589
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,473
No, you did nothing wrong.

590
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:24,957
You obviously had to
reject a jerk like him.

591
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:29,406
Now, everyone calls him
Mop instead of SOJ.

592
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,122
Really? I think that
nickname suits him better.

593
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:37,330
I must say, Mi Rae is quite brave.
She spoke up in that situation.

594
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:40,031
Whatever. Soo A was the brave one.

595
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,035
I'm impressed that she stood up
for Mi Rae in that situation.

596
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,939
My gosh. She's pretty, and she's
such a loyal friend as well.

597
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:49,757
She's pretty and thoughtful.

598
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:52,790
I didn't even do much.

599
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,115
Frankly, Kyung Seok was the one
who really came to your rescue.

600
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,790
I must say, it seems like he
gives you special treatment.

601
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:10,424
- Aren't I right?
- What do you mean?

602
00:42:10,584 --> 00:42:13,351
Are you two going out by any chance?

603
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:14,966
What?

604
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:18,991
Hey, I heard Kang Mi Rae
came to school today.

605
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:21,005
- Seriously?
- Yes.

606
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,307
I thought she'd take a few days off.

607
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,023
She's much stronger than I thought.

608
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,273
The time when I made that mistake
at our frosh week party...

609
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:39,124
...and this time too.

610
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,560
It's almost as if he can't stand
seeing you in difficult situations.

611
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:44,722
Well, that's...

612
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,705
Are you two still testing the waters?

613
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:49,067
What? It's really not what you think.

614
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,772
No? But I've seen the two of you
talking about your secrets.

615
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:55,173
Secrets? When?

616
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,406
That day in front of the vending machine.

617
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,091
When you were with Eun and Jung Boon.

618
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:04,515
- Thanks for this.
- Mi Rae.

619
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,358
Let's have a quick talk.

620
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:18,830
What's going on? A secret chat
between just the two of you?

621
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,506
That was about my perfume container...

622
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,391
Kyung Seok must've confessed
his feelings for you.

623
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:31,047
Does he have a one-sided crush on you?

624
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:33,152
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

625
00:43:33,253 --> 00:43:35,646
That's because we're alumni...

626
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:37,490
I must be out of my mind.

627
00:43:38,923 --> 00:43:42,253
Alumni? Did you guys
go to the same school?

628
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:46,557
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

629
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:48,357
I had no idea.

630
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:50,678
Which school? High school, I assume?

631
00:43:50,763 --> 00:43:52,524
No, middle school.

632
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:56,294
I asked Kyung Seok not to tell anyone...

633
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,991
...and ended up exposing my past myself.

634
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:10,768
Well, I told you that wench,
Kang Mi Rae, hit me first.

635
00:44:10,887 --> 00:44:14,004
Do you believe the freshmen's
words over my words?

636
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,386
Hey, Chan Woo.

637
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,690
Regardless of the reason,

638
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,094
if you bother freshmen once again,

639
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,290
I'm going to do my best
to ruin your future.

640
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,698
You got that?

641
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,940
I'm going to talk to
every single freshman...

642
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:32,759
...and expose every bad deed you've done.

643
00:44:32,956 --> 00:44:35,605
I'll make sure you get no reference
letter when you graduate.

644
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,506
Even if you manage to get a job
without a reference letter,

645
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,590
I'll tell our alumni in the field
about everything you've done,

646
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,714
so brace yourself.

647
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,558
You know I can do anything
I set my mind to.

648
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,387
Hey, but still... We're friends.

649
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:52,291
The fact that we're friends...

650
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:56,457
...embarrasses me so much.

651
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,524
I really can't stand it.

652
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:03,791
I'm sorry.

653
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:06,890
You can leave now.

654
00:45:34,956 --> 00:45:36,373
- Hey.
- Have you eaten yet?

655
00:45:36,457 --> 00:45:37,467
- All right.
- What?

656
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:39,000
What?

657
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,209
Shall we eat together?

658
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:50,623
It's on me.

659
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,550
Why?

660
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,541
Because I owe you.

661
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,075
You owe me?

662
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:59,139
I'll have stir-fried spicy pork.
What will you have?

663
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:02,024
You just pressed a button for pork cutlet.

664
00:46:04,357 --> 00:46:06,258
(Stir-fried spicy pork)

665
00:46:13,824 --> 00:46:15,607
- Awesome.
- Goodness.

666
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:16,739
Did you find out just now?

667
00:46:16,823 --> 00:46:18,872
I didn't know either.

668
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:22,106
It's not a big issue, so why
didn't she tell us about it?

669
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,724
I know.

670
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:27,239
- Hi.
- Guys, check this out.

671
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:29,705
Mi Rae and Kyung Seok came
from the same middle school.

672
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:30,705
Is that right?

673
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,623
I knew it.

674
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,201
That must be why Kyung Seok
got all worked up yesterday.

675
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:39,108
But I don't think they were that close.

676
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:41,698
I heard he transferred to
another middle school.

677
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:43,406
It's not like they aren't close either.

678
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:45,702
I saw them have a meal together.

679
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:46,735
By themselves?

680
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:48,921
Yes, I just saw them in the cafeteria.

681
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:51,034
Seeing how he's so attentive towards her,

682
00:46:51,118 --> 00:46:54,111
I guess Mi Rae wasn't that
bad even before her surgery.

683
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,314
Maybe he had a crush on her in the past.

684
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,215
No way.

685
00:46:58,352 --> 00:46:59,934
I'm 100 percent sure about it.

686
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:01,352
You have a point.

687
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,223
Are you forcing yourself to eat pork
cutlet when you don't want to...

688
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:07,525
...because of me?

689
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:08,626
No.

690
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:17,914
When you said you owed me,
was it about Kim Chan Woo?

691
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,870
Yes.

692
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:23,590
Thank you.

693
00:47:27,524 --> 00:47:29,229
I thought you'd be mad.

694
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:30,581
What is it that you want to say?

695
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,891
I hate myself for being like this too.

696
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:38,707
Judging people by their looks...

697
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,391
...and labeling them.

698
00:47:42,023 --> 00:47:43,507
People like you who are considered cool...

699
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:46,158
...even when they don't
follow the rules...

700
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:48,659
...wouldn't understand a life like mine.

701
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:55,406
I'm sorry...

702
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,791
...for talking harshly to you.

703
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:04,092
You know, what I said about your mindset.

704
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:06,984
I'm sorry about that.

705
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,324
Well...

706
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,490
What you said about me wasn't wrong.

707
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:19,158
By the way, do people think I'm cool?

708
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:21,599
Who said that?

709
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,605
Is that what you think?

710
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:28,906
No.

711
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,877
Let's be honest. You were
popular back in middle school.

712
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,078
Don't you know?

713
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,981
I guess I was.

714
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:40,783
You're annoying.

715
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:42,667
- Hey.
- What?

716
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:45,167
Have you usually thought I was annoying?

717
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:47,448
No, sorry.

718
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,191
I was just asking.

719
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:51,440
- Are you intimidated again?
- What?

720
00:48:51,524 --> 00:48:53,758
You keep getting intimidated for nothing.

721
00:48:55,624 --> 00:48:57,558
When did I?

722
00:48:58,057 --> 00:49:00,758
I'm not the type who
easily gets intimidated.

723
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:03,991
Then live the way you originally are.

724
00:49:12,023 --> 00:49:15,957
(Recruiting part-timers)

725
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:18,567
I've got my health certificate.

726
00:49:18,674 --> 00:49:21,341
I can start working right away.

727
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:26,626
It's great. Everything is nice,

728
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:30,113
but your dialect is a bit...

729
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,805
I can fix it right away.

730
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,507
It's quite hard to fix your dialect.

731
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:38,939
No, I'm very good at
speaking in Seoul dialect.

732
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:40,507
- Look.
- Yes?

733
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:42,806
Isn't there a pretty
girl in your department?

734
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,822
Who?

735
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:44,906
Was her name Hyun Soo A?

736
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,224
Soo A?

737
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:51,358
Isn't she interested in working part-time?

738
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:58,062
I'm Hyun Soo A, and I'm a freshman
of chemistry major in Hankook.

739
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,757
I see.

740
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:03,858
I might not be good at working
since it's my first time.

741
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:06,224
But I'll work hard and learn quickly.

742
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:08,040
There's nothing much to learn.

743
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:11,224
Right now is good enough.

744
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:13,544
- What?
- Just...

745
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:15,112
as you are.

746
00:50:17,424 --> 00:50:19,416
Can you start working from tomorrow?

747
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:22,425
Oh, thank you.

748
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:30,173
Getting scholarship is the best
thing you can do for your parents.

749
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:32,696
Let's go out.

750
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:42,040
Really? Kyung Seok
apologized to you first?

751
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:43,558
Yes.

752
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,758
Hey.

753
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:20,933
Are you wearing perfume?

754
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:25,441
Maybe you were mistaken about him.

755
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:27,816
He might not have laughed at you.

756
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:30,244
Even if that's the case,

757
00:51:30,335 --> 00:51:32,917
he definitely asked me about
the perfume to pick on me.

758
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,341
I guess he became nice as he grew up.

759
00:51:36,557 --> 00:51:39,690
He didn't tell others that you came
from the same middle school, either.

760
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,424
Let's go in.

761
00:51:45,491 --> 00:51:48,973
I don't fully get the situation,
but I'm sure he's on your side,

762
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:51,257
judging by how he taught
the senior a lesson.

763
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,203
What is it?

764
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:00,584
Is this for real?

765
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,287
I won a ticket to the
perfume sampling event.

766
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,922
Gosh, I thought it was
about something serious.

767
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:08,225
Hey, it's awfully hard to win this ticket.

768
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,540
I can bring another person with me.

769
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:12,740
- Let's go together.
- No.

770
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:14,573
"Guest performance by Junoflo"?

771
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:17,291
Are you serious? Give me that.

772
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,391
It's for real. Hey, take me there.

773
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:22,507
You must go with me, okay?

774
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:24,240
You have no one else to go with anyway.

775
00:52:24,355 --> 00:52:26,171
- You said you wouldn't go.
- Yes, I must go.

776
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:28,283
Take me for certain, okay?

777
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:29,747
I'll be good to you.

778
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:32,983
Kyung Seok.

779
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,086
I heard you and Mi Rae went
to the same middle school.

780
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:39,941
Who said that?

781
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:41,558
Mi Rae.

782
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,663
Soo A said that she heard it from Mi Rae.

783
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:49,833
Why? Is it a secret?

784
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:57,058
What was that? Does he think I
speak to him because I like him?

785
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,078
Pay for this one too.

786
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,284
Did he just force us to pay for him?

787
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,786
Why that little...

788
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,789
He hasn't come to his senses yet.

789
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,992
Should I teach him a lesson?

790
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:18,625
I can teach him a better
lesson than Kyung Seok.

791
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:22,367
Please wait.

792
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,780
Didn't you say you'd treat me?

793
00:53:27,357 --> 00:53:29,573
- Hello.
- I'll pay for theirs too.

794
00:53:36,142 --> 00:53:37,158
Thank you for the food.

795
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:40,049
- Thank you.
- No problem.

796
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:43,509
That's the true example of a senior.

797
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:55,225
Annoying punk.

798
00:53:57,057 --> 00:53:59,277
A heated flask is extremely hot.

799
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:01,407
You must not touch it with your hands.

800
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:03,073
One student almost went blind...

801
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:04,774
...by having heated acid splattered
on his eye in the past,

802
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:06,792
so be extra careful.

803
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:10,280
A member of each group should come
out and take the equipment now.

804
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:16,140
Those female students with
long hair must tie it up.

805
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,354
Okay.

806
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:57,327
Didn't you ask me not to tell others?

807
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:58,629
What?

808
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,257
They know that we went to the same school.

809
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:06,758
I know. They somehow found out.

810
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:12,040
We converted the volume of Reactant A...

811
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:14,439
...to the mole of A.

812
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,640
Don't you think Soo A and Kyung
Seok look great together?

813
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:20,991
Then we calculated the volume
of Reactant B that's needed.

814
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:23,957
Watch what you say in front of me.

815
00:55:37,552 --> 00:55:42,372
Heat it in the boiling water.

816
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,077
Goodness.

817
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:53,891
- Did you burn your hand?
- No.

818
00:55:54,124 --> 00:55:55,085
Let me see.

819
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,990
- I'm okay.
- And why are you hiding it?

820
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,025
Are you hurt?

821
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,095
- No, I just brushed up against it.
- Let me see.

822
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,498
- What happened?
- Did she get hurt?

823
00:56:08,724 --> 00:56:09,707
Oh, no.

824
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,292
- You have to be careful.
- Oh, no.

825
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,509
It seems okay, but make sure you
cool it down with cold water.

826
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,611
Okay.

827
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,313
I clearly told you not to touch the
hot flask directly with your hands.

828
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:25,215
I'm sorry.

829
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,024
It applies to the rest of you too.
Focus and be careful.

830
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:30,854
- Be careful.
- Okay.

831
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,726
Good job today.

832
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,615
Put the equipment in each
basket and return them safely.

833
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:50,417
- Okay.
- Okay.

834
00:56:51,124 --> 00:56:53,257
Please check if we missed anything.

835
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,383
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

836
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,884
No, I'm okay.

837
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:02,686
Give me the flask.

838
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,389
Thank you.

839
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,991
- Give me that too.
- Okay.

840
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,000
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?

841
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,124
What is it? Is it hydroxide solution?

842
00:57:21,227 --> 00:57:23,907
Yes, I'm sorry.

843
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,410
Go wash it off quickly and head
to the dispensary right away.

844
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,511
Okay.

845
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:29,813
Watch the glass.

846
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,958
How many more times do I have
to tell you to be careful?

847
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,325
I'm sorry.

848
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:15,845
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

849
00:58:15,957 --> 00:58:18,040
What if it splattered on her face?

850
00:58:18,124 --> 00:58:19,573
Are you sure you dropped it?

851
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:21,106
Is it because of the earlier mistake?

852
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,014
I'm impressed by how you're
always difficult to deal with.

853
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,791
I'm more impressed by you.

854
00:58:24,923 --> 00:58:26,607
I've got surprising news. Ta-da.

855
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:29,440
It's strange. She isn't in
the group picture either.

856
00:58:29,524 --> 00:58:30,807
I wonder why.

857
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,307
- Mi Rae.
- Some people make it obvious,

858
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:36,106
but those who help you without your
knowledge are truly nice people.

859
00:58:36,218 --> 00:58:38,073
How's Dad? He doesn't pick up my calls.

860
00:58:38,157 --> 00:58:40,340
Tae Sik!

861
00:58:40,424 --> 00:58:41,839
I'm at the perfume sampling event.

862
00:58:41,923 --> 00:58:44,888
I searched everywhere. Kyung
Seok nor Kyung Hee is here.

863
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,619
Dad wants to send me off to the States.

864
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:49,825
I might not miss Dad, but I'll miss you.

865
00:58:49,933 --> 00:58:52,325
It is essential you and Kyung
Seok serve at the bar.

866
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:54,222
I heard a strange sound
on my way home again.

867
00:58:54,324 --> 00:58:56,240
It felt like someone was following me.

868
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,973
President Na Hye Sung of Kelun.

869
00:58:58,057 --> 00:58:59,824
- She was also a Chemistry major.
- What?

870
00:58:59,923 --> 00:59:02,707
She's that woman.

871
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:04,407
I have something to tell you.

872
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:06,640
Are you okay? I was worried about you.

873
00:59:06,724 --> 00:59:07,918
It's none of your business.

874
00:59:08,017 --> 00:59:09,410
I also hate those...

875
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:12,145
...who vent their anger on other people.
