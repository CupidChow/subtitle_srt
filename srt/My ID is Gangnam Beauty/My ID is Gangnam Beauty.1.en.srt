1
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,734
Double eyelid surgery and
all-round canthoplasty.

2
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:43,983
A nose job, face contouring surgery,

3
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,467
fat injections, and lip fillers.

4
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,101
75 out of 100.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,016
Double eyelid surgery, epicanthoplasty,

6
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,500
a nose job, and the V-shape
face contouring surgery.

7
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:15,434
70 out of 100.

(All pretty girls know!)

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,667
I'd be happy even with an average face.

11
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,668
75 out of 100. Will I
be able to get there?

12
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:52,383
I'll go through what you
and the doctor discussed.

13
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,867
Double eyelid surgery through
incision and all-round canthoplasty.

14
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,150
Also a nose job with a noble surgery
along with full face contouring...

15
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:00,768
and fat injections all
over the face, right?

16
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,333
83 out of 100.

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,068
Noticeable puffiness and bruises
will last for about a month.

18
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:25,916
Post-procedural complications may
result in bleeding or infections.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,683
Such cases are rare, but
if it is necessary,

20
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,434
she can receive a blood transfusion.

21
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:33,367
Well, that doesn't happen often, does it?

22
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,316
No, not often.

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,450
- It's rare, but it can happen.
- I see.

24
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,884
It usually doesn't happen,
so please don't worry.

25
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,168
- The surgery will go well.
- I see.

It'll be a whole new

00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,467
Yes.

33
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,701
So this is the last time I
can see this face of yours.

34

Mom...

35
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,034
Don't cry.

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,801
- You know that I love you, right?
- Yes.

37
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:37,368
- I love you very much.
- I know.

Go on in.

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,967
You can't cry during the surgery.

41
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,768
You got this, Mi Rae!

42
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:27,101
You'll start feeling sleepy.

43
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,835
- Hey, Fatty!
- Hey, Fatty!

44
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,068
- You pig!
- You pig!

45
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,568
- Mi Rae is a pig!
- Mi Rae is a pig!

46
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:47,402
(What are you looking at?)

47
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,535
(Look at the pig.)

48
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:15,134
What are you looking at? Look at the pig.

49
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:20,016
That was seriously so funny.

50
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
She really looked like a pig earlier.

51
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:32,901
- No, wait!
- Stop it!

52
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,116
- Stop!
- Don't do this!

53
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,034
- Come on!
- It hurts!

54
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,601
I was a brave girl,

55
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,001
and I didn't stay quiet when
the other kids made fun of me.

56
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,817
- But every time I fought back,
- Open the door!

57
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,784
- they'd always do something worse.
- Hurry up and open the door!

58
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,150
- Open it!
- You're strong.

59
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,468
Just break the door open.

60
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:59,068
Open the door!

61
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,534
Open it!

62
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:02,700
I said, open the door!

63
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,434
Winning the fight...

64
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,233
...isn't what victims want.

65
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,333
All they want is to stop being the victim.

66
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,034
They just don't want to be victimized.

67
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:49,135
I'm not going to eat. I
said, I'm not going to eat!

68
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:54,635
But I took out all the bones for you.

69
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,183
You can't leave with an empty stomach.

70
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:02,701
Up until then, I thought I still
had a chance to become pretty.

71
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,450
Because I heard the best kind
of makeover is to lose weight.

72
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,934
You'll only end up gaining weight again!

73
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,767
But I didn't gain my weight back...

74
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,834
...because I was very determined.

75
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,967
Someone in our class got the
highest score in the entire grade.

76
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,500
Mi Rae, congratulations.

77
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,268
No one made fun of me for a while,

78
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,268
so I thought I had finally
become a normal student.

79
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,534
What is it that you need to say?

80
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,302
Here. I made a list of questions
that might come out on the exam.

81
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,068
I'm only giving this to you.

82
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:09,801
Why?

83
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,501
Because...

84
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,216
...I like you.

85
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,567
What?

86
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,201
Are you crazy?

87
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,267
What?

88
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,400
What do you mean?

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,267
Hey, Kang Orc.

90
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:36,935
I'm talking to you, Kang Orc.

91
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,201
Don't you know your nickname?

92
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:41,668
You were joking, right?

93
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:43,769
Tell me you were joking.

94
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,850
- Yong Cheol.
- Hey, Kang Orc.

95
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:48,450
I'm going to kill you if you tell
anybody else that you like me.

96
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,268
You better keep it a secret.

97
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,801
I never...

98
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:05,001
...ended up becoming pretty.

99
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,183
Why don't you just do her a
favor and go out with her?

100
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,383
You go out with her, you jerk.

101
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:24,683
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, Kang Orc.

102
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,650
Yong Cheol told me that
he changed his mind.

103
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,568
What are you saying?

104
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,116
Okay, let's take a photo.

105
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,634
In 1, 2, 3.

106
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,435
- Okay, that was great.
- Nice.

107
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,817
Okay, it's time for Group Three.
Get over here and pose.

108
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:52,049
Hey, hurry up. Okay, nice.

109
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,450
I'm going to take a photo now.
Everybody, pose.

110
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,717
Okay, nice. Let's do this in one go.
In 1, 2, 3.

111
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:00,702
Okay. No, wait.

112
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:04,517
Hey, you over there. You
need to show your face.

113
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,617
- My gosh.
- What's wrong with her?

114
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,316
She's embarrassed to show her
face because she's ugly.

115
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,083
Gosh, it's so hot. This is so annoying.

116
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,049
Okay, let's take one more photo.

117
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,350
Everybody, smile. Let me see your teeth.

118
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,434
Okay, let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

119
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,268
I never got to...

120
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,867
...lead a normal life.

121
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:54,668
I can't even love anyone
like everyone else.

122
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,767
Because...

123
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,934
...I'm an orc.

124
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,434
This place really must be famous.

125
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,534
Look at all these people.

126
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,301
Don't worry about anything else...

127
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,967
...and just focus on resting here
before you start school. Okay?

128
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,468
Mi Rae, you just need to...

129
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,800
...focus on taking in all the good
energy from this mountain...

130
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,868
...and becoming pretty.

131
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:35,867
Let's take in all the good
energy from this mountain...

132
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,400
...so that Mi Rae can become pretty!

133
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:42,850
Just like how the bear hid
in a cave for 100 days...

134
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,701
...and ended up becoming
the beautiful woman,

135
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:48,601
I also started becoming
pretty while staying here.

136
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,634
Here's your new ID.

137
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,201
Thank you.

138
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,467
Are you looking for any specific perfume?

139
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,784
I'd like to get this one, Pomelo.

140
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:51,035
You're feminine and beautiful,
so it'll suit you very well.

141
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,067
I guess you have a date today.

142
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,734
Pardon me?

143
00:14:58,534 --> 00:14:59,868
Well...

144
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,300
I have to attend college
orientation tomorrow.

145
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,035
I've become pretty.

146
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:16,268
The difference is really amazing.

147
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,467
But the thing is...

148
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,066
It's a bit obvious that
I got plastic surgery.

149
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:25,402
I'd say 79 out of 100?

150
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,834
(Taxicab Driver's Permit, Kang Tae Sik)

151
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,602
Hasn't the weather gotten much nicer?

152
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:40,767
Yes.

153
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:44,750
That must be your daughter.

154
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,016
Yes, she's majoring in chemistry
at Hankook University.

155
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,316
She's a freshman.

156
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,016
I see. She must've had good grades.

157
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,884
When I tell people that
she never had a tutor...

158
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:56,235
...or took after-school
classes, no one believes me.

159
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:57,901
I bet you don't believe me either.

160
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,916
Kids who just aren't cut
out for studying...

161
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,750
...must find different paths early on.

162
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:04,468
Many parents make their kids
go through such tough ordeals.

163
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,701
My daughter studied all by herself
and graduated top of her grade.

164
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,168
Top of the school, not just her class!

165
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:15,116
Anyway, she always studies so hard.

166
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,949
Right after the college entrance exam,

167
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,934
she went to the Philippines
to study English.

168
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:27,569
Frankly, I always thought it'd be
nice for her to become a model.

169
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,967
She's tall and slim.

170
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:33,949
She's not that pretty,

171
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,901
but she has such a cute face.

172
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:40,535
What was her name? Doesn't she
look like the actress, Kim Go Eun?

173
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,934
Kim Go Eun?

174
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,417
Some say that my daughter is ugly,

175
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:50,835
but she's prettier than
Kim Tae Hee in my eyes.

176
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,667
You sure love your daughter a lot.

177
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,634
A new face and a new life.

178
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:17,600
I want to be really happy
during my undergraduate years.

179
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:24,434
Hey, university student.

180
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,683
What's up, my fellow university student?

181
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:30,967
Shall we take a photo together to
commemorate this historic moment?

182
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:42,868
Shall we?

183
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,949
I brought my selfie stick
for this very moment.

184
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,983
- Nice.
- Hey, come closer.

185
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,701
1, 2, 3!

186
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,635
Hyun Jung and I have been best friends...

187
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,450
...since middle school, but we didn't
have a single photo together.

188
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,834
Let's take it again.

189
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,668
1, 2, 3.

190
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,602
Isn't it so nice here? Come on.

191
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:05,168
Let's take one here.

192
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:10,467
Because my ugly face looked
even uglier in photos.

193
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,534
1, 2, 3.

194
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,049
1, 2, 3.

195
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,683
What are you doing? Get it right.

196
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,817
Hey, you look so pretty in photos now.

197
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,316
Look, you're so pretty. One more time.

198
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
1, 2, 3.

199
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,617
What are you doing? Come on.

200
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,569
- Okay.
- Look at the camera, okay?

201
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,368
Don't you think people keep looking at me?

202
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,283
I hope it's not because I still look ugly.

203
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,450
Gosh, do you want to hear me
saying it's because you're pretty?

204
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:46,834
Coming from me?

205
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:48,768
Excuse me.

206
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,334
Can I get your number if
that's okay with you?

207
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,701
You're totally my type.

208
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,267
Here.

209
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:03,435
You're totally my type.

210
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,934
You're totally my type.

211
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:10,135
- Hey.
- Yes?

212
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,901
What are you going to do? He's
asking you for your number.

213
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,534
Well...

214
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:20,634
Well... The thing is,

215
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:24,568
I don't have a phone number.

216
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,934
Gosh, she can just say no.

217
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,068
That was so embarrassing.

218
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,268
You idiot.

219
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:36,717
You don't have a phone number?
What kind of nonsense is that?

220
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,201
I know.

221
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,817
That didn't make sense at all.

222
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:44,101
Hey, do you know what he just said to you?

223
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,468
He said you're totally his type.

224
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,083
What type am I?

225
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,901
What do you think? You're the pretty type.

226
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:58,667
Gosh, you needed some time to adjust
yourself to your new, pretty face.

227
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:01,183
Hey, Kang Mi Rae. Pull
yourself together, okay?

228
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,801
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

229
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:06,768
Let's go!

230
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,501
Hey, are you going to give
that guy your number?

231
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,467
Come on.

232

- I don't know.

Hello, my name is Kang Mi Rae.

235
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,268
Thank you.

236
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,068
You are chemistry major.

237

I have to say hi to her.
You're Yoo Eun, right?

- The repeater.
- Yes, for three years.

239
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:55,801
Feel free to talk casually to me.

240

What's your name?

- I'm Kim Sung Woon.
- 80 out of 100.

242
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:03,650
I'd give her 85...

243

- when she's dressed up.
- I'm Lee Ji Hyo.

244
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,234
Gosh, I told you guys
to just talk casually.

245

I'm Choi Jung Boon.

Are you that... Oh, my goodness.

247
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,049
- I didn't even recognize you.
- Whatever.

248
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,300
- I look just like my photo.
- 70 out of 100?

249
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,750
- She has a cute, friendly face.
- I guess you want to argue with me.

250
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:22,884
My goodness.

251
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:26,402
Kim Sung Woon, you're one to talk.
You look nothing like your photo.

252
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,183
- 90 out of 100.
- I was famous for my handsome face.

253
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,517
She's pretty. She'd be popular among guys.

254
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:34,102
- You little...
- What? You jerk.

- Yes.
- Kang Mi Rae?

258
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:54,768
Oh, are you the one with no profile photo?

259
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,316
Well...

260
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,116
- Yes.
- No, that can't be.

261
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,267
She must be X Man.

262

Hey.

263
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:03,750
You are X Man, aren't you?

264
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,916
"X Man"? What is that?

265
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,901
Those in senior year fool freshmen
at the beginning of the semester.

266
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:11,250
You are, right? I bet you are X Man.

267
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,784
No, I'm not. I am a freshman too.

268

Then what's your Chinese zodiac sign?
1, 2, 3.

Gosh, she was born in 1999 indeed.

272
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,150
I guess I look older than my age.

273
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:34,383
No, it's not that. We just think
you're drop-dead gorgeous.

274
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,435
No girl in first year is
this pretty and slim.

00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,817
- Aren't I right?
- Yes, you're right. Totally.

What is this awkward tension?

277
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,784

00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,150
...on your admission
to Hankook University.

321
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,083
You can do this!

322
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,417
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

323
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,483
Hello, my name is Lucky.

324
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,417
Today is a great day for all of you.

325
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,150
I'd like to congratulate everyone.

326
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,483
I'm currently working
under my English name.

327
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,250
And I very much enjoy my life in Korea.

328
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:34,483
This is all because I was
able to learn Korean...

329
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,617
...and Korean culture
at Hankook University.

330
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:40,502
I wish you all happiness
and the best of luck.

331
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:49,049
Hello, I'm Actress Lee Young Ae.

332
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:53,367
I'd like to congratulate all
of you on your admission.

333
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:57,784
A university is a place where
you can search and find...

334
00:25:57,868 --> 00:26:00,517
...what you truly wish to do.

335
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,617
I hope you all enjoy
your university lives,

336
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:06,350
and use your time here to find...

337
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,450
...what you really wish
to do in the future.

338
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,916
Once again, congratulations on your
admission to Hankook University.

339
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,116
And I hope you all enjoy your
life as university students.

340
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,216
Again, congratulations.

341
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,400
(Freshmen Orientation)

342
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:28,316
Now, you'll all be spending time
with the students of your major.

343
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,167
Let's move to the next location.

344
00:26:30,901 --> 00:26:33,802
You're so skinny. I envy you.

345
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,850
You're skinny too.

346
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,784
I need to gain a bit more
weight to look pretty.

347
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,569
I have the body of an
elementary school kid.

348
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,434
Do you not gain weight?

349
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,550
I don't know, but I really enjoy eating.

350
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:45,968
Hey, hey.

351
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,268
He has something to say to you.

352
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,400
I was wondering if you'd like
me to carry that for you.

353
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,168
No, it's okay. Thanks, Won Ho.

354
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,083
You remember my name?

355
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,517
Of course. You're Jang Won Ho.

356
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:01,668
You had a nice voice when
you said hi to me earlier.

357
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,333
Do you not remember my name?

358
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,550
What are you talking about?
Of course, I remember.

359
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,068
You're Soo A. Hyun Soo A.

360
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,316
You have good memory.

361
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,250
Gosh, don't waste your time. I'm
sure she's fussy about guys.

362
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,750
Are you talking about me? That's not true.

363
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,949
Everyone says that.

364
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:24,717
I'm telling the truth. Why
would you think that way?

365
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:26,468
Okay, just bring that over.

366
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:32,617
Gosh, he's so good-looking.

367
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,834
He's extremely handsome.

368
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,534
What?

369
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes, you're right.

370
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:45,168
I'm Ko Ye Na, and I'm a sophomore.

371
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:49,402
I really like watching movies.

372
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:54,049
And I can always treat you
to a meal, so call me.

373
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,467
Next.

374
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:59,535
Hello, I'm Noh Min A, a sophomore.

375
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,801
Hello, I'm Song Jung Ho, a sophomore.

376
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,083
I'm Kim Chan Woo. I entered
this university in 2013.

377
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:12,450
I know I may be hard to approach
since I'm way older than you,

378
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:15,049
but you can always come to me if
you have anything on your mind.

379
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,567
I'll give you advice as your senior.

380
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,884
Lastly, I'm Koo Tae Young,
the student president.

381
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,502
And I'd like to welcome all of you...

382
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,016
...to the chemistry department.

383
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,734
- Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,250
Now, the freshmen can start
introducing themselves.

385
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:34,668
Please come out and say hello.

386
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,617
I'm so nervous to introduce myself.

387
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:38,968
Me too.

388
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,767
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

389
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:52,634
Do Kyung Seok?

390
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,001
I like working out, and I like drinking.

391
00:28:58,234 --> 00:28:59,450
Please call me when you're drinking.

392
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:02,068
- You're good-looking.
- How handsome.

393
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,101
No way.

394
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,767
He can't be the Do Kyung Seok I know.

395
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,467
That's enough.

396
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,335
I'm really nervous.

397
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,450
Hello, I'm Hyun Soo A, a freshman.

398
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,417
My gosh, she's the prettiest
girl I've never seen.

399
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,835
She's going to be the most
popular girl this year.

400
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,683
I know it's important to study
hard as a university student,

401
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,850
but I also want to make a lot of friends.

402
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:37,750
I hope we can all get along well.

403
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,083
I'll become your friend.

404
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,001
I hope we can become really good friends.

405
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:44,302
I have a question. Do
you have a boyfriend?

406
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,884
No, I don't. This is embarrassing,
but I've never dated anyone before.

407
00:29:47,968 --> 00:29:50,116
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No way.

408
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,850
- That's such a lie.
- Unbelievable.

409
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,517
No way. That can't be true.

410
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:57,383
The next girl is really pretty,

411
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:59,134
so I'll just end it here.

412
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,101
Mi Rae, it's your turn.

413
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,901
Me?

414
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:09,949
Okay, let's move onto
the next pretty girl.

415
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,800
"The next pretty girl"?

416
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,801
That makes it sound like
I'm as pretty as her.

417
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:22,168
This is my first time seeing someone
who had plastic surgery done.

418
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,383
I like girls like her.

419
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,734
I see.

420
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:30,001
I'm so nervous.

421
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:33,335
Hello, I'm Kang Mi Rae.

422
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:42,283
I also hope that we'll all get along.

423
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:43,767
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

424
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,283
- No.
- Come on.

425
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,116
Let's be honest.

426
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,467
I really don't have a boyfriend.

427
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,801
Do girls think those kind
of faces are pretty?

428
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,467
I look forward to getting
to know all of you.

429
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:03,901
It's nice to meet you.

430
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,949
Let's move onto the next pretty girl.

431
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,300
Who's next?

432
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:12,683
Come on. Cheers.

433
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,434
- Cheers.
- Cheers. You too.

434
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,517
Soo A, which part do you like?

435
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,617
- Do you like drumsticks?
- Me?

436
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,901
- Let's see.
- Here's one.

437
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:21,884
Here you go, Soo A.

438
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:23,202
No, it's okay.

439
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,350
Can you drink, Soo A?

440
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,668
Yes, I can. Let me pour you a drink first.

441
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:31,035
- Thanks.
- What's she doing?

442
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,850
I'll pour you a drink too.

443
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,802
Gosh, thank you.

444
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,450
You can call me by my name.

445
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:40,049
Give me that. I'll pour you a drink too.

446
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,283
Thank you.

447
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,083
She seems to have a great personality.

448
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,968
- I know. She's really friendly.
- Cheers.

449
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,850
- Let's all clink our glasses.
- Okay.

450
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:48,949
- Welcome.
- Bottoms up.

451
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,483
- Cheers.
- Let's do this.

452
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,617
Let's get along well.

453
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,001
- Welcome.
- Okay.

454
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:55,750
What did you do after taking
the college entrance exam?

455
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:56,817
I had fun.

456
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,168
With your girlfriend?

457
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,701
No.

458
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,867
Why? Don't you have a girlfriend?

459
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:05,435
- No.
- Did you break up with her?

460
00:32:05,534 --> 00:32:07,201
How long has it been since you broke up?

461
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:09,768
I'm not interested.

462
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,116
Do you drink well?

463
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I enjoy drinking. What about you?

464
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,601
It's him.

465
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,001
I think it's him.

466
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,834
Mi Rae, I envy you so much.

467
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,517
- What?
- Your name is as pretty...

468
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,901
as your face.

469
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:54,469
My name is Jung Boon. It's so tacky.

470
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,468
How am I supposed to respond to this?

471
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:58,483
What am I supposed to say?

472
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,683
No, you're prettier. Don't say that.

473
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:03,967
Gosh, come on. That's too big of a lie.

474
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,949
You look like an actress.

475
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,383
Right?

476
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,534
You kind of look like an announcer too.

477
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:14,583
Can you guys drink? We should
start drinking as well.

478
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,001
Okay.

479
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,216
What?

480
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,216
- What?
- What's this?

481
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,884
- Will you look at that?
- My goodness.

483
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,983
If I catch you acting all shy,
I'm going to have to scold you.

484
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,316
You're so manly.

- Yes, let's fill our glasses.

486
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:33,750
Yours is empty.

487
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,802
Jung Boon, I'll pour you a glass.

488
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,467
Mi Rae, you too.

489
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:42,817
- Bottoms up.
- I like that.

490
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,168
Bottoms up.

491
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,100
Mi Rae, do you really
not have a boyfriend?

492
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,268
What? No.

493
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:57,034
Then can I be your boyfriend?

494
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,567
Pardon?

495
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,667
Love, love, love

496
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,016
Chan Woo, you're not as
energetic as you used to be.

497
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,483
Let's all fill our glasses. Come on.

498
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,501

- Pour the drinks.

504
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,034
You can do it!

505
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,968
Even if he's that Kyung Seok... So what?

506
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,767
He won't recognize me anyway.

507
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,400

508

has to be precise.

"Bboong Bboong" by Momoland.

524
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,617
Wrong. "Bboong Bboong"? It's not a fart.
What's the song?

525
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,183
- "Bboom Bboom!

got the correct answer.

correctly earlier.

547

I saw you dancing like this too.
You're a good dancer.

548
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,016
She did?

549
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,483
My goodness, you must've partied a lot.

550
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:07,834
Right?

551
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,368
Kang Mi Rae, you will be our team leader.

No, I can't do things like that.

- Yes.

- Kang Mi Rae, Kang Mi Rae!
- Kang Mi Rae, Kang Mi Rae!

555

to dance as the team's leader.

your best as the team leader.

No...

559
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:33,483
You're a great dancer.

560
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,817
I bet you couldn't resist but
to flaunt your dancing skills.

561
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:38,983
Whatever happened already happened,
and you're a team leader.

562
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,935
Hey, you must give it your all.

563
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,817
If you get all shy and don't do your best,

564
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,617
people will think that
you're trying to act coy.

565

so obnoxious. You know that, right?

Hey, Kang Mi Rae.

568
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,450
Don't be such a coward, okay?

569
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,667
Nothing will change if you
keep avoiding challenges.

570
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,100

to live like you used to.

to flaunt your charms, girl.

No, I practiced alone by watching TV.

You can go alone.

640
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:27,168
Where are you going?

641
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:29,734
To get some fresh air.

642
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:35,601
He's chic.

643
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,801
You were really good at
drinking back there.

644
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:58,901
Sorry, I think I'm drunk.

645
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:04,936
I'm so foolish, don't you think?

646
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:07,834
I get drunk only after a few drinks.

647
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:12,568
Excuse me.

648
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,134
Don't you have anything
to help her sober up?

649
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:20,668
She says she's drunk.

650
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,316
- Soo A.
- Drink this.

651
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,350
- It's best for sobering up.
- Get on my back.

652
00:47:28,434 --> 00:47:30,016
- I'll carry you on my back.
- It's really effective.

653
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,601
- Drink this.
- Hold on.

654
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:20,901
Gosh, it's cold.

655
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,567
What are you doing?

656
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,935
I'm outside.

657
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:27,200
They keep telling me to
drink when I'm in there.

658
00:48:29,934 --> 00:48:31,568
Do you remember Do Kyung Seok?

659
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,868
In our department...

660
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,534
Goodness.

661
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:38,501
Hello?

662
00:48:48,067 --> 00:48:49,334
Hello?

663
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,634
Hello?

664
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,235
I'm sure I called my daughter's number.

665
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:00,302
Who's there?

666
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:02,235
Oh, well...

667
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:07,736
I'm Mi Rae's senior.

668
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:12,350
I see. Why do you have
her phone by the way?

669
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:14,434
Well, that's...

670
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:19,834
Newbies are not allowed to use
their phones during the event.

671
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:22,016
So we collected them for the time being.

672
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,233
Oh, I see.

673
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,049
I'm sorry.

674
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,400
Not at all.

675
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:29,983
I'm sorry.

676
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,534
Well, goodbye then.

677
00:49:36,901 --> 00:49:38,502
Dad...

678
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:49,801
You're home early. Have you eaten dinner?

679
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,767
What's wrong? Did something happen?

680
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:58,201
She was just like Mi Rae.

681
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,668
Did you talk to her on the phone?

682
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:04,650
She looked pretty...

683
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:07,001
...with round eyes and a sharp nose.

684
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:10,268
Well, that's...

685
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:13,502
Ever since she graduated middle school,

686
00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:16,250
she wanted to do a plastic
surgery on her eyelids.

687
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:17,250
What?

688
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:19,983
She got so stressed out
because of her face.

689
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:22,200
There you go again.

690
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:25,201
What's wrong with her face that
you keep stirring up her mind?

691
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,602
I already said no.

692
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:31,001
Did I mishear because I miss my daughter?

693
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:34,001
Her female senior took my call.

694
00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:37,735
Her voice sounded exactly like Mi Rae's.

695
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,201
No way.

696
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:44,083
She should've visited us after
coming back from her studies abroad.

697
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,101
Why did she have to go straight
to the school orientation?

698
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:03,268
Are you okay?

699
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:05,234
What?

700
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,034
Yes.

701
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:12,302
I'm okay.

702
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:14,967
I just feel a little sick.

703
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,700
Drink this.

704
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:23,268
Thank you.

705
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:36,801
Well... Do you want to go
rest if you're too drunk?

706
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,101
You might have to drink again
if you go back inside.

707
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,734
There's a lounge with a sofa over there.

708
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,368
Is there a place like that?

709
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:48,035
Thank you.

710
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:01,135
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

711
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:58,668
I should get some rest too.

712
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:07,802
Why are you standing there? Sit down.

713
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:12,768
Okay.

714
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:30,433
Isn't it uncomfortable?

715
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:33,001
Sit down here comfortably.

716
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:35,301
I'm okay.

717
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,200
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable around me?

718
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,250
Should we change seats then?
I'll sit over there.

719
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:43,202
No, there's no need to.

720
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:45,934
Then I'll sit here.

721
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:14,068
You're very pretty.

722
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:20,402
Are you okay?

723
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,467
I'm okay.

724
00:54:25,834 --> 00:54:27,668
I'm curious,

725
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,468
but you really don't have a boyfriend?

726
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,467
- No.
- Why?

727
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:38,968
I just don't have one.

728
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,567
I see.

729
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,200
Then can I like you?

730
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:51,901
Looking at you playing
games and dancing earlier,

731
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,268
I fell in love.

732
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:02,001
Is this a profession?

733
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:06,433
Don't think too seriously about it though.

734
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:11,935
Oh, right.

735
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:16,935
People might look for me if I
leave my place for too long.

736
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:21,768
Who?

737
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:28,367
No one else is more
interested in you than I am.

738
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,901
They're busy having fun,

739
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,001
so don't bother.

740
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,601
Hey.

741
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,667
Raise me up already.

742
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:08,569
- What are you doing?
- Then, what about you?

743
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,268
It's none of your business.

744
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,767
You went this way, so I wondered
what kind of place it was.

745
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,968
What do you mean? It's no special place.

746
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,968
She seemed too drunk, so I took her
so that she could rest for a while.

747
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:30,735
Why would you open the door all of
a sudden when I was leaning on it?

748
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:34,635
You were stopping the door.

749
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,567
Are you drunk?

750
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:43,133
Look at you being rude to your senior.

751
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,301
I'm letting it go because
you're drunk, all right?

752
00:56:57,434 --> 00:56:58,834
Mi Rae. Let's go.

753
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:23,568
Are you okay?

754
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:28,501
Yes, I'm good.

755
00:57:35,634 --> 00:57:38,268
Rest here if you want to.

756
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:49,467
Kang Mi Rae.

757
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,068
By any chance,

758
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:10,134
did you go to Jadong Middle School?

759
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:22,534
What?

760
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:39,683
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

761
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,750
Kyung Seok treats you
differently from others.

762
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:43,916
Do you go out with him?

763
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,850
- She's already so famous.
- She's really pretty.

764
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:46,850
Mi Rae.

765
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:49,817
You and Mi Rae might get along
with each other very well...

766
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,517
though I feel a little bad.

767
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:53,402
I haven't done any plastic surgery.

768
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:55,335
Mi Rae hasn't either.

769
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:56,483
You think it's funny?

770
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:57,983
Do you go to this university?

771
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,935
I'm your daughter, Mi Rae.

772
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:01,800
Gosh, you plastic monster.

773
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,016
What have I done?

774
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,634
Are you on one-sided love?
