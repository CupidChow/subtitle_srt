1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:02,198
Good job today.

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:05,004
Put the equipment in each
basket and return them safely.

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:06,602
- Okay.
- Okay.

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,369
Please check if we missed anything.

5
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:15,682
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,317
No, I'm okay.

7
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,302
Give me the flask.

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,022
Thank you.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,224
- Give me that too.
- Okay.

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,302
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

11
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,535
What is it? Is it hydroxide solution?

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,340
Yes, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,843
Go wash it off quickly and head
to the dispensary right away.

14
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,344
Okay.

15
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:46,135
- Watch the glass.
- Hey!

16
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,768
How many more times do I have
to tell you to be careful?

17
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,134
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,007
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:21,804
It's okay. Little shards
must've gotten on me.

20
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:24,501
What would you have done had
they gotten stuck in your face?

21
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,923
- Soo A.
- Hey!

22
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:32,834
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,531
Thanks, Won Ho.

24
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,702
A box of adhesive bandage without
ointment? What was he thinking?

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,801
- Take it off carefully.
- I'll go pick up some ointment.

26
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,501
It's okay. The cut isn't deep.

27
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,022
You must love vending machines.

28
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,133
I heard you cleaned up
all the broken glass.

29
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,319
- I'm sorry.
- I didn't do it for you.

30
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,301
You're always so prickly toward me.

31
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:36,867
I find it quite impressive.

32
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,535
Impressive? I can't
beat you on that front.

33
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:48,202
It must be fun.

34
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,216
What?

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,834
Having fun with the guy you
like that likes you back.

36
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,934
That's not what's going on.

37
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:57,501
- Soo A.
- Hey, Soo A.

38
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,426
I heard you got hurt. Do
you want me to carry you?

39
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:01,514
It's not a big deal.

40
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,617
What do you mean it's not a big deal?
It's a big deal to me.

41
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,686
Hey, get down.

42
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,886
No, it's okay.

43
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,287
If you can't trust him, you
can get on my back instead.

44
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,302
- My back is broader.
- No, mine's broader.

45
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,701
- Soo A!
- Soo A!

46
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,392
Hey, it's fine.

47
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,994
She's fine. She's okay.

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,095
I'm okay.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,198
- She's okay! Soo A's okay!
- Nice!

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,533
Let's go eat.

51
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,860
How's your hand? Is it okay?

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,973
Yes.

53
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,068
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

54
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,796
Did you really break it?

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,183
Of course, I broke it.

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,783
Are they hiring an announcer or something?

57
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,949
Why can't a waitress have a dialect?

58
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:53,033
How can you fall in love at first sight?

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,491
What do you like about him?

60
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,105
He has a beautiful smile.

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,062
I didn't know that kind of smile
was considered beautiful.

62
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,768
The moment he smiled,

63
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:06,068
I felt a rush of dopamine
spreading through my body.

64
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,869
Dopamine?

65
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,187
Eat up.

66
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,483
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

67
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,091
No, I'm okay.

68
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:19,826
Give me the flask.

69
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,629
Thank you.

70
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,234
Why aren't you eating?

71
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:36,267
Is it because of the
mistake you made earlier?

72
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,068
No.

73
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,134
Is it because the TA scolded you?

74
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:43,330
He didn't scold her. He was
just telling her to be careful.

75
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,095
By the way,

76
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:54,668
Chan Woo didn't do anything to
you after that incident, did he?

77
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
No.

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,300
I wasn't going to tell you this
because it was a private discussion.

79
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,501
But Woo Young actually called
me to his office that day.

80
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:05,743
Chan Woo gathered all the
freshmen from our year.

81
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,836
He had already heard about what happened.

82
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,743
So I just told him everything.

83
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,767
Well, I told you that wench,
Kang Mi Rae, hit me first.

84
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,552
Do you believe the freshmen's
words over my words?

85
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,953
Hey, Chan Woo.

86
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,257
Regardless of the reason,

87
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:27,861
if you bother freshmen once again,

88
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,931
I'm going to do my best
to ruin your future.

89
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:33,531
I'm going to talk to
every single freshman...

90
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,835
...and expose every bad deed you've done.

91
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:39,134
I'll make sure you get no reference
letter when you graduate.

92
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:41,015
Even if you manage to get a job
without a reference letter,

93
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,811
I'll tell our alumni in the field
about everything you've done.

94
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,202
Just a moment.

95
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,434
Didn't you say you'll pay for this?

96
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,422
- Hello.
- I'll pay for everything.

97
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,026
Thank you.

98
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,734
- Thank you.
- Sure thing, I'll see you around.

99
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,135
That's what you call a senior.

100
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:11,548
I was getting sick of being
the head of our year...

101
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,634
...and coming to school
because of Chan Woo.

102
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:17,811
But Woo Young made me feel
a lot more comfortable.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,151
I guess I should've told you this.

104
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:35,115
Our one on one customer
strategy started going viral,

105
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,418
and a lot of celebrities promoted
our products via social media,

106
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,459
so we're getting positive results
faster than we expected.

107
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,805
Since our sales have become stable,
we're planning to strengthen...

108
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,308
...our marketing strategy by
hiring a model for our brand.

109
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,750
And we're going to increase
our brand awareness...

110
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,450
...to expand our product
line and sales volume.

111
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,916
That way, we'll be able to maintain
our current product costs,

112
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,817
and increase our sales at the same time.

113
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,020
That sounds great.

114
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,417
Perfumes rely more on each person's
individual satisfaction...

115
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,517
...rather than other people's opinions.

116
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,801
So I want to maintain the unique
characteristic of our products.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,717
Please continue developing
our brand without losing...

118
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,801
...our brand's characteristic.

119
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,735
And consider making
affiliate brands as well.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,739
Okay.

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,643
Next, there will be a briefing
about the perfume sampling event.

122
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,294
- Let's go.
- Hello.

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,999
I can't believe you're a professor.

124
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,467
My gosh.

125
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,784
It feels like yesterday
that you got scolded...

126
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,035
for pretending to be MacGyver in the lab.

127
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,250
Yes, I remember. You're
the one who started it.

128
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,542
Really?

129
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,949
Let me see. You haven't changed at all.

130
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,850
You've become more cheerful.

131
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,583
I've aged a lot.

132
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,350
You look nice.

133
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,652
Hello, professor.

134
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,756
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

135
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,858
Remember the thesis I sent you last time?

136
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:46,469
He's the one who wrote it.

137
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,062
Really?

138
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,865
Hello.

139
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,366
I was getting sick of being
the head of our year...

140
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:05,578
...and coming to school
because of Chan Woo.

141
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:09,482
But Woo Young made me feel
a lot more comfortable.

142
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,534
Hey, Mom.

143
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,150
You're eating lunch now?

144
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,784
I had a busy schedule.

145
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,483
Having a lot of work
to do is a good thing.

146
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,717
I'll do part-time jobs and
pitch in for the hospital fee,

147
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,402
so don't work too hard.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,907
Hearing you say that is more than enough.

149
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:34,007
Just focus on studying and having fun.

150
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:35,747
What about Dad?

151
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,610
What about him?

152
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,041
He won't pick up my calls.

153
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,216
- A set menu, please.
- Okay.

154
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:48,858
- Mom?
- Right.

155
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,983
Don't worry.

156
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:55,962
He'll call you soon,
so give him some time.

157
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,065
Okay.

158
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:05,177
Hey, what are you doing here?

159
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,227
You're here.

160
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,692
- Hey.
- Yes?

161
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,377
Take a photo of me.

162
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,683
(Voice message)

163

Mi Rae told me that she'll
pay back the hospital fee.

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,801
Hearing her say that almost made me cry.

165
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,001
Is this how you show your
daughter that you love her?

166
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,111
I get that you're upset.

167
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,034
But what can you do? What's done is done.

168
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,117
I have a limit to how much
I can put up with this.

169
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,720
You're not even sending me
money for living expenses.

170

Honey!

174
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,934
You should at least eat!

Why did you upload the photo?

183
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,692
You hate taking pictures with me.

184
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,276
Only because it's a sure way
to gain more followers.

185

I know it's lame, but what can I do?

You don't smoke, right?

187
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,902
I should quit.

188
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:01,281
Do you actually smoke?

189
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:05,102
Did you buy that? You're so gullible.

190
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,987
Dad said he'll send me to the States.

191

I obviously won't get into one of
the best colleges like you did.

192

I guess he'll send me to
some no-name school there.

193
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:16,767
- Did you tell him that you'd go?
- I can't disobey him, you know.

194
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,732
Don't go if you don't want to.

195
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,936
Well, I don't really dislike the idea.

My allowance will probably
go up if I move there.

According to his teachings,

220
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,817
we must sacrifice ourselves
in and outside...

221

...of the church like a grain of wheat
that gladly sacrifices itself.

We must also live the kind of life
where we can nourish our children.

I'm sure some of you
already know his story.

He's a single dad, and the
government keeps him busy,

231

I majored in chemistry
for the same reason.

323
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:06,734
Since when did you want
to become a perfumer?

324
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:14,153
Ever since I read a
magazine in middle school.

325
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:19,367
I'd like to thank everyone
for attending today's event.

326
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,329
I'm Lee Soo Hyun, the
director of Kelun Korea.

327
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:26,316
Your payment is complete. I'll
call you once your drink is ready.

328
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,533
Okay.

329
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,617
One Americano, please.

330
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,039
- One Americano?
- Soo A, you can sit down.

331
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:36,067
Oh, thank you.

332
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,316
One Americano?

333
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,034
- Yes.
- Okay.

334
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:43,615
When do you finish?

335
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,617
I still have an hour left.

336
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,019
I have great news.

337
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:49,734
(Jaryong Middle School)

338
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,534
Hey.

339
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:54,834
It's time for President
Na Hye Sung's speech.

340
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:02,435
Hello, I'm Na Hye Sung.

341
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:11,868
I thought about what I should say to you.

342
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,817
And thanks to a young lady I met just now,

343
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:19,001
I was reminded of what I wrote
in a magazine a long time ago.

344
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:23,501
"The true beauty of perfume
lies in the fact..."

345
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:26,001
"...that it can't be seen."

346
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:30,450
"Scent is the one and
only beautiful thing..."

347
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:32,834
"...that can be felt even
with your eyes closed."

348
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,784
"I believe this intangible beauty..."

349
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,968
"...will be somewhat of a consolation..."

350
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:41,868
"...to those who are sick of this world
that only focuses on outer beauty."

351
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:47,494
I think we are blessed
to be able to love...

352
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:49,901
this intangible beauty called scent.

353
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:52,949
I hope you all enjoy your time.

354
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:56,834
And thank you so much for
coming to our event.

355
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,150
You did great.

356
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,049
- That was amazing. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

357
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,183
- Hello.
- Welcome.

358
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:12,168
I really liked your speech.

359
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,016
Ta-da. Isn't this amazing?

360
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,400
Junoflo told me that he'll listen
to my mix tape if I send him one.

361
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:21,668
What's wrong?

362
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,800
That's her.

363
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,450
(Kang Mi Rae)

364
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:34,368
Isn't it weird? She's not
even in the group photo.

365
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,334
I wonder if it's her.

366
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,834
Maybe she was absent on the day
they took graduation photos.

367
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,850
Don't people normally
hand in another photo?

368
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,468
No one leaves it blank.

369
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:50,601
I think she used to hate taking photos.

370
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,926
I wonder why.

371
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:55,396
Maybe she used to look like a monster.

372
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,235
Gosh, come on.

373
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:05,528
Why don't you just tell her that
you're the one who wrote it?

374
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,583
Thank you for coming.

375
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,034
Thank you.

376
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:14,202
I wrote that I was sick of the world
that only focused on outer beauty...

377
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,101
...and that's why I came to like perfumes.

378
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,801
What would she say once she finds out
that I got plastic surgery done?

379
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Mi Rae.

380
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:27,483
What's your plan for today?

381
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,168
If you're free, I was thinking
about buying you guys dinner.

382
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,668
I'm sorry. I'm a little busy today.

383
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:36,702
No, it's okay. Don't be sorry.

384
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:38,968
I'll see you at school then.

385
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,801
See you next time.

386
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:44,168
Hey, Woo Young.

387
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,302
I'm sorry for last time.

388
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:49,035
What are you talking about?

389
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,100
You tried to help me that
night at the party, but I...

390
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,967
Are you talking about when
you spilled water on me?

391
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,467
That's fine. Don't worry about it.

392
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,601
I'll see you guys.

393
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,034
Thank you for inviting me.

394
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,016
- I'll see you again at school.
- See you next time.

395
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,001
I'm going to go home.

396
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,490
I need to write the
lyrics when I'm inspired.

397
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:17,135
Okay. You should write
about how I feel as well.

398
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,134
Bye.

399
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,467
I'll see you at work.

400
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,949
I was able to make a good speech
thanks to you. Thank you.

401
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:41,483
No, you're the one who wrote it.

402
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:44,289
That's why I'm grateful. That
was the first and last time...

403
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,001
I ever wrote anything in a magazine,
but you remembered that until now.

404
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:50,068
Gosh, I'm so touched.

405
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:55,491
Would you like to eat dinner with me...

406
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,424
...if you're free?

407
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:58,710
Pardon?

408
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:01,373
Do you feel uncomfortable that
I'm asking you to eat with me...

409
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,208
...when we just met today?

410
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,177
No, not at all.

411
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,316
I'd love to.

412
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,116
- Really?
- Yes.

413
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,484
Does the food street in front
of our school still exist?

414
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:17,235
Our school's surrounded by food streets.

415
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:25,035
I used to walk here like this.

416
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,331
Why?

417
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,835
Why do you think? Because I was drunk.

418
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,939
Do you drink, Mi Rae?

419
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,683
Just a little.

420
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:39,778
Then let's skip dinner
and go drink right away.

421
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,869
You can choose where we should go.

422
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,585
I don't know that many bars.

423
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,867
I don't mind going anywhere.

424
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,814
I'm busy, and I'm also really lonely.

425
00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:00,099
I don't have a girlfriend.
Show me some pity.

426
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,805
You should be able to handle this
alone to cut down on labor costs.

427
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:06,312
That's not for you to say.
You get paid a lot.

428
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,168
Just get over here.

429
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,727
Welcome. Is it just you two?

430
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:13,138
Yes.

431
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,582
Hey.

432
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,617
- Hello.
- Hi.

433
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:17,949
Please sit down.

434
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,567
- This way.
- Okay.

435
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,278
Where are you going at this hour?

436
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,734
Yoo Jin asked me for help.

437
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:40,568
I really don't understand that punk.

438
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:43,401
I'll see you when I get back.

439
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,300
Always be careful of your actions.

440
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:54,834
Today's event was really incredible.

441
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,068
I've never been to an event
like that in my life.

442
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:06,368
I can't drink that well yet.

443
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,567
I also want to drink well.

444
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,316
I re-read what I had written,

445
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,567
and I realized that it
was just full of bluff.

446
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:25,793
I was talking about the trend...

447
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:28,178
...and some other stuff that
I didn't really mean.

448
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:33,468
But I came to my senses as
soon as I talked to you.

449
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:36,269
I realized that I'm just
someone who likes perfumes...

450
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,955
...more than I am a businesswoman.

451
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,867
Here you go.

452
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,474
One more bottle, please.

453
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,865
I always drink my shots in one go.

454
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,377
This is why they say it's
hard to change old habits.

455
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:55,770
I think it's great.

456
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,433
I've aged and deteriorated in many ways,

457
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,514
but I'm still good at drinking.

458
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,623
I envy you so much.

459
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,309
Why?

460
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:11,135
Because you're living your dream.

461
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,707
Being envious...

462
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:27,166
...is also a sad thing.

463
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:33,193
Being envious of something...

464
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:35,512
...that's ordinary...

465
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,990
...is sad.

466
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:47,623
Hey, you over there.

467
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,900
- I said your face must show.
- Gosh, seriously.

468
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,137
What is her problem?

469
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:54,840
Her ugly face is her problem.
No wonder she wants to hide it.

470
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:56,541
It's too hot. I'm getting annoyed.

471
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,843
Hey, Kang Orc.

472
00:32:57,968 --> 00:33:00,283
I'll kill you if you tell people
that you have a crush on me.

473
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,168
You'd better not tell anyone.

474
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,101
Being envious of something...

475
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,291
...that's ordinary...

476
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,001
...is sad.

477
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:51,268
Mi Rae.

478
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,567
Yes.

479
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,282
Mom, I said it's okay.

480
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:06,134
Come on, it's fine. Give it to me.

481
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:09,974
Gosh, it's so heavy. Let's go, son.

482
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,200

- What are you...

...doing here?

489
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,767

490
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:31,942
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can help out today.

It's okay. Please get home safely.

Let go.

510
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,670
I told you to let go of me. Gosh...

511
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,674
Let go. Please let go of me!

such a thing to others?

602
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:25,364
9 dollars and 90 cents seem a bit
cheap, so I'll make it 10 dollars.

Then how many of it
should you sell a month?

604
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:34,364
If I work part-time for 4 hours,
it's 30 dollars and 12 cents.

605
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,564
I think I should sell at least 60.

606
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,270
Do you think you'll be able to?

607
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:42,006
I'll raise the price for the
ones with a bigger size.

608
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:45,863
If it's not enough, I should
get another part-time job.

609
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,964
It's 71 dollars and 60 cents.

610
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:02,330
Can't you give us a little discount?

611
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:05,434
Go ahead and check the other stores.
Our place is the cheapest.

really often from now on.

What are you doing?

619
00:51:37,196 --> 00:51:40,797
Please give us a 10-cent
discount for each item. Please?

620
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:50,733
Come on.

621
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:57,568

640
00:53:15,363 --> 00:53:17,563
I guess good looks are
genetically inherited.

641
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:22,163
Are his parents divorced then?

642
00:53:23,972 --> 00:53:27,473

00:53:41,063 --> 00:53:43,997
She saved your life, so what's
there you can't do for her?

647
00:53:45,281 --> 00:53:46,948
Don't say that.

648
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:51,096
It's hard for me to say no to her as well.

649
00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:54,389
So don't say such a thing.

650
00:53:54,975 --> 00:53:58,258
That's right. You're good.

651
00:53:58,396 --> 00:54:00,429
Nice job.

652
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,613
Look.

653
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:06,196
Fill 20 percent of the glass with foam.

654
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:07,999
Nice and neat like that.

655
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:09,730
Do you want to try another glass?

656
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,973
Glaring like that will
only hurt your eyes.

657
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:25,496
Go ask them what they need.

658
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:30,579
Can you give us a glass of water?

659
00:54:30,663 --> 00:54:32,469
You already have it.

660
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,304
I mean, warm water.

661
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,696
Do you drink warm water with beer?

662
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,596
That's up to me.

663
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:44,031
Did you just see her throw
a fit at her customer?

664
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,337
Let's stop drinking and go.

665
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:52,896
- Kyung Seok.
- Kyung Seok.

666
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:55,008
- Did you come alone?
- Yes.

667
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,597
Sit here then.

668
00:54:57,036 --> 00:54:58,470
Hi, Kyung Seok.

669
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,396
Let's sit over there.

670
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:05,430
Give us two glasses of beer.

671
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,739
Is he trying to avoid me now?

672
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:11,642
You're making me want to avoid you too.

673
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,347
Thank you.

674
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:35,265
The mid-terms are over, but I don't
know why my business is so slow.

675
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,268
It went all right in the beginning
of the semester, but not anymore.

676
00:55:39,862 --> 00:55:41,995
Maybe my father's prayer is working.

677
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:44,575
Does he pray for your business to fail?

678
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,976
Don't get me started.

679
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:49,396
He keeps talking about "The Return
of the Prodigal Son" these days.

680
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,583
He must be waiting for
you with a feast then.

681
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,307
I should be the one who
prepares the feast...

682
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:57,026
...by becoming successful somehow.

683
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,090
My mother helped me because
she counted on me.

684
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,095
Oh, please.

685
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,297
Come on...

686
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,603
It's not my phone.

687
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:18,212
Check your phone already if
you know you got a message.

688
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:20,097
It could be from Kyung Hee.

689
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,049
(Kang Mi Rae)

690
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:29,453
Can we meet up tomorrow?

691
00:56:37,366 --> 00:56:39,167
Hasn't she contacted you yet?

692
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,380
Let's not talk about it.

693
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:09,683
(Hankook Campus Fest)

694
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:11,477
I hope Twice comes.

695
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:14,798
Twice.

696
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,406
Soo A.

697
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,207
Hello.

698
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,110
It is essential you and Kyung
Seok serve at the bar.

699
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:28,512
What?

700
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,479
- We'll serve too.
- Well, right.

701
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,716
We might not need your help.

702
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:39,423
Why is it essential for me?

703
00:57:41,496 --> 00:57:43,097
Because you're the face of our campus.

704
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,236
Exactly. I want to help her.

705
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:48,922
Why would they want to
stop me from helping?

706
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:53,236
Stop hitting on Soo A already.

707
00:57:53,363 --> 00:57:55,930
If you want to copy Kyung
Seok, do it properly.

708
00:57:56,229 --> 00:57:57,663
Be chic.

709
00:57:58,363 --> 00:58:00,164
Goodness.

710
00:58:14,396 --> 00:58:15,930
Did you do good on your mid-terms?

711
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:18,231
Yes.

712
00:58:26,229 --> 00:58:28,063
How about we have a drink?

713
00:58:54,735 --> 00:58:57,716
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

714
00:58:57,808 --> 00:59:00,424
I smiled only once throughout
my middle school life.

715
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:01,901
It was because of you.

716
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,613
- I must be crazy.
- There's a beauty among freshmen?

717
00:59:04,697 --> 00:59:05,909
What about Kang Mi Rae?

718
00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:07,110
She's a new face.

719
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:09,613
Can you help us serve at the
bar during the campus fest?

720
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:11,915
What about Mi Rae? She must be in it.

721
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,917
She's the known as the goddess
of Hankook University.

722
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,420
Why did she like your picture?

723
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,122
I thought you guys didn't
know each other at first...

724
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,646
because you acted as
if you were strangers.

725
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:21,845
What do you do during the festival?

726
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:23,845
During the festival? I'm not sure.

727
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,646
I'm a bit busy these days.

728
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,546
Right? You're the teaching
assistant of Mi Rae's department.

729
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,132
How about we grab some beer later today?

730
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,134
It'd be nice if we go nearby our
school and tell Mi Rae to join us.

731
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:33,842
We have a good selection of servers.

732
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:36,740
Soo A is feminine while Mi Rae is sexy.

733
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:38,759
That woman came back to Korea.

734
00:59:38,844 --> 00:59:41,858
She had an affair with a young
punk and abandoned her children.

735
00:59:41,943 --> 00:59:43,657
I know you won't see her
even if she asks you to.

736
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:44,713
Mi Rae.

737
00:59:44,797 --> 00:59:46,479
I'll hold a housewarming party after
unpacking, so come over then.

738
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:48,285
What are you doing? Didn't
you say you were busy?

739
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:50,987
- When will you hold the party?
- Are you really going to come?

740
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,390
Or is there someone you like among them?
