1
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:17,518
Are you surprised?

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,553
What?

3
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,057
Yes, a little.

4
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,359
- I'm sorry.
- No.

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,225
It's not that.

6
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,542
Shall we...

7
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:44,344
...go to bed now?

8
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:48,348
What?

9
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:49,950
What?

10
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,258
Gosh, that's not what I meant.

11
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,059
I meant that we should get some sleep now.

12
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:07,334
I didn't say anything.

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,468
I'll sleep here...

14
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,878
...and take the first bus in the
morning, so you should go in.

15
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:20,147
No, I'll go with you.

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,317
It'll be uncomfortable to sleep here.

17
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,754
No, it's not uncomfortable. It's fine.

18
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,347
At least get changed...

19
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,061
My dad's clothes will
be too small for you.

20
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,548
I'm fine, so just go
in and get some sleep.

21
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,181
You won't even get that much sleep.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,170
All right, then.

23
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:47,774
You'll probably get no
sleep if I don't sleep.

24
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,781
Sweet dreams.

25
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,680
All right, you too.

26
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:18,625
This feels surreal for some reason.

27
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,191
It's not a dream, but I
feel as if I'm dreaming.

28
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:33,620
I had my first kiss.

29
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,361
Oh, right.

30
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:33,213
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:36,717
It's okay.

32
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:41,014
Good night.

33
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:43,356
You too.

34
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,108
She left her phone here.

35
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,714
(Mom)

36
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,681
(Mom)

37
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,135
Is everything really okay? I'm worried.

38
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:12,873
(Everything is fine.)

39
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,541
(Mom)

40
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:26,614
(Mom)

41
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:28,488
Hello?

42
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,615
Mi Rae. Hello?

43
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,629
Yes, hello.

44
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:38,548
My gosh, who are you?

45
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,902
- Please don't be surprised.
- Who are you?

46
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

47
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,397
(Call Ended)

48
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:51,681
(Mom, Video Call)

49
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:58,919
Hello.

50
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:01,815
Why are you answering Mi Rae's phone?

51
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:05,225
She's asleep now.

52
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,127
What? Where?

53
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,095
In her room.

54
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,097
I'm in the living room now.

55
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:22,514
Well... Why are you guys there?

56
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,511
We were hanging out in the area...

57
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,446
...and missed the last bus to Seoul.

58
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,847
Is it just the two of you?

59
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,550
Yes.

60
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,553
What's your relationship with her?

61
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,157
I'm her boyfriend.

62
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,559
- You?
- Yes.

63
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,963
You and Mi Rae are seeing each other?

64
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,164
Yes.

65
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,665
So you're saying you two are
in a relationship, right?

66
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:48,868
Yes.

67
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,072
I'm sorry to surprise you like this.

68
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,077
What are you doing out here?

69
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,179
Then good night.

70
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:00,848
(Video Call Ended)

71
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,053
Who was that?

72
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,356
Mi Rae's boyfriend.

73
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,957
What?

74
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,859
Do you know who it is?

75
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,763
That super handsome guy!

76
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,157
(Mom Video Call)

77
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,795
So it's true.

78
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,297
Hello.

79
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:54,667
- You're Mi Rae's boyfriend?
- Yes.

80
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,270
I'm just going to say one thing.

81
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,739
There are CCTV cameras at our place.

82
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,343
Everything is being recorded.

83
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,613
Then bye for now.

84
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,766
What time is it now?

85
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,207
Oh, no.

86
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,210
I have to wash my face quickly
and put makeup on again.

87
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:19,452
I didn't wash my face last night. It
must've wreaked havoc on my skin.

88
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,757
It's still much better than
showing him my bare face.

89
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:48,281
Why is he sleeping sitting like that?
It must be uncomfortable.

90
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,797
Where are the CCTV cameras?

91
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,992
You woke up.

92
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,793
Where are the CCTV cameras?

93
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,295
CCTV cameras?

94
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,799
What are you talking about? Why
would we have that at home?

95
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,246
What's wrong?

96
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,368
Did you have a nightmare?

97
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,246
I'll sleep for 10 more minutes.

98
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,087
Gosh, slow down. They already left.

99
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:43,688
Why did Dad tell such a lie? Kyung
Seok couldn't sleep a wink.

100
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:46,606
Does he feel guilty about something?
Why couldn't he sleep?

101
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,610
What's there to feel guilty about?

102
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,887
I guess you can't really talk now
because he's right beside you.

103
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:56,115
Yes.

104
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,484
Then let's talk later. Bye.

105
00:11:58,586 --> 00:11:59,786
Bye.

106
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,486
Do your parents not like me?

107
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,965
You weren't sleeping?

108
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:15,068
That wasn't an ideal way to
meet them for the first time.

109
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,354
Judging from how your dad told
me that there are CCTV cameras,

110
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,288
he probably doesn't like me.

111
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,475
Should I not have answered the call?

112
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,777
Why? Are you worried?

113
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,253
Of course I am.

114
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,387
I've never seen you worried about
how strangers might think of you.

115
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,953
How can I not be worried?

116
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:36,556
They're not strangers.

117
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,258
I mean, they're your parents.

118
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,510
They're just fascinated that
I now have a boyfriend.

119
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,233
- That's all?
- Yes.

120
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,121
So stop worrying and just get some sleep.

121
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,944
You didn't get much sleep either.

122
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,345
Aren't you tired?

123
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,415
A little.

124
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,821
- Rest your head on my shoulder.
- What?

125
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:10,890
Rest your head here and get some sleep.

126
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:25,850
You should rest your head on me too.

127
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,352
What?

128
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,004
It was obviously taken
without her consent.

129
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:47,727
Why can't you delete it?

130
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,829
Are you the person in the photo?

131
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,730
Gosh, that's...

132
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,406
Can't it be shut down if it's a
domestically hosted website?

133
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,443
We've also categorized
it as a harmful website,

134
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,456
but it won't be easy to shut it down.

135
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,087
We could block the domain to prevent
people from accessing the site.

136
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:09,686
Then...

137
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:11,671
...what about photos that
have already leaked?

138
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:14,087
And what if those photos
are posted elsewhere?

139
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,489
We are trying to track them
down to get rid of them.

140
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,791
Anyway, you can file a report
on behalf of the victim,

141
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,286
but the victim will still
have to give a statement.

142
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,236
Hello?

143
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:27,686
Hello.

144
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,595
Hi, it's been a while.

145
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:38,638
Who told you that this is me?

146
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,169
Jang Won Ho? Or Jo Jung Yeob?

147
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:42,553
Jung Yeob knows about this too?

148
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,553
Gosh, Jang Won Ho.

149
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,947
I can't believe he's spreading
such groundless rumours.

150
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:51,185
No, he's not. Won Ho came to see
me because he's worried about you.

151
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,186
And he promised that he won't tell anyone.

152
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,987
How can I believe that?

153
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,857
Soo A.

154
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:00,693
I don't want to make you
anxious for no reason,

155
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,296
but wouldn't it bother you if you
didn't do anything about it?

156
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:06,666
Wouldn't it be better to find out
who did it and get him punished?

157
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,669
The police can only launch
an investigation...

158
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,270
...once they recognize it as a crime.

159
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,487
But I looked into it,

160
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,774
and it'll be hard in this case.

161
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,610
The victim has to come forward
and give a statement.

162
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,112
The victim?

163
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,214
What?

164
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,356
I don't want to do that. I don't
want people to think I'm weird.

165
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,586
Why would people think that?

166
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,387
The person who took and
posted these is weird.

167
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,790
It may be that person's fault,

168
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:33,292
but weird rumours will spread about me.

169
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,194
The victims often end
up being criticized...

170
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,096
...when you report cases like this.
Haven't you seen it?

171
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:38,698
The photos will spread even more.

172
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,501
So the police must investigate it
as soon as possible to stop it.

173
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,603
The police can track down
and delete the photos.

174
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,287
Every download is recorded,
so they can track them down.

175
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,386
And...

176
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,920
...let's ask the police to make sure
rumours don't spread in the process.

177
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:54,614
As soon as they find out who did
it, they'll summon the suspect,

178
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,048
so don't worry too much.

179
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,751
I don't want to do it.

180
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:03,953
I don't want to do anything.

181
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:06,319
Just leave me alone, please.

182
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,953
Bye, then.

183
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,352
Soo A, wait.

184
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,820
She was still asleep when I got home.

185
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,034
She just thinks that I got home late.

186
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,022
Shall we have dinner together
after getting some rest?

187
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:35,816
Sure, let's do that.

188
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,023
See you later, then.

189
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,324
Okay, bye.

190
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:47,353
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

191
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:51,322
- You can hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.

192
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,339
No.

193
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:54,844
Fine, then I'll hang up first.

194
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,989
- See you later.
- Okay.

195
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:04,584
I didn't know hanging up was this hard.

196
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,291
Hey, Eun.

197
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,006
What's up?

198
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,009
Apparently, Eun needs to
talk to me about Soo A.

199
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,745
Can we meet tomorrow?

200
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,022
What more is there to talk about her?

201
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,818
Soo A isn't in a very
good condition right now.

202
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,622
I'll just hear what's going on.

203
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:48,628
- Don't go.
- Don't worry.

204
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,063
I'll call after I'm done.

205
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,077
I guess she ended up hating you...

206
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:46,093
because of what she's been through.

207
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:50,920
I know.

208
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,347
I'm pretty sure she was
really mean to you.

209
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,461
I can already imagine.

210
00:19:57,577 --> 00:20:01,044
It was hard to accept it at first
because I actually liked her.

211
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:08,336
Every time I was with her,
I got really nervous...

212
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,444
...because of how she pretty she is.

213
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:14,747
And when she referred to me as her friend,

214
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,053
I got really excited.

215
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,853
It's a bit embarrassing,

216
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,253
but having someone so
pretty as a friend...

217
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,160
...made me feel like I was
that pretty as well.

218
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:36,934
Anyway, there's nothing I can
do to help Soo A right now.

219
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:38,680
Plus, I don't really want to.

220
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:44,222
It's only natural that you feel that way.

221
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,354
But I feel like...

222
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,241
...Soo A's life will change completely...

223
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,753
...if you guys end up being
friends in the future.

224
00:20:57,453 --> 00:21:01,421
I couldn't even be in control
of my own life until now.

225
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,654
So how do you think I'll be able
to change someone else's life?

226
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,833
The scars you get from other people...

227
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,519
...can only be healed by people.

228
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,639
I don't quite get it either.

229
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,354
But one thing for sure.

230
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,354
The one person that can heal Soo A...

231
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,920
...is neither Kyung Seok nor anybody else.

232
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,452
It's you.

233
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,959
Soo A isn't in a very
good condition right now.

234
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:36,962
I'll just hear what's going on.

235
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,633
Can she be less nice?

236
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:03,038
Is there something going on?

237
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,245
No, it's fine.

238
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:13,554
Hey, Kyung Seok.

239
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:17,119
Do you know anyone who
stalks Soo A at school?

240
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,539
Won Ho?

241
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,020
Never mind. It's nothing.

242
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,386
- Hello?
- Where are you?

243
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,226
I'm in Eun's neighbourhood. What's up?

244
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:44,753
You don't need to come pick me up.

245
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:51,070
Okay.

246
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,686
I won't forgive her.

247
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,916
I'm not going to let her
play around with me.

248
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,120
That brat only thinks she's all
that because she's pretty.

249
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,522
I even know where she lives.

250
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,925
I'm going to do it tonight
and show it to everyone.

251
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:26,886
My gosh.

252
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:35,187
Next time, I'll get you cat food.

253
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,883
You eat so well.

254
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,400
Do you also live in this neighbourhood?

255
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,239
You looked down on me.

256
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:01,340
What?

257
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:15,623
I want an apology.

258
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,715
It seems like Kyung Seok likes
you way more than you like him.

259
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:32,220
That's not true.

260
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,436
We both like each other a lot.

261
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,253
A couple can't always
like each other equally.

262
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,146
The person who likes the other
person more tends to call more,

263
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:43,255
asks to meet more often,
and gets angry at times.

264
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,454
They get angry?

265
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,721
You guys haven't fought yet, have you?

266
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,323
I think we fought before
we started going out.

267
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,325
But I'm not sure if you
can call that a fight.

268
00:24:56,952 --> 00:24:58,130
Hey, Woo Young.

269
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,834
Soo A?

270
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:06,739
Yes, I live in the same
neighbourhood as her.

271
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:11,143
Have you seen Soo A today?

272
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,320
Why do you ask?

273
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,222
I want to ask something, but
I can't get a hold of her.

274
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,628
I know where she lives.
Should I go check up on her?

275
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,020
No, it's okay.

276
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,420
You don't need to go.

277
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,222
Okay, bye.

278
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:27,221
I don't want to put her in danger as well.

279
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,319
Gosh.

280
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,820
I called to file a report.

281
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,453
Was that Woo Young?

282
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,141
Yes, he asked if I've seen Soo A today.

283
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:45,077
He said he needs to ask her something.

284
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:50,082
Hey, Kyung Seok. Do you know
anyone who stalks Soo A at school?

285
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,753
Never mind. It's nothing.

286
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,291
Do you know where Soo A lives?

287
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:00,893
Yes.

288
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:09,373
What did I do to you?

289
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:13,505
I thought I only had a crush on you.

290
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,487
I need to gain a bit more
weight to look pretty.

291
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,004
I have the body of an
elementary school student.

292
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:18,610
Gosh, you've never dated anyone?

293
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,720
- Come on.
- Don't lie.

294
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,222
Are you okay?

295
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:33,019
So I was going to give up.

296
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,912
But you were interested in me too.

297
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,129
What?

298
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,331
You said hi to me first.

299
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,233
You smiled at me.

300
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,235
I did?

301
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,720
Hi, Dong Won.

302
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,112
Come to think of it, you
two have the same name.

303
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:55,314
His name is Dong Won too.

304
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,917
That cat's name is the same as mine too.

305
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,320
No one really uses it to name a cat.

306
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:05,519
You named the cat Dong Won on
purpose to draw my attention.

307
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:09,286
You enjoyed drinking the
beverage I gave you.

308
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,286
You wanted to take pictures with me too.

309
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:14,886
(To Soo A)

310
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:18,095
Thank you for the drink.

311
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,283
Let me take a picture of you in that gown.

312
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:23,829
Why just me?

313
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,445
Take one for Dong Won too.

314
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,254
And you said you liked
Kyung Seok in front of me.

315
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,102
You looked down on me.

316
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,609
You actually didn't like
Kyung Seok, did you?

317
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,113
What are you saying?

318
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:40,687
Now, just anyone is picking on me.

319
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,286
You're mistaken.

320
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,739
You flirted with me,

321
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:55,420
and why are you acting like you didn't?

322
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,753
Please help...

323
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,120
Apologize.

324
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,620
You won't?

325
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,087
You know what this is?

326
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,909
What's wrong?

327
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,513
I don't know, but I'm
having a bad feeling.

328
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,919
I think it came from that side.

329
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,987
Isn't that Dong Won?

330
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,087
Kyung Seok.

331
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,302
What have you done?

332
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,005
She didn't apologize.

333
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,406
What?

334
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,658
Soo A.

335
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:57,362
Soo A, are you okay?

336
00:29:57,952 --> 00:29:59,053
Are you okay?

337
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,600
He splashed something on me.

338
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,504
- What?
- I don't know.

339
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,706
He splashed something on me.

340
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,420
It's nothing.

341
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,620
It's okay.

342
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,115
Don't come.

343
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:19,718
Don't come.

344
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,021
Don't come.

345
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,724
Calm down.

346
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:28,827
It's nothing.

347
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,629
It's just water. See?

348
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:31,930
Check it yourself. It's water.

349
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:33,753
I said, go away.

350
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,138
I'm going to kill myself.

351
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:42,341
Soo A!

352
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,221
Put that down.

353
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:53,251
Soo A. Check.

354
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,520
Soo A, check.

355
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:58,820
Check yourself.

356
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,820
You're fine.

357
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,453
You're okay.

358
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,333
It's fine.

359
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,153
It's fine, Soo A.

360
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:15,841
Put that down.

361
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,487
Give it to me.

362
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,563
Are you hurt?

363
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:37,062
Try standing up slowly.

364
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:39,587
Let go of me.

365
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:45,270
Why are you here?

366
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:47,472
Why you of all people?

367
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:50,915
Why does it have to be someone
like you who's helping me?

368
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:54,279
I didn't ask for your help.

369
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:57,015
Why do you keep acting
like you're above me?

370
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:01,286
Why do you keep acting like
you're happier than me?

371
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:07,472
You aren't even prettier than me.

372
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:14,900
Please...

373
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,302
Please stop it now.

374
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:22,160
Seriously...

375
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,202
I hate you so much too.

376
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:27,904
You're seriously annoying, you know that?

377
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,081
It feels like I'm talking to a wall.

378
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,204
Right, I'm not pretty.

379
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,501
I did plastic surgeries.

380
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,122
Like you said, I wasn't happy
because I wasn't pretty.

381
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,720
But what about you?

382
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,026
Are you happy because you're pretty?

383
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,028
Are you happy?

384
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,731
Why does it have to be this way?

385
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:51,136
Why in the world do we
have to be like this?

386
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,553
We lose weight when we aren't even fat.

387
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,045
We throw up and do plastic surgeries...

388
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,416
...as if we'll die if we aren't pretty.

389
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,753
We give marks on people's faces...

390
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:16,421
...and fight ourselves.

391
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:27,172
Why on earth do we have to be like this?

392
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,034
I...

393
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,620
I don't want to do it anymore.

394
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:39,718
I really don't want to.

395
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,887
I...

396
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,853
I will...

397
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,959
...think over about what
will make me happy...

398
00:33:49,052 --> 00:33:50,829
...again from now on.

399
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,153
I will do that.

400
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:17,556
Yes, Soo A is all right.

401
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:21,187
She's surprised quite a
lot, but she is fine.

402
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,730
She's asleep now, so don't worry too much.

403
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,187
Sure.

404
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,120
Are you okay?

405
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,242
Yes.

406
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,849
Look.

407
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:50,655
Can I stay with Soo A for a while?

408
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,686
Don't you hate her?

409
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:02,467
I do.

410
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,254
You hate her too.

411
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,273
But you helped her a while ago.

412
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:12,677
- That's because...
- Can I do that?

413
00:35:13,952 --> 00:35:17,082
It's up to you. Do as you please.

414
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,386
Thanks.

415
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:29,120
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

416
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,380
What a horrible punk.

417
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,653
What will happen to him?

418
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:48,740
What do you mean? After
the police investigation,

419
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:50,226
he'll be kicked out of school.

420
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,517
We'll have to see how it'll
be dealt with legally.

421
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:58,352
Are you waiting for Mi Rae?

422
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:01,126
No, I was waiting for you...

423
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,428
...to go back together.

424
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,548
What's this sudden sweetness?

425
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,034
It's not all of a sudden.

426
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,671
I even brushed your teeth when
you were drunk the other day.

427
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,006
What?

428
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,085
- Let's go.
- Wait up.

429
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:19,577
What are you talking about? When?

430
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:20,788
When you came home drunk.

431
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,280
You brushed my teeth?

432
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:24,920
Yes, I made you breakfast too.

433
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,987
Oh, that day.

434
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,653
Come to think of it,

435
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:32,857
there was too much sweetness.

436
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:34,868
You didn't really brush
my teeth for me, did you?

437
00:36:34,952 --> 00:36:36,286
I really did.

438
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,463
You must have a strong stomach.

439
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:40,087
It was disgusting.

440
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,672
I thought you left.

441
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,524
I'll stay by her side.

442
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:57,623
Okay.

443
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:01,586
You can call me whenever you need me.

444
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,254
Okay.

445
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,087
You fool.

446
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:30,582
You turned out to be a
bigger fool than me.

447
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:34,185
Let's stop...

448
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,323
...living the way we used to.

449
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,506
What kind of photo was
uploaded on the internet?

450
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,837
I didn't get to see it.

451
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:57,052
It was a photo of someone from behind.

452
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:59,459
But we're not sure if it's Soo A or not.

453
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:03,220
I heard her face showed a little.

454
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,912
Her phone's turned off,
and she won't answer.

455
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:11,516
I thought we were friends, but
she hasn't even contacted me.

456
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,222
If you were her friend, why
did you badmouth her so much?

457
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,021
Hey, I'm not the one who
spread all those rumours.

458
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,923
Everyone already knew
about her throwing up...

459
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,519
...and meeting all the guys
from our department.

460
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,196
Anyway, Soo A has such a bad image now.
I feel sorry for her.

461
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,198
I heard she isn't even from a rich family.

462
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,100
Who told you that?

463
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,587
When we were at the lab,
Dong Won suddenly...

464
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,908
...came up to me at the bathroom and
told me that Soo A was a fake.

465
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:39,410
What does he know?

466
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,989
Isn't he a little weird?

467
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,920
Look at you. You have a habit
of badmouthing people.

468
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,117
- Just eat this.
- What?

469
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,220
He's really weird. He can't even
look at anyone in the eyes.

470
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,355
Gosh.

471
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:55,326
I hope he gets locked up in
prison for the rest of his life.

472
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:58,887
I know it makes you feel uneasy,
but don't worry too much.

473
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,686
He'll be prohibited from approaching
you once he gets released.

474
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,302
And you'll feel a lot
better if you continue...

475
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,720
...to receive psychotherapy.

476
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:12,486
I really don't get why I
need to go through...

477
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,412
...something like this.

478
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:16,653
From now on,

479
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,084
I don't think I'll be able to stay alone.

480
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:24,153
Do you have anyone you can lean on?

481
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:27,859
Is there anyone that can keep
you company for a while?

482
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,229
I thought I did,

483
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,833
but not anymore.

484
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,854
(Counselling Office 2)

485
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,436
Yes, of course. Okay.

486
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,343
Okay, bye.

487
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:51,349
Soo A.

488
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,256
What's wrong? Did you not expect me here?

489
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,862
I'll keep you company for a while...

490
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,165
...if you're not too
uncomfortable with that.

491
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:20,420
That place sells the best cakes.

492
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:22,612
Let's go eat there sometime.

493
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,586
No one knows about what happened.

494
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,254
I'm telling the truth.

495
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,419
We all know how to keep to ourselves.

496
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:39,130
That goes for Woo Young,
Kyung Seok, and Mi Rae.

497
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,754
You too.

498
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:50,742
I was going to keep to myself,

499
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:54,754
but I want to tell you this.

500
00:41:57,052 --> 00:41:58,449
Apparently,

501
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,953
Mi Rae really liked you at first.

502
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,024
She told me that you called her a friend.

503
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,621
She said that made her
feel really excited.

504
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,754
Thanks, Eun.

505
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,344
Don't mention it. It's no big deal.

506
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,822
I think he recognizes you.

507
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,754
Yes, I feed him from time to time.

508
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,321
He eats really well.

509
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,827
You must like cats.

510
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,664
Yes, I do.

511
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:55,706
Did you hear? Kyung Seok
and Mi Rae are a couple.

512
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,809
- Since when?
- Since the summer vacation.

513
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,711
They started dating as they
went to Kelun together.

514
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,082
I should've registered for that.

515
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:06,387
Do you think that would've made you
become Kyung Seok's girlfriend?

516
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,687
Mi Rae got really lucky.

517
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:11,989
I know, right? She must've saved
her country in her past life.

518
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:13,391
I feel so jealous.

519
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,927
- Right?
- I'm jealous too.

520
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,620
It's unbelievable.

521
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:19,997
Everyone, they're here!

522
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,519
- We finally have a couple.
- My gosh, you guys.

523
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,004
Are you guys really dating?

524
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,806
My gosh.

525
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,244
Yes, we're dating.

526
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,947
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

527
00:43:36,186 --> 00:43:38,015
Kyung Seok's so straightforward.

528
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,353
- I guess it's true.
- My goodness.

529
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:47,021
- Mi Rae.
- Ta-da.

530
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:49,060
I'm so jealous.

531
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,419
My gosh.

532
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,649
Don't kiss each other in class.

533
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,120
Gosh, stop it.

534
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:02,206
Okay, I won't kiss her in class.

535
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,109
Does that mean you'll
kiss her after class?

536
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:13,417
You didn't have to respond to that.

537
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,520
You told me to be nice to people.

538
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:26,251
I'm going to apply for an exchange
student program next month.

539
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,068
Is your GPA above 3.50?

540
00:44:28,153 --> 00:44:30,953
Hey, do you also think pretty girls...

541
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:33,371
...will naturally have bad grades?

542
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:36,641
I didn't think you'd be so biased.
I'm disappointed in you.

543
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,443
I never really thought
you were that pretty.

544
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:40,953
I was just asking.

545
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:42,847
What's for lunch today?

546
00:44:42,954 --> 00:44:45,082
Is that what you're most curious about?

547
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:48,653
Aren't you all curious about it?
You're just not asking.

548
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,987
Come to think of it, you may be right.

549
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,190
I always wonder,

550
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,387
but I never ask because I know you will.

551
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,793
Right?

552
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,264
Am I the only one who can't seem
to relate to what you're saying?

553
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,647
I'm sorry.

554
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,486
- For what?
- I'm sorry...

555
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:22,787
...for hurting you.

556
00:45:23,952 --> 00:45:25,890
Forget it. It's all in the past now.

557
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:29,193
You can't do anything about your feelings.

558
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,295
Yes, I know.

559
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,686
I can't control my heart as I want.

560
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:39,303
I keep thinking about you.

561
00:45:43,586 --> 00:45:44,886
Is that right?

562
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:47,820
How sad.

563
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,920
I don't really think about you.

564
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:54,962
There are those people who
look amazing at first,

565
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,623
but turn disappointing
after going out with them.

566
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,826
That's the case for you.

567
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,587
So I've gotten over with you quickly.

568
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:10,701
Don't be so upset. Bye.

569
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,787
Woo Young.

570
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:24,920
Do you have some time to talk?

571
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,517
There isn't anyone among seniors,

572
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,954
so they want me to be the student
president for the time being.

573
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,093
Tae Young, that punk.

574
00:46:36,787 --> 00:46:38,562
It can't be helped if there isn't anyone.

575
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:41,399
Don't cause trouble and do a
good job until the re-election.

576
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,400
Okay.

577
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,602
By the way, Woo Young,

578
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:52,910
do you know her? She's the prettiest
girl in the dance department.

579
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,712
I don't.

580
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,821
You don't? She's famous.

581
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,818
I'm not sure. Why do you ask?

582
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,388
She wants to have a blind date with you.

583
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:06,490
She came to our building for her
liberal arts class and saw you.

584
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,925
You'll do it, right?

585
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,228
- No.
- Why?

586
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,523
Have you gotten a girlfriend?

587
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,232
That's not it.

588
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:18,221
I'm the type who should fall
in love at first sight.

589
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,020
Tell her that I'm sorry.

590
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:27,052
She isn't like a model, but she's so cute.

591
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,887
He really is like a pine tree
in this area. He never changes.

592
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:38,208
Who in the dance department?

593
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:39,499
Goodness.

594
00:47:39,588 --> 00:47:42,189
Who is it? Set me up with
her instead of Woo Young.

595
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,108
Don't talk to me.

596
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:45,505
Hey.

597
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:49,133
Hey, both of us are at fault,
so let's make up already.

598
00:47:51,486 --> 00:47:53,104
Things never go well for me this year.

599
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:57,386
Hyun Jung.

600
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,911
Hyun Jung.

601
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:04,014
Are you going home?

602
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,087
Hello.

603
00:48:07,186 --> 00:48:08,686
What's wrong? Did something happen?

604
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,555
Will you buy me a drink?

605
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:14,687
Well, okay.

606
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:28,736
My senior said it was his friend,

607
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,574
so I thought my blind date was in his 20s.

608
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:33,778
But he turned out to be 33 years old.
I can't believe this.

609
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,981
It's not like we've grown to
like each other from friends,

610
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:41,487
how could a 33-year-old man asks
for a blind date with a freshman?

611
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,989
He has no conscience.

612
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,589
That was wrong of him.

613
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:48,487
He should've revealed his age first.

614
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,686
I mean, I'm not asking for much.

615
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,286
I want to meet an ordinary man and
have an ordinary relationship.

616
00:48:54,686 --> 00:48:56,187
Why is it so hard?

617
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,020
No relationship is ordinary in this world.

618
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,687
Every romance is special.

619
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:07,711
I wonder whom you'll go out with.

620
00:49:09,186 --> 00:49:10,720
I'm not sure about that either.

621
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:24,186
How will you change this exponential
function into a logarithm function?

622
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,886
Where did you get your surgeries done?

623
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,414
This is time to study.

624
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,820
Let's see.

625
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:34,205
If you change it into
a logarithm function,

626
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,920
it'll be like this.

627
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,709
Did you get all of them done at once...

628
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:40,520
...or one by one?

629
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,715
Can't you focus because of my face?

630
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,618
That's not true. You're the best tutor...

631
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,720
of all my past tutors.

632
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:51,722
Is that right?

633
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,724
Let's go back to the question.

634
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,487
Switch X and Y here.

635
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:58,820
Then...

636
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,287
...it'll be like this.

637
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,604
How much did it cost?

638
00:50:02,688 --> 00:50:05,102
Look here, seriously.

639
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:08,187
I'm explaining the concept here.
It's important.

640
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:09,106
Okay.

641
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,108
You remember symmetric transformation?

642
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,410
- Mi Rae.
- What is it again?

643
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,412
Can I go to the toilet?

644
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,413
What?

645
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,886
Okay, go ahead.

646
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,221
Calm down, Mi Rae.

647
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:32,819
You need to earn money to buy
Kyung Seok's birthday gift.

648
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:39,353
Your brother is like the legend itself.

649
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:41,286
He's that handsome?

650
00:50:43,675 --> 00:50:44,875
What do you want to have?

651
00:50:45,188 --> 00:50:47,878
It's on me, so tell me anything you want.

652
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:50,554
He's such an ideal brother.

653
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:52,249
By the way,

654
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:55,052
what is that?

655
00:50:57,142 --> 00:50:58,553
My ID.

656
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:01,091
(I'm Taken.)

657
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,087
I just arrived.

658
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,653
Hold on.

659
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:12,720
Take your time. I'll wait.

660
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,065
(Do Kyung Seok, Chemistry)

661
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:17,555
Hey, this is upsetting.

662
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,876
My goodness.

663
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:21,946
What is?

664
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,747
Am I just your college friend?

665
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:28,920
You mean this? I was
thinking of changing it,

666
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:31,522
but I wasn't sure how I should
change your name in my phone.

667
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:34,820
What's my name in your phone?

668
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,528
Whatever.

669
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:40,831
Come on. Tell me.

670
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:43,734
"Kang Mi Rae, Chemistry".

671
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,073
Are you upset?

672
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:52,954
Okay, I'll change it.

673
00:51:53,753 --> 00:51:56,347
What should we do on Saturday?
You have any plan with someone?

674
00:51:58,353 --> 00:52:01,486
If you don't, how about we go somewhere?

675
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,520
Okay.

676
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,587
This Saturday is your birthday.

677
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,496
Are you 33 years old?

678
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,488
- No.
- No?

679
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,767
I'm sure you'll be with Mi Rae that day.

680
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,268
Come visit me some time.

681
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:20,004
I'll buy you a drink.

682
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,877
When do girls get bored
of their boyfriends?

683
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,320
What?

684
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:32,520
What are you talking about? Are you
already on bad terms with Mi Rae?

685
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:33,884
No.

686
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,853
I'll call you later.

687
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,624
Bye.

688
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,827
You're here.

689
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:51,888
You're wearing the perfume I gave you.

690
00:52:51,991 --> 00:52:54,705
I spray only a little
at a time to save it.

691
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,207
I'll buy you another one
when you run out of it.

692
00:52:57,986 --> 00:52:59,209
When is your birthday?

693
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:03,313
Me? It's September 25.

694
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:04,715
Mine is in September too.

695
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:05,816
Really?

696
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,286
It's September 15.

697
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,988
I'm 10 days older than you.

698
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,526
All right, be my brother then.

699
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,031
Has she forgotten about it?

700
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,235
You can't work part-time forever.

701
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:28,005
Why don't you try your
father's business...

702
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,740
...and see how it is first?
You can quit after then.

703
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,875
You haven't even started yet.

704
00:53:34,386 --> 00:53:36,847
Do you want to visit my
dad's workplace with me?

705
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:42,586
Can anyone go there?

706
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:46,390
They welcome anyone there.

707
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:52,963
Why are we here at church all of a sudden?

708
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,432
Dad.

709
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,153
Hi, Yoo Jin.

710
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,653
Your father?

711
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,042
Who is she?

712
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,352
She's my junior from college.

713
00:54:08,952 --> 00:54:11,669
Hello, I'm Choi Jung Boon of
the chemistry department.

714
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:13,087
Chemistry?

715
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,152
Isn't Kyung Seok in that department too?

716
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,753
- That's right.
- Right.

717
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,919
You said business, so I thought...

718
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:27,520
You must be torn. I know how
much you like drinking.

719
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:31,135
I know. That's a problem to begin with.

720
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:37,220
I'm sorry to you and our children.

721
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:39,943
I've realized that I was wrong.

722
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,715
Tomorrow is Kyung Seok's birthday,

723
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:47,519
so how about we dine out all together?

724
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,920
I guess it's too soon for us to do that.

725
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,387
Is that what you wanted to say?

726
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,987
No.

727
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,154
I hope you know about this one thing.

728
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,669
-I've loved only two women in my life.

729
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:08,886
The 26-year-old Na Hye Sung,

730
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,187
and the 46-year-old Na Hye Sung.

731
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,381
I'm 47.

732
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:20,357
What?

733
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:29,187
Well...

734
00:55:40,413 --> 00:55:43,006
- Sang Won.
- Hey, why...

735
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,609
You fired me, so I'm no longer your staff.

736
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,253
Oh, yes. You're right.

737
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,652
About the thing with Kyung Hee, I'm
sorry I took it all out on you.

738
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,454
Gosh, don't you worry.

739
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:59,653
Thanks to you, I found a better job.

740
00:56:00,653 --> 00:56:03,271
I'll tell my new boss,
Congressman Kim Young Bae,

741
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:07,097
to take good care of you.

742
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,670
Take care of yourself, okay?

743
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,684
It's not her.

744
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,120
I thought it was her.

745
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:55,712
What? Did I sleep through the class?

746
00:56:58,015 --> 00:56:59,116
Mi Rae.

747
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:01,985
- Yes?
- Were you sleeping?

748
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,388
Yes, I must've dozed off.

749
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:05,989
You didn't answer my call.

750
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:09,192
I think I was fast asleep.

751
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:14,689
What's this?

752
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,035
What is this?

753
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:20,020
Someone must've left it
while you were asleep.

754
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:24,641
Come on. It must've been you.

755
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,554
- No, it wasn't me.
- Whatever. You can't fool me.

756
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,746
It really wasn't me.

757
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,054
It really wasn't you?

758
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,121
It's a perfume.

759
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,887
Someone else must know
you as well as I do.

760
00:57:48,587 --> 00:57:50,321
I have to go. I have a class.

761
00:57:51,286 --> 00:57:53,370
Call me after class.

762
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,087
I have a shift right after class.

763
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,077
What is going on?

764
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:02,179
Who left this here?

765
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,618
Gosh, it's Kyung Seok's birthday tomorrow.

766
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,370
It's been a while.

767
00:58:29,753 --> 00:58:31,541
How did you know that I work here?

768
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,812
It's all over social media.

769
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:37,814
You're famous.

770
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:44,321
Now, I browse the Internet
and even check those things.

771
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,056
Are you feeling better now?

772
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:50,927
It feels weird to hear you worry about me.

773
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,232
I'm taking a leave of absence.

774
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,054
At the moment, I don't know
when I'll return to school.

775
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:01,338
I figured I'd have no
reason to see you anymore.

776
00:59:01,453 --> 00:59:02,939
Is there something you want to tell me?

777
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:04,941
Yes.

778
00:59:06,486 --> 00:59:09,153
I thought I should get the
facts straightened out.

779
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:11,348
You see,

780
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:15,186
I never liked you, even for a second.

781
00:59:22,653 --> 00:59:23,660
I'll be off, then.

782
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:30,487
By the way, are you wearing perfume now?

783
00:59:30,787 --> 00:59:31,768
Yes.

784
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,406
I tried something I had never done,

785
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,588
and everything else became easy.

786
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:29,571
Hey.

787
01:00:29,686 --> 01:00:32,929
I don't even know who gave it to me.
What am I supposed to do?

788
01:00:33,019 --> 01:00:35,732
- Is it my fault?
- I didn't say anything.

789
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:38,352
What can I do? I'm dating a popular girl.

790
01:00:38,486 --> 01:00:41,204
I even changed your name on my phone.

791
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,606
Look.

792
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:46,987
(Kyung Seok)

793
01:00:51,453 --> 01:00:52,782
We're good now, right?

794
01:00:53,386 --> 01:00:54,987
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

795
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,087
Well, yes.

796
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,740
By the way, where are we going?

797
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,861
It's a beautiful day. We
should go on a picnic.

798
01:01:05,353 --> 01:01:07,130
- A picnic?
- Yes.

799
01:01:13,764 --> 01:01:15,131
A table for two?

800
01:01:15,253 --> 01:01:18,354
Yes, we have a reservation
under Do Kyung Seok.

801
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,577
I see. This way, please.

802
01:01:28,553 --> 01:01:30,120
Please have a seat here.

803
01:01:32,086 --> 01:01:37,020
(Happy Birthday, Kyung Seok.)

804
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,887
Hey.

805
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:42,486
You probably thought I forgot.

806
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,021
No, don't do that.

807
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:04,363
- Don't do it.
- Whatever, I'm doing it.

808
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:09,859
Happy birthday to you

809
01:02:09,986 --> 01:02:14,286
Happy birthday, dear Kyung Seok

810
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:19,154
Happy birthday to you

811
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:22,872
Blow out the candles.

812
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:28,578
Happy birthday.

813
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:32,182
And...

814
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:37,854
This is for you.

815
01:02:39,586 --> 01:02:41,170
You acted like you
totally forgot about it.

816
01:02:41,254 --> 01:02:44,270
I've always wanted to throw a
surprise birthday party like this.

817
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:46,386
There are so many things
you've wanted to do.

818
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:49,687
Thanks.

819
01:02:51,952 --> 01:02:53,519
Open it.

820
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,354
- Do you like it?
- It doesn't matter...

821
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:12,656
I like it.

822
01:03:14,153 --> 01:03:19,262
Oh, last but not least...

823
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,464
Ta-da!

824
01:03:29,753 --> 01:03:31,020
All right.

825
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:35,406
1,2,3!

826
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:46,089
You see,

827
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,225
I used to rate people on the streets...

828
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:52,329
purely based on their looks.

829
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,653
But I stopped doing that at some point.

830
01:03:58,022 --> 01:04:00,637
I thought everyone looked
at me and judged me...

831
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:04,641
...because I was doing the same to others,

832
01:04:07,986 --> 01:04:11,520
but I realized not that many
people are interested in me.

833
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:22,292
This would be a nice spot
to propose later on.

834
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:24,194
What?

835
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:30,133
Places like cafés either change or
shut down eventually, you know.

836
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,220
But it won't happen with this place.

837
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,976
Because of my parents,

838
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:43,120
I thought I'd never get married.

839
01:04:56,986 --> 01:05:00,463
You see, the hoodie...

840
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,987
I bought one for myself too.

841
01:05:04,586 --> 01:05:06,069
Good.

842
01:05:32,576 --> 01:05:34,697
Hey, the Do-Rae couple!

843
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,599
Don't make it so obvious, okay?

844
01:05:36,722 --> 01:05:38,554
- We'll be late.
- Hey, wait.

845
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,706
Let's leave, just the two of us

846
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,187
Wearing matching hoodies

847
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,111
Are you two on your honeymoon or what?

848
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,320
Should I not have bought one for myself?

849
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,720
Who cares? Do everything you want to do.

850
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:21,387
