1
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,463
You're wearing that perfume.

2
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:23,457
I used to hate this scent so much.

3
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:28,423
But I like it now.

4
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:00,632
You smell nice too.

5
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,598
But I'm not wearing any cologne.

6
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:09,295
There's this scent I always
smell when I'm around you.

7
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,930
By the way, what's this smell?

8
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,729
What smell?

9
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,231
Oh, no.

10
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,529
My gosh, we ruined it all.

11
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,330
All of the water has evaporated.

12
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:49,176
Don't touch it. It's still hot.

13
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:52,031
I'll clean it up.

14
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:56,964
Let's eat the cake after that.

15
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:00,897
Okay.

16
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:09,673
- Why is there only one candle?
- It's the first time for us both.

17
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,278
Shall we blow the candle?

18
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,285
Sure.

19
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,363
In 1, 2, 3.

20
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:31,251
Bottoms up.

21
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:32,452
What?

22
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,797
It doesn't contain any alcohol.

23
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,763
Here.

24
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:50,679
What is it?

25
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:52,564
I got it for you.

26
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,311
I wanted to thank you.

27
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:06,230
You waited for me even
when I rejected you twice.

28
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,415
Open it.

29
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,802
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

30
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,045
Hey, Yoo Jin.

31
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,422
- Where are you?
- What?

32
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,725
Are you okay? What
happened with that girl?

33
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,827
Why are you talking so loudly?

34
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,896
Because it's loud in here.

35
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,697
How did things go with her?

36
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,299
Didn't it work out?

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,797
No. It...

38
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,131
...worked out.

39
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,297
Then you should've told me.

40
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,076
Who is she?

41
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,782
I'll call you later. Bye.

42
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,752
Hey, wait.

43
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,889
Gosh, why won't he tell me who she is?

44
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,125
It was Yoo Jin.

45
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,471
He was with me when I drank that night.

46
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,096
What do you think he'll say...

47
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:27,267
...if he finds out?

48
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,074
He probably won't say much.

49
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,371
I'm sure he'll congratulate us.

50
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,664
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

51
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,982
To be honest, I'm scared
about people finding out.

52
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,284
But...

53
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,888
...it's kind of sad
that we have to keep...

54
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,391
...hiding from people.

55
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,930
And I feel sorry for
locking you up like this.

56
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,496
That's fine.

57
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,290
Should we just tell everyone?

58
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,279
I want to tell people.

59
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:11,478
Hyun Jung, Woo Young, and your mother.

60
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,663
We already have three
people rooting for us.

61
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:18,685
I think that's already
a good enough number.

62
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,930
Don't force yourself. I'm okay with this.

63
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,791
No.

64
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,627
I think I can do it.

65
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:18,178
You can do it, Mi Rae.

66
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,864
Good luck.

67
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,258
What are you doing?

68
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:32,759
What?

69
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,131
Nothing.

70
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,411
Hey, you guys are coming
to school together.

71
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,214
- Yes. We're...
- My stomach hurts. Bye.

72
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,037
He only mentioned that we came
in together, so it's awkward...

73
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,553
...to tell him that we're dating.

74
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,455
Don't try to force anything.

75
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:03,930
Just tell anyone who asks.

76
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,296
Okay.

77
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,965
But I feel like no one will ask.

78
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,530
I guess not a lot of people are
interested in us that much.

79
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,464
- Let's go.
- Okay.

80
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,965
- Hello.
- Hi.

81
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,058
Eun, are you close with Soo A?

82
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:38,963
Pardon?

83
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,463
What kind of person is she?

84
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,362
Why do you ask?

85
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,665
I saw her meeting Tae Young
in private a few days ago.

86
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,063
I saw them together.

87
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,068
What?

88
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:51,630
And apparently, Jung Yeob and Chan
Woo fought over her yesterday.

89
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,041
She told everyone that
she likes Kyung Seok,

90
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,243
but she's going around
meeting so many other guys.

91
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,830
Isn't that a little weird?

92
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,347
Well...

93
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,050
I'm not really sure.

94
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,997
Let's just ask Soo A directly.

95
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,390
Do you think she'll tell us the truth?

96
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,793
It's weird that Tae Young isn't
even answering my calls.

97
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,765
Soo A, where are you now?

98
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:29,596
Soo A.

99
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,578
You look pretty from every single angle.

100
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,949
Can you not take photos of me
without permission like this?

101
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,052
Isn't it illegal to take photos
without asking for permission?

102
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,054
Bye.

103
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,229
What is it that you need to say?

104
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,005
Do you still take photos of me
without asking for permission?

105
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,396
- What?
- You secretly took photos of me.

106
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,811
You're the one who uploaded all
those photos on the web, right?

107
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,197
No, that's not it.

108
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:11,084
I only sent it to a couple
of my close friends.

109
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,689
Should I report you to the cops
and make you become a criminal?

110
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:18,947
A criminal?

111
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:21,461
You had hopes about me
and took your revenge.

112
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,665
I knew you were a dork, but I
didn't know you'd be this bad.

113
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,067
Hey.

114
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,463
Is there something going on over there?

115
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,373
It's nothing.

116
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,349
Delete all the photos you uploaded.

117
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,552
And you better not tell anyone.

118
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,653
What?

119
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,063
My gosh, I can't believe this.

120
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,840
(Delete)

121
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,134
(Delete)

122
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,567
(Delete)

123
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,726
Hey, Soo A.

124
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,334
You never really liked Kyung Seok,

125
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,433
did you?

126
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,834
What are you talking about?

127
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,438
What a joke.

128
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,635
You've been learning how to
find your own personal scent.

129
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,716
And today, you'll finally be
making your own perfumes...

130
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,034
...by using what you've learned until now.

131
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,791
So go ahead and get started.

132
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,101
- Okay.
- Okay.

133
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,800
Don't think too much.

134
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,631
Just try making one using
your favorite scents.

135
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,935
I don't think...

136
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,938
I'm really fond of perfumes.

137
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,139
Why not?

138
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,409
I think the natural body scent
is better than perfume.

139
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,712
Natural stuff are always
better than artificial stuff.

140
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,900
Well, everyone has different tastes.

141
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,416
You'll be able to take the
perfume you make today.

142
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,322
And if you wait for about
three weeks before using it,

143
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,025
you'll be able to enjoy a deeper scent.

144
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,835
You guys can also try
making one as a couple.

145
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,903
Pardon?

146
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,378
Are you two not dating?

147
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,681
I'm sorry. I must've been mistaken.

148
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,752
Actually,

149
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,433
we are dating.

150
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,233
She's my girlfriend.

151
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,429
Right? You made me think I was mistaken.

152
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:11,867
My gosh.

153
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,846
My goodness.

154
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,548
Since when?

155
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,550
It hasn't been that long.

156
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,552
Awesome.

157
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,537
That must be why you came
in together this morning.

158
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,256
Since when?

159
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,224
It hasn't been that long.

160
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,826
You two stuck together all the time.

161
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,427
Were you on a date with her...

162
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,229
...when you ran into me and Yoon Byul?

163
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,632
- Yes.
- My goodness.

164
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,333
You should've just told us
that you came with her.

165
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,616
You got surprised for nothing.

166
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,800
I knew you'd end up like this.
You two look good together.

167
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,207
We look good together?

168
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,834
How jealous.

169
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,133
I know, I'm so jealous.

170
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,152
Seriously. I don't understand.

171
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,433
How could he date with her instead of you?

172
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,259
Do they really mean it by saying
how they look good together?

173
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,568
How ridiculous.

174
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,045
I was afraid for nothing.

175
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,947
So why were you afraid?

176
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,893
You suggested that we eat outside
to hold hands on the streets, no?

177
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,061
What?

178
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,967
Is there another reason?

179
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:57,270
Well, Soo A might feel
uncomfortable if we eat together.

180
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,876
Why do we have to care about her?

181
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,401
- Still.
- I've had this thought all along,

182
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,701
but I wish you were less nice.

183
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,653
I'm not that nice.

184
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,455
If you're nicer, it means you're a fool.

185
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:16,356
What?

186
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,859
- Hey.
- See? It doesn't hurt at all.

187
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,529
Sorry. Does it hurt?

188
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,934
See? It doesn't hurt.

189
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,539
- Stop it.
- What do you want to have?

190
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,500
Shall we go there?

191
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,413
Okay.

192
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,965
Are you okay?

193
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:54,719
What do you mean?

194
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:57,497
I just wondered if you were eating well.

195
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,800
It's not like I dated him.

196
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,101
I'm fine.

197
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,704
Right, it's fine.

198
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,407
His standard in women is
lower than I expected.

199
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,947
- What?
- Can you stop saying such stuff?

200
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,792
What a high pride of hers.

201
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,867
Don't you think she's more
strange the more you see her?

202
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:53,266
This really was nothing.

203
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,888
I'm sorry for troubling you until now.

204
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,701
It wasn't that much of trouble.

205
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,003
- It's delicious.
- Yes.

206
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,504
What are you doing?

207
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,073
What do you mean? He's stealing my food.

208
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:17,477
What?

209
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,634
Well...

210
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,182
Is it the exam period right now?

211
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,067
I see a lot of teenage students.

212
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,891
I used to be envious of those things.

213
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,696
I was envious of how
other boys and girls...

214
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,700
...went together for snacks after school.

215
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,666
It's not like I wanted
to hang out with boys.

216
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,810
I've never done stuff like that before.

217
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,299
- Then do it.
- What?

218
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,800
Do it. Do you still have
your school uniform?

219
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,019
Did you throw it away?

220
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,723
No, I might still have it at home.

221
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,491
Are you telling me to
wear my school uniform?

222
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,493
I might still have mine too.

223
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
- Are you going to wear it too?
- Do you want to do it alone?

224
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,178
Something seems to have
happened to your father.

225
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,781
I'll take good care of Kyung Hee.

226
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,183
And I believe you'll do fine on your own.

227
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,487
You may come to my house at any time.

228
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,733
("Mayor Do Sang Won's Daughter
Does a Show-off Streaming")

229
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,400
("Mayor Do Bought His Teenage
Daughter an Expensive Bag")

230
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,701
- Someone's coming down.
- Someone's coming.

231
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:04,234
The mayor isn't here, so please go back.

232
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,349
Where is he?

233
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,753
Did he know about his
daughter's streaming?

234
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,656
Did she buy the bag herself,
or did he buy it for her?

235
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,034
- Please answer.
- Tell us.

236
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,260
- Where is the mayor?
- Tell us.

237
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:16,195
- Please say a word.
- We want to know.

238
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,875
I can't hold this in anymore.

239
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,367
I've got to ask her why she met Tae Young.

240
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,564
She won't tell the truth
even if you ask her.

241
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,234
She won't admit that she coaxed him.

242
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,485
People will think you're venting
your anger out on her...

243
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,886
...for being dumped.

244
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:46,459
Still, I want to know at least
what excuses she'll make.

245
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,362
Hey.

246
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,898
What is she doing right now?

247
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,501
Did she just throw up what she ate?

248
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,083
She said she didn't easily gain weight.

249
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,452
So she was throwing up every food she ate.

250
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,654
To be honest, it didn't make sense...

251
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,524
...that she never gained weight
when she ate so much.

252
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,127
Right. She always went to brush
her teeth right after every meal.

253
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,063
That was actually for throwing up.

254
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,633
She's unbelievable.

255
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:04,370
I think you're mistaken.

256
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,573
I saw her throw up before,

257
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,476
and she said she easily
got an upset stomach.

258
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,578
I do that sometimes too.

259
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,581
No, she checked every single
stall to see if anyone was in...

260
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,283
...and threw up after that.

261
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,684
I saw it.

262
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,667
Goodness.

263
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:31,366
- Did you see her face just now?
- How scary.

264
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,473
Soo A, wait.

265
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,482
It's okay. Don't worry. No one...

266
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,886
You really burn me up.

267
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,590
- Are you feeling pity on me now?
- That's not it.

268
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,492
Now that you're going out with Kyung Seok,

269
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,301
do you think your class has gone up?

270
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,764
Do you think you've won?

271
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,804
How funny.

272
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:15,967
You wouldn't have been able to date him...

273
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,377
...without your plastic surgeries.

274
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,479
Even if he said he liked you,

275
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,682
you wouldn't have been
able to be with him.

276
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,082
You had a surgery on every
single part of your face,

277
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,388
so why do you act like you're unselfish?

278
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,691
Why don't you be honest?

279
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,900
Don't overstep your place
and worry about me.

280
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,299
I'm not worried about you.

281
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,873
And who are you to judge
how much I like him?

282
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:52,778
How do you know whether
I'd give up or not?

283
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,167
What if I do?

284
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:17,837
Hey, you're here.

285
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,943
Soo A.

286
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:30,583
She's being like that because we
caught her forcing herself to vomit.

287
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,451
She must be so embarrassed.

288
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,854
You're always with Soo A. You didn't know?

289
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,434
She was throwing up every time she
said she was brushing her teeth.

290
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,067
Soo A.

291
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,833
Hyun Soo A!

292
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,425
My gosh.

293
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,062
I've clearly warned you. Delete it.

294
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,265
- Delete what?
- Just delete it!

295
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,766
What are you talking about?

296
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,873
We took selfies because it's our
last day here. What's the matter?

297
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,680
Hey, Soo A.

298
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,701
Do you think I'm still chasing
you because I like you?

299
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,587
I only had three photos of you,
and I've deleted them all.

300
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,989
I closed the group chat too.

301
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,691
Are we good now?

302
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,295
Kyung Seok is a good judge of character.

303
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:52,464
It was wise of him to
choose Mi Rae over you.

304
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,469
Why do you have to treat Won Ho like that?

305
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,438
He really liked you.

306
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,440
I know things didn't work
out with Kyung Seok.

307
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:03,535
But are you taking it out on him?

308
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,117
I was wrong?

309
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,220
He'll obviously say that.

310
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,441
How strange.

311
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,746
There's no way it'd be here.

312
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,547
Actually, here it is.

313
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,565
I didn't even want to see this ever again.

314
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,604
Gosh, it's hot. I'm sweating.

315
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,587
She bought many bottles. How thoughtful.

316
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,192
Gosh, I ate way too much.

317
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,996
You're back.

318
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,783
Why are you sweating so much?
Did you exercise?

319
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,201
Yes.

320
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:11,370
Yes, I did some stretching exercises.

321
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,572
I feel like I've gained
some weight lately.

322
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:18,077
Hey, gaining 1 or 2kg doesn't
even show because you're tall.

323
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,513
With me, even 500g shows right away.

324
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,525
What brings you here?

325
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,333
To check up on what kind of mess I'm in?

326
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,034
("Daejin Daily")

327
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,266
Your mom has surely managed
to get back at me.

328
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:16,468
Kyung Hee shouldn't have run away
and taken off that darn mask.

329
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,570
Then this wouldn't have happened.

330
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:22,374
I told Kyung Hee to focus on
her studies, but she didn't.

331
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,393
She's been stuck in her room
wasting her time like that.

332
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,312
I feel bad for Kyung Hee.

333
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:28,881
What?

334
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,682
And I feel apologetic.

335
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,987
What do you mean?

336
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,733
She wants our affection and attention,

337
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,800
but I can't give her enough of either.

338
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,230
Mom didn't do anything.

339
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,133
It's all your fault, Dad.

340
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,605
Leave if you're here to talk nonsense.

341
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,234
Bye.

342
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:17,923
- You haven't eaten yet?
- No.

343
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,532
My gosh, are you guys
already having a fight?

344
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,668
No.

345
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,069
Then why didn't you eat with him?

346
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,567
Kyung Seok said he had
to go somewhere today.

347
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,178
Hey.

348
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,682
I told everyone.

349
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,616
About what?

350
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:39,318
That we're dating.

351
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,021
Hey, seriously? What did they say?

352
00:28:43,934 --> 00:28:47,092
Well, you know. They didn't
say much in front of me.

353
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,794
They congratulated us.

354
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,798
Thank goodness. That's such a relief.

355
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,538
I feel like I worry you all the time.

356
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,506
What are you talking about?

357
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,134
I put you through an ordeal
too back in the days.

358
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,034
You had to teach me math.

359
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,347
Oh, that's right.

360
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,949
I showed you how to solve
the question three times.

361
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,852
Hey, get it right. You
only had to show me twice.

362
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,854
Didn't I once go over
something five times?

363
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,234
Hey, I'd appreciate it if
you could get it straight.

364
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:34,206
Be quiet.

365
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,034
Quiet, please.

366
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:50,534
I'm doing all this to make
my old wish come true.

367
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,754
You look like a school uniform model.

368
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,413
You too.

369
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,316
You look pretty.

370
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,422
I didn't know you could
make such a remark.

371
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,026
Why did you come out so early?

372
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,228
I wanted to leave when Hyun
Jung was still asleep.

373
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,332
She might make fun of me.

374
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,167
By the way, where are we going?

375
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:41,168
I know that we've made
our relationship public,

376
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,800
but what if we run into someone we know?
That will be...

377
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,113
Shall we go to our middle school?

378
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,014
What?

379
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,067
I've always wanted to visit.

380
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,618
Really?

381
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,522
I have no good memories about that place.

382
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,228
Do you not like the idea?

383
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,634
Where do you want to go?

384
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,536
No, let's go there. I want to go there.

385
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,867
Let's go.

386
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:26,867
It's changed a lot, hasn't it?

387
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,353
Yes.

388
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,990
Some things changed, and
some things are the same.

389
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,163
Have we ever seen each other on the
streets back when we were students?

390
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,134
I never really walked around.

391
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,035
I was always stuck in
my room after school.

392
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,873
Me too.

393
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,334
Let's walk around today.

394
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,719
Are we allowed to hold hands
while wearing school uniforms?

395
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,735
Middle school kids are
always holding hands.

396
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:06,401
You're right.

397
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:15,567
He's so good-looking.

398
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,536
Which school's uniform is that?

399
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,267
It's not from our neighborhood.

400
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,334
She's wearing Jaryong
High School's uniform.

401
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,143
Do you really think they're
really high school students?

402
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,745
I guess so.

403
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,346
What's wrong?

404
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:30,148
Is there anyone you know?

405
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:34,367
No. And even if there was, they
wouldn't be able to recognize me.

406
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,967
The exams must be over in
this neighborhood as well...

407
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,867
...since they're all outside at this hour.

408
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,494
- Do you not like burgers?
- No, I like them.

409
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,401
Then why are you eating yours like that?

410
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:10,974
It's too thick.

411
00:33:16,814 --> 00:33:18,615
I won't look, so you can eat freely.

412
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,766
I really won't look.

413
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,967
Okay.

414
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:35,213
Did you take a bite?

415
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,449
Yes.

416
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,761
Was that your one bite?

417
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,767
You're cute.

418
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:01,540
Apparently, Jung Yeob and
Chan Woo fought over Soo A.

419
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,743
Soo A's gone completely insane.

420
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,433
Exactly. Okay, bye.

421
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,001
- Chan Woo.
- Hey.

422
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:14,052
I heard you got beaten
up even by Jung Yeob.

423
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,420
Who told you that?

424
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,922
Did Jung Yeob tell you that?

425
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,539
That's nonsense. I beat him up a lot more.

426
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,416
Everyone's talking...

427
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,395
...about how you fought with Jung
Yeob at Berlin over Soo A.

428
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,600
My gosh.

429
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,134
But what did Soo A do?

430
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,982
I heard she even made Tae
Young and Tae Hee break up.

431
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,971
- What? Really?
- Yes.

432
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,034
I heard it was a complete mess.
They broke cups and everything.

433
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,413
I didn't know she was going
around meeting all those guys.

434
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,297
And I really didn't know
she threw up after eating.

435
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,883
- Really?
- Yes.

436
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,785
She wanted to pretend like
she was naturally skinny,

437
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:48,086
so she threw up everything she ate.

438
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,403
You used to be her best friend.

439
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,800
Must you badmouth her about that?

440
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:53,892
Hey, I'm annoyed by all this as well.

441
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:57,195
People might think I'm weird
because I'm friends with Soo A.

442
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,033
You're already weird on your own.

443
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,334
What?

444
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:18,450
Did she just throw up what she ate?

445
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,967
She said she didn't easily gain weight.

446
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,854
So she was throwing up every food she ate.

447
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,657
Apparently, Jung Yeob and
Chan Woo fought over Soo A.

448
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:29,461
Soo A's gone completely insane.

449
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,443
(Yoo Eun)

450
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,834
(Yoo Eun)

451
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:15,291
Hey, it's Eun. What are you doing?

452
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:16,708
Why do you ask?

453
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,034
I was wondering if you
wanted to eat with me.

454
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,613
No.

455
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,416
Please leave me alone.

456
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,900
We don't have to eat. Can we meet?

457
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,887
Where are you? Are you at home?

458
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,702
What do you want to hear from me?

459
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:35,825
Nothing.

460
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,797
But you can talk if you want to.

461
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,701
I just feel like I'll regret it
if I don't reach out to you.

462
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm sorry if I annoyed you.

463
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:02,620
This is where you were cleaning.

464
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:06,024
Yes. It's when I misunderstood you.

465
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,201
You had every reason to.

466
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:13,834
Have you seen me in other places
other than here and the bus stop?

467
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,534
- Of course.
- Really?

468
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,237
You were always alone...

469
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,134
...just like me.

470
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:28,046
But why didn't you hang
around with Hyun Jung?

471
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,148
I felt sorry.

472
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:36,154
She got into a lot of fights
at school because of me.

473
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:41,359
So I just didn't hang
around with her at school.

474
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,266
We mostly hung out at her place or mine.

475
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,068
We also studied together.

476
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,634
Those were the times when
I could feel at ease.

477
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,644
I guess I should be nice to Hyun Jung.

478
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,047
How exactly?

479
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,852
By buying her food?

480
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:13,725
She's on a diet right now. She
wants to get a boyfriend.

481
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,131
The classrooms must be
empty right now, right?

482
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,733
Nothing's changed.

483
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:40,810
Of course. It's only been six years.

484
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,366
(Kang Orc)

485
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,699
It really is the same.

486
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,802
Was there always a
basketball court over there?

487
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,803
What?

488
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
Where?

489
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,018
I never got to do that either.

490
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,233
- You can do it.
- What?

491
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,324
Whenever guys played basketball,

492
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,926
girls would always cheer
for them beside the court.

493
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:25,129
I sometimes wanted to
watch the game as well.

494
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,232
But I never could.

495
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,936
Then you can do that today too.

496
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,538
What?

497
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,641
Let's go. You can cheer for me.

498
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,112
You're going to play basketball?

499
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,914
Right now?

500
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,717
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

501
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,988
Can I play with you guys?

502
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:53,199
Who's that?

503
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,496
- My gosh.
- He's so good-looking.

504
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,798
Is it okay if I play with you guys?

505
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,200
- Sure.
- Let's play with him.

506
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,400
How should we split teams?

507
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,169
- 2 against 3?
- Sure.

508
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,272
I guess he's really going to play.

509
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,574
Pass.

510
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,075
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

511
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,346
Good job.

512
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:18,516
Don't dare stop me.

513
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,553
- My gosh.
- He's so good.

514
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,656
Get the ball.

515
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,026
Come on. Block him.

516
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,831
Good job, Kyung Seok.

517
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,833
- No!
- Come on.

518
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,402
My gosh.

519
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,938
Hey.

520
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,540
- Gosh, seriously.
- Go, Kyung Seok!

521
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,542
Go, Kyung Seok!

522
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:51,449
You were really good.

523
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,352
You cheered pretty well as well.

524
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:56,554
I know, right?

525
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,958
I didn't know I'd be so good at cheering.

526
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,060
Excuse me.

527
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:04,562
Is he your boyfriend?

528
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,164
Yes.

529
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,232
- I'm so jealous.
- Me too.

530
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,006
Shall we go now?

531
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,716
- Bye.
- Bye.

532
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:30,922
But didn't she call him Do
Kyung Seok just a while ago?

533
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,633
Wait, I think I heard it too.

534
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,200
So it's right.

535
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,932
He's the legendary handsome
boy in our school.

536
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,835
Awesome.

537
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,037
What should we do now?

538
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,442
Shall we eat and watch a movie?

539
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:52,944
A movie?

540
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,547
You'll be teased all day long
if you go back in that uniform.

541
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:59,751
You should go late when she's asleep.

542
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,233
You're right.

543
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,433
Soo A.

544
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:34,434
Have you eaten?

545
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:35,820
What for?

546
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:38,233
I'd throw up after eating anyway.

547
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,400
I guess everyone in the school
thinks I'm a psycho now.

548
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,996
I even lied to you.

549
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,998
My grandma is alive.

550
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,202
I once told Kyung Seok
that I had a grandma,

551
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,200
so you must've known.

552
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,306
He isn't the type who'd say such a thing.

553
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,809
Right.

554
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,344
He's not even interested in me.

555
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,547
He cares only about Mi Rae.

556
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:08,719
Do you hate her because of Kyung Seok?

557
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:14,225
I don't think it's because of him.

558
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:16,227
The way I see it,

559
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:18,830
you've hated her from the start.

560
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,135
That's right. I did.

561
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:26,537
Why?

562
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:31,742
Becoming pretty isn't the only
purpose of doing plastic surgery.

563
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,745
They do it because they want
to do something after then.

564
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,550
I had a close friend when I was a
third grader in middle school.

565
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,054
She was good to me...

566
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:44,655
...like a servant.

567
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,158
She had an ordinary face,

568
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,061
but she got a double eyelid surgery
as she entered high school.

569
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,667
She became really pretty.

570
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:57,168
And she purposely dated a guy
whom I had a crush on...

571
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,172
...even when she knew that I liked him.

572
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,981
But you hated Mi Rae from the beginning.

573
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,500
Because she's pretty.

574
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,847
I guess I hated her because her
surgeries were done so well.

575
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:21,359
Hey, did you post...

576
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:24,262
...a picture of the beauty
in my department...

577
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,663
...somewhere online?

578
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,967
No, I showed the picture to others,
but I never posted it online.

579
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:33,466
By the way, I saw some pictures that
looked like her on the Internet.

580
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:34,872
She wore the same clothes too.

581
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:37,141
What are you talking about?

582
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,500
Hello?

583
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:55,927
Hi, Won Ho. What's up?

584
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,663
I have something to tell you.

585
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,064
What is it about?

586
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,267
Now?

587
00:45:24,317 --> 00:45:26,185
- Hello.
- Hi.

588
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,834
Did something happen?

589
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,801
I think so.

590
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:32,396
What is it?

591
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,098
You know who Hyun Soo A is, right?

592
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:37,101
Yes, I do. What about her?

593
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:41,439
She told some strange stuff to me,
so I wondered what it was about...

594
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,411
...and found this.

595
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,017
Who is this?

596
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,616
Her face isn't in the
picture, but it's Soo A.

597
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,787
I'm sure about it.

598
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,301
But she thinks I took this
picture and posted it online.

599
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:04,101
I took another picture of her before,

600
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:06,631
but it really isn't me.

601
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,400
Please help her.

602
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:22,877
We have to go catch the last
bus as soon as it ends.

603
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:24,482
Let's go right after then.

604
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:25,483
Okay.

605
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:28,966
I can't believe those
little punks are dating.

606
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,071
Don't mind it.

607
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,813
They won't make it to
college like that. Gosh.

608
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:22,073
Gosh, I hope my daughter isn't like that.

609
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:24,233
Goodness.

610
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,500
Whom did you mean just now?

611
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:36,454
I was talking to myself.

612
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,200
You've changed a lot.

613
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,234
I told you before. I usually
don't get intimidated.

614
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,324
Didn't you say you don't
usually get intimidated?

615
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:30,177
I'm not intimidated.

616
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,667
Why are you eating that alone?

617
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:00,137
It's gross.

618
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,039
Are you a beggar, Soo A?

619
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:07,445
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors
and make the loser kiss Soo A?

620
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,201
I might get sick.

621
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,516
I heard her parents abandoned her.

622
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:14,601
Poor thing.

623
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:16,620
But why?

624
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:18,022
- Because she's dirty?
- Because she's dirty?

625
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:19,800
- Telepathy.
- We thought the same.

626
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,426
How funny.

627
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,028
I would abandon her too
if I were her parents.

628
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:25,834
Same here.

629
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,967
Don't you wash yourself?

630
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:29,447
I don't know about anything else,
but make sure you wash yourself.

631
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,533
You can go home alone, right?

632
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,837
Finish that before you go.

633
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:42,934
Don't go.

634
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,343
Don't abandon me again.

635
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,148
I can't do that.

636
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:54,952
Why?

637
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:01,458
You have no friends, but
I hope you do well.

638
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:03,767
Mom.

639
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,564
Mom.

640
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,676
Hey, is that Hyun Soo A?

641
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,277
That's Hyun Soo A?

642
00:51:21,066 --> 00:51:22,379
My goodness.

643
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:23,981
It is her.

644
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,483
I didn't know she was so pretty.

645
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:29,168
I know, right? Why did she
look like that before?

646
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,834
I'm pretty?

647
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:33,557
Your skin is so fair. Are you
wearing makeup or something?

648
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:34,849
No.

649
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:38,149
Don't you think Soo A is the
prettiest girl in the entire school?

650
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:39,663
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

651
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,665
Soo A, this guy has a crush on you.

652
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:44,268
- Hey, cut it out!
- What was that about?

653
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,237
Hey, did you see that?

654
00:51:47,322 --> 00:51:50,134
- Her face looked so cute just now.
- I know, right?

655
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:52,810
To be loved,

656
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,299
I must be pretty and cute.

657
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,401
At the same time, I mustn't
know that I'm pretty.

658
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:03,633
I must be obedient, and I
should never be too smart.

659
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:07,333
I must always smile and agree to others.

660
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,100
I must always be kind and friendly.

661
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,386
Let's go.

662
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,689
Right, the bus. We have to hurry.

663
00:52:48,886 --> 00:52:50,300
We're two minutes late.

664
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,703
Gosh, what should we do now?

665
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,306
- Should we take a taxi?
- All the way there?

666
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:59,801
Hang on a second. Let me see
how much cash I have on me.

667
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,433
I have 26 dollars. How much do you have?

668
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,367
If we're short, I can
bring money from home.

669
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,824
Then I'll call a taxi.

670
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,168
(Searching for a taxi nearby)

671
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,207
(No taxis currently available)

672
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,110
- There are no taxis available now.
- Then what should we do?

673
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,817
Then should we just go to a sauna?

674
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:41,018
A sauna?

675
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,022
Minors can't use our
facilities from 10pm to 5am.

676
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,925
We're actually college students.

677
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:49,333
Can't we show you our school ID cards?

678
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,167
(Sauna, Open for 24 hours)

679
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,532
I've only been here with my mom,
so I didn't even think about that.

680
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,633
Are there any cars going to Seoul?

681
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,507
Okay, thank you.

682
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,301
Shall we just go to my parents' place?

683
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,702
It's probably not a good idea, right?

684
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,100
- You should go home.
- Then what about you?

685
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,500
I'll wait a few hours
and take the first bus.

686
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,094
- Then I'll wait with you.
- Just go home.

687
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,396
No, I don't want you to wait alone.

688
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,800
Let's just go to my parents' place.

689
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,604
We have no choice.

690
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,266
- Just go by yourself...
- Hi, Mom.

691
00:54:40,767 --> 00:54:42,401
You're still awake?

692
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,017
Where are you now?

693
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:50,087
We're at your grandmother's
70th birthday party.

694
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:52,990
We can't go home right now because
your dad has been drinking.

695
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,492
- Who is it?
- Mi Rae.

696
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,094
My pretty daughter?

697
00:54:57,999 --> 00:54:59,696
Mi Rae!

698
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,301
Dad sounds really drunk.

699
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,203
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

700
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,021
Then when will you come home...

701
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,434
I mean, when will you go home?

702
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,309
Mi Rae, Mi Rae!

703
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,611
When can we go to a karaoke
lounge together again?

704
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:16,613
Go in. Go inside, okay?

705
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,416
Gosh. By the way, why did you
call me at this late hour?

706
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:21,018
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

707
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,933
Yes, don't worry. Everything is fine.

708
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:25,489
Yes.

709
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,193
Then tomorrow, come home... I
mean, get home safely tomorrow.

710
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:32,996
Wait until Dad sobers up completely.
All right.

711
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,803
My parents aren't home now.

712
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:53,765
This is it.

713
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:01,600
Did you live here back then too?

714
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:05,030
Yes, we've been living here since
I was in elementary school.

715
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,840
Shall we go in?

716
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:40,773
This is where my family lives.

717
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:44,252
I see.

718
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,566
Have a seat.

719
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:50,801
Okay.

720
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:03,901
I'll go bring something to eat.

721
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:05,400
All right.

722
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:14,034
(Squid)

723
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:17,268
This is squid.

724
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:20,733
This is also squid.

725
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:24,001
This is beef jerky.

726
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,600
Gosh, what's going on?
They're all bar snacks.

727
00:57:29,233 --> 00:57:30,767
Are there any chips?

728
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,221
(Tomato Ketchup)

729
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,027
Soju.

730
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:51,735
Do you want some soju?

731
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:53,437
Sure.

732
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:06,450
I couldn't find many snacks to eat.

733
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,134
There's a lot here.

734
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:11,655
Isn't the uniform uncomfortable?

735
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:13,857
No, it's fine.

736
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,460
Yours must be more uncomfortable.

737
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:18,762
Get changed into comfortable clothes.

738
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:22,767
I'll be right back.

739
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,667
Hey!

740
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,095
Hey, you can't.

741
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,597
- Come on. You can't see that.
- Why not?

742
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,299
- Give it back.
- I'll just take a quick look.

743
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,434
I know what you used to look like.

744
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,549
What's there to see? Give it back.

745
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,750
No, you can't see it. Gosh, give it back.
Give it back.

746
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,941
- Just for a second...
- No, don't be like this.

747
01:00:09,988 --> 01:00:11,174
Are you mad at me?

748
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,677
Yes, I am.

749
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,714
I'm sorry.

750
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:50,514
But there's something I'm curious about.

751
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:59,456
How can you like me when you
know how I used to look like?

752
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:03,167
If I had kept that face,

753
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:07,130
would you still have liked me?

754
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:15,268
You're just you.

755
01:01:19,152 --> 01:01:20,552
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

756
01:01:26,714 --> 01:01:27,817
But...

757
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,534
I do miss your old face from time to time.

758
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,244
Then just for a moment...

759
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:59,767
You can see it for like a split second.

760
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,689
No, it's okay. I don't have to
see it if you don't want me to.

761
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,132
Just for three seconds.

762
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,225
No more than that, okay?

763
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:44,227
Here we go.

764
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:50,934
One, two...

765
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:53,737
Three.

766
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:03,546
If you still like me after seeing this,

767
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:07,934
that means you really like me.

768
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:52,934
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

769
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:55,068
I had my first kiss.

770
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:56,600
- Who is he?
- Mi Rae's boyfriend.

771
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,995
That guy is super handsome!

772
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,197
Her phone is still off. I
can't get a hold of her.

773
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,799
It was obviously taken
without her consent.

774
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,400
Why can't you delete it?

775
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,402
A victim?

776
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,600
No, I don't want people to
think of me weird like that.

777
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:10,800
I think Kyung Seok likes you more.
Am I right?

778
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:12,909
This would be a nice spot
to propose later on.

779
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,277
You said hi to me first.

780
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,467
You smiled at me.

781
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,467
Do you know what this is?

782
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,281
Have you seen Soo A today by any chance?

783
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:19,967
What did you do?
