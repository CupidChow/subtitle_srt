1
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:05,292
We're seeing each other now.

2
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:14,882
Congratulations.

3
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:16,950
I wish you guys all the best.

4
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:41,928
You wanted to keep it a secret.

5
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,244
She probably won't tell anyone.

6
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,961
You dating me right after rejecting her...

7
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,260
...must've crushed her pride.

8
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:57,291
I'm glad that you're smartening up.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,194
- What?
- I also wanted to tell Soo A...

10
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,359
...that we're seeing each other now.

11
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,870
I don't want to make you lie.

12
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,676
I'll be the liar.

13
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,508
You kept it from everyone
because of me anyway.

14
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,110
It's all right. We should
do everything together.

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,446
Don't do it alone.

16
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,521
Hey.

17
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,657
Have you been researching
cool things to say to girls?

18
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,260
I just said what came to mind.

19
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,765
Should I do some research?

20
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,893
When you layer too many different scents,

21
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,115
the scents can clash...

22
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:58,318
...and end up smelling awful
or too strong together.

23
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,654
If you prefer feminine,
sophisticated scents...

24
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,775
What should we do after this?

25
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,257
You should add a citrus note.

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,660
If you prefer sweet, girly scents,

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,376
you should add refreshing
notes like grapefruit.

28
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,065
Well, I'll be fine with whatever.

29
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,068
(Kang Mi Rae)

30
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,173
I didn't think he'd be used to texting,

31
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,209
but he can text with one hand.

32
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:27,514
Then let's grab dinner first.

33
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:30,193
Sure.

34
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,587
Okay.

35
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,593
I'll send you the address.

36
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:46,593
Mi Rae, are you still thinking?

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,601
Pardon me?

38
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:51,321
Oh, I'm thinking of going with
something that'd be good for autumn.

39
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,839
For autumn?

40
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:55,042
What kinds of scents are you thinking?

41
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,744
Well...

42
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:03,050
I'm thinking of using woody, floral
scents or something citrusy.

43
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,268
That will suit the pleasant autumn breeze.

44
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,256
Yes, thank you.

45
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:16,897
Let's meet in front of the building.

46
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:18,799
That's risky.

47
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,393
Then shall we meet halfway there?

48
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,604
Where? On the street?

49
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:27,607
Or... Shall we just meet there?

50
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,710
Yes, that'd be the best.

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,812
Are we in a spy movie or what?

52
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,215
Who keeps texting you?

53
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,416
What?

54
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,119
My mom.

55
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:41,588
Your mom? Is everything
okay with your family?

56
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,491
Yes, they're fine. It's nothing serious.

57
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:46,693
Every family has problems, you know.

58
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,095
That's true.

59
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,255
(I have a crush on you.)

60
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:28,193
Yes, hello?

61
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,138
Hey, Yoon Byul. It's me, Woo Young.

62
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,849
- Just sit. Why did you get up?
- Oh, okay.

63
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,655
- What do you want to drink?
- It's okay. Let me order.

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,624
No, I should treat you since I'm older.

65
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,226
Then I'll get iced caffe mocha.

66
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,427
With whipped cream on top?

67
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,630
- Just a little bit.
- Just a little bit?

68
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:00,526
Iced caffe mocha with just a
little bit of whipped cream.

69
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,194
Thank you.

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,027
- Why were you at school?
- I'm taking a summer class.

71
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:25,225
Oh, right. You told me that.

72
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:31,665
- What did you want to talk about?
- What?

73
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,468
Well, it's about...

74
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:39,773
- The other day, you gave me...
- My love letter?

75
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:41,961
Yes.

76
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:46,660
I did some thinking after
reading that letter.

77
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,950
It's okay. You can be honest with me.

78
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,253
Okay. I'll be honest.

79
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,256
To be honest,

80
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,025
I think you're very cool.

81
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,263
But I'm not your type, right?

82
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,364
What?

83
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,835
Yes.

84
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,938
Okay. There's nothing I can do about it.

85
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,626
I'll go after I finish this.

86
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,942
You can take your time.

87
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,226
Okay.

88
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:31,758
I've also been heartbroken
a couple of times,

89
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,261
and I found out that
time heals all wounds.

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,263
It's not always the same with everyone.

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,465
Some people take much longer to heal.

92
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,667
Yes, you're right.

93
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,793
Are summer classes fun?

94
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:48,275
No, they're not fun.

95
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:50,176
Oh, I see.

96
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,084
I hope you don't get drunk and
end up ruining your health...

97
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:00,787
...because I made you upset.

98
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,690
I'll try not to.

99
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,793
I'm sure you'll do well.

100
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,402
I'll go now.

101
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,627
Okay.

102
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,809
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

103
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:31,017
Are you really over Soo A?

104
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,526
I'm not nuts.

105
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,921
Why would I like someone when she
told me that she likes Kyung Seok?

106
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:37,524
Bye.

107
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,826
Okay, bye.

108
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,333
See you.

109
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:49,927
Won Ho must be upset...

110
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,238
...after you told everyone
that you like Kyung Seok.

111
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:55,542
Let's not talk about Kyung Seok anymore.

112
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,059
Sorry.

113
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,948
Let's go eat.

114
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,317
Sure. What should we eat?

115
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,969
What kind of perfume are you looking for?

116
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,138
Men's perfume.

117
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,906
We have a new product that
we recently launched,

118
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,608
and it has a very neutral scent.

119
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,110
You should try this.

120
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,411
Okay.

121
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,495
It's nice.

122
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,687
- Should I get you one?
- Yes.

123
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:51,197
It must be for your boyfriend.

124
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,535
Yes, it's for my boyfriend.

125
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,138
If you tell me his initials,

126
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,239
we can engrave it for you.

127
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,940
Oh, really?

128
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,010
Then...

129
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,103
please engrave D, K, S...

130
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:11,518
...with a heart at the end.

131
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,119
Okay, I'll do that.

132
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,138
Welcome.

133
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,297
Here's your check.

134
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,504
It's 187 dollars.

135
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:27,901
Okay.

136
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,071
Please sign here.

137
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,473
Okay.

138
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,671
Thank you.

139
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,434
Do you think we'll run into
our school friends here?

140
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:15,823
Mi Rae.

141
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,184
You stand out too much.

142
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,143
- Why?
- It's like you're a spy.

143
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:26,750
Oh, really?

144
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,595
We already watched a movie,

145
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,137
ate dinner, and drank together once.

146
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:33,800
But we had a good excuse back then.

147
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,971
We had to do homework for a class.

148
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,203
Was it an excuse for you as well?

149
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,203
What do you mean?

150
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,208
I only used that as an excuse
to watch a movie with you.

151
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:51,408
Should we order?

152
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:52,813
Yes.

153
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,780
I want spaghetti aglio e olio.

154
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:01,394
You must really like that.

155
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,118
That's what you ordered last time.

156
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:05,903
I always tend to order the cheapest menu.

157
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:09,289
That sounded so cheap.

158
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,999
To be honest,

159
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,903
I was worried that day because
I didn't have a lot of money.

160
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:16,309
Really?

161
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:19,379
Then why did you insist
on paying for everything?

162
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,080
Because I'm the one who
suggested that we should eat.

163
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,870
Would you like to order?

164
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,687
Two spaghetti aglio e olios.

165
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,789
I want cola. What about you?

166
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,470
Me too.

167
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,992
Two glasses of cola, please.

168
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,602
Okay.

169
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,984
I need to go to the bathroom.

170
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,977
Okay.

171
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,886
We should eat something
nice and cheer up...

172
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:01,878
...since we're both heartbroken.

173
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:04,290
Eating something doesn't
exactly cheer me up.

174
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,692
Why not?

175
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,695
- Hey.
- Kyung Seok.

176
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:12,999
Hello.

177
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:15,501
What are you doing here alone?
Did you come with someone?

178
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,570
No, I came here...

179
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,372
I came here alone.

180
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,473
Alone?

181
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,674
I came to eat.

182
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,411
Okay. Enjoy your meal.

183
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,303
Bye.

184
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:03,136
My face is burning as if I drank alcohol.

185
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:08,655
My heart beats so fast even when
we started to see each other.

186
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,858
This is driving me crazy.

187
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,239
I chose what I want.

188
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,737
I want this.

189
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,436
What about you?

190
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,203
Don't you think this would taste better?

191
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,278
I want this.

192
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,488
Gosh, what am I going to do?
What should I do?

193
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,737
You're awfully obedient to
someone who rejected you.

194
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:55,501
Did you decide not to drink
because Woo Young...

195
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:56,784
...told you to take care of your health?

196
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,272
I think so. He was
really worried about me.

197
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,903
It felt like I should listen to him.

198
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,776
He's a great senior.

199
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,204
Excuse me.

200
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,070
Can you deliver this to the ladies'?

201
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:22,374
What?

202
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,331
Please hurry.

203
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:27,033
Oh, okay.

204
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,066
What should I do?

205
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,870
Excuse me.

206
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,289
That's my bag.

207
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,646
Your friend asked me to give this to you.

208
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,151
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:23,869
My gosh.

210
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,669
Hello?

211
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:39,203
Tae Hee just went to the bathroom.

212
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,503
What?

213
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:53,372
Don't say anything, and just listen.

214
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,051
I'll try to distract the seniors.

215
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,459
You can use that chance
to get out of here.

216
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,672
This really feels like a spy movie.

217
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,574
Bye.

218
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,476
Bye, see you.

219
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,185
We're seeing each other now.

220
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,454
How dare she...

221
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,259
(Tae Young)

222
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,767
Hello?

223
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:46,869
Now?

224
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,575
I have something important to ask you.

225
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,379
- What is it?
- Let's talk in person.

226
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,548
Spare me a minute.

227
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,594
He must be eating those two dishes alone.

228
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:12,164
You can do that too.

229
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,234
Still, I don't come
alone for two dishes...

230
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,436
...unless I come with 2 other
people and order 3 dishes.

231
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,143
Can I sit here for a second?

232
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,646
Sure, sit down.

233
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,350
What did you order?

234
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,250
- Us?
- Yes.

235
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,756
I ordered rose pasta.

236
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,458
- I ordered spaghetti aglio e olio.
- Me too.

237
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,664
- Just two of that?
- Yes.

238
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,266
So you eat more than you look.

239
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,735
I eat a lot from time to time.

240
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:51,337
How much?

241
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,543
Let's be honest. The portions at
barbecue restaurants are too small.

242
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:58,544
What?

243
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:01,816
Enjoy your food.

244
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,950
What was that? Did he come here
to ask us what we're having?

245
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:08,649
That was strange.

246
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,656
I guess he's gotten the desire to
communicate with the society...

247
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,659
...after being immersed in his own world.

248
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,563
- You think so?
- Yes.

249
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,450
Kyung Seok.

250
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,071
Are you okay?

251
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,478
I'm sorry. You couldn't
eat any, could you?

252
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,246
You couldn't even have a bite.

253
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,849
I'm not hungry right now.

254
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:41,451
- Shall we go?
- Where else should we go?

255
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,416
Are you a meerkat or what?

256
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:52,131
Oops, sorry. It's bothersome, isn't it?

257
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:02,308
- Let's go home for today.
- What?

258
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,610
I'm worried you might keep being anxious.

259
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,813
Sorry.

260
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,116
We have a lot of time to spend together.

261
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,717
What did you tell them?

262
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,217
Did you tell them you came alone?

263
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,026
Yes.

264
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,329
I made you lie in the end.

265
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,131
It's nothing bad.

266
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:28,116
They must've thought you were strange...

267
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,835
...for going to such a place alone.

268
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,338
It's okay. Don't mind it.

269
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,142
I wish I could live...

270
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,812
...without minding others' attention.

271
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,318
I'm okay.

272
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,123
I'm actually used to that.

273
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,529
I've lived that way
throughout my entire life.

274
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,234
- Let's go.
- Okay.

275
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:22,273
- Hello.
- Hello.

276
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,944
- You look so cool.
- Oh, thank you.

277
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,462
- Hello.
- Mr. Mayor.

278
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,264
Please work hard to revive...

279
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,465
...our economy.

280
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,368
I will work hard. My goal is...

281
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:44,777
What's this?

282
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,779
(Is she Do Sang Won's daughter?)

283
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,381
(It's been revealed Mayor Do's
daughter is a famous streamer.)

284
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,183
I'm doomed.

285
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,483
I'll do my best. Thank you.

286
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,188
Thank you.

287
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:59,191
- Do Sang Won.
- Go for it.

288
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:04,997
Please take a look at this, sir.

289
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,601
What is this?

290
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:11,504
She seems to have been streaming online.

291
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:13,498
Her nickname is Lovely Do.

292
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:15,407
The problem is, her broadcast is about...

293
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,016
...showing off her wealthy life.

294
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:39,954
What is it that you want to ask?

295
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,933
First off,

296
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,303
I want to thank you.

297
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,617
I'm usually indecisive.

298
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:50,709
But...

299
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:53,512
After hearing your opinion that day...

300
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,115
...gave me courage.

301
00:21:58,716 --> 00:21:59,718
Thanks.

302
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,822
- What courage?
- You told me...

303
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,224
...to follow my heart.

304
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,626
So...

305
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:14,633
This.

306
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,536
I was reminded of you and bought it.

307
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:19,438
It's a necklace.

308
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,043
- Tae Young.
- Yes?

309
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,228
Why would you be reminded of me...

310
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,116
...and buy such a thing?

311
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:29,315
What?

312
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,816
It's uncomfortable. I don't
understand why you're doing this.

313
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,892
From how I remember, I thought we were...

314
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,895
...on the same page.

315
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,057
What do you mean by that?

316
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,469
You asked me what I'd do if I found out...

317
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:53,772
...that someone else had a crush on me.

318
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,477
Don't tell me you thought
I had a crush on you.

319
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,984
What I was trying to say was that...

320
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:08,187
...if you get swayed by someone else,

321
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,788
then you probably don't like the
person you're seeing that much.

322
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,559
To be honest, I wanted you
to be happy with Tae Hee.

323
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:23,936
What's wrong?

324
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,805
Please excuse me.

325
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,608
What is it?

326
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:48,127
What's going on?

327
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,629
What's going on between them?

328
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:10,716
You said you could be my drinking
buddy if I was in trouble.

329
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,820
Of course. I'm a huge fan of yours.

330
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:18,290
I see.

331
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:26,098
Actually, I'm not so experienced
with dating either.

332
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:29,618
I'm concerned with a lot of
things about our relationship.

333
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,437
What exactly?

334
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,305
I'm not sure...

335
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:36,575
...about my feelings for her.

336
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,683
Of course, she's a good girl.

337
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,384
She's cute.

338
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:48,487
It's right that I have
positive feelings for her.

339
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:50,189
But...

340
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,950
I don't know.

341
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,863
How do you think you will feel...

342
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,768
...if you find out that someone else...

343
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,150
...has a crush on you?

344
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,242
What?

345
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,049
Do you think you'll be swayed?

346
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,248
Well...

347
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:19,752
I don't know.

348
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,155
I'm not sure,

349
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:27,860
but isn't it better to follow
your heart than your thought?

350
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,034
Am I the weird one here?

351
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,483
Am I?

352
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,250
This is crazy.

353
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:56,260
What's so crazy?

354
00:25:56,345 --> 00:26:01,179
You and Kyung Seok held hands and...

355
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:04,779
You little brats. What's the next step?

356
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,633
- What do you mean?
- I'm not ready for that yet.

357
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,535
- Ready for what?
- It's too early for me.

358
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:12,137
What are you talking about?

359
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,139
You've gotten so brave, Mi Rae.

360
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,874
You said you could never date Kyung Seok.

361
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,843
Gosh, cut it out.

362
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,545
Don't tell anyone.

363
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:21,547
You'll hide it from people
in your department?

364
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,348
Yes, of course.

365
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,219
People were already so interested
in him, and it's gotten worse.

366
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,788
Everyone is wondering whom he's
seeing after rejecting Soo A.

367
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:31,790
If people find out that it's me...

368
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:37,162
But what if they find out?
What will you do then?

369
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,599
No idea. It's not like I thought
about those things in advance.

370
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:45,971
Right, it's fine. Hey, don't
think about anything else.

371
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,974
For now, just focus on your
relationship with Kyung Seok...

372
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,384
- and lovey-dovey things you'll do.
- My gosh.

373
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,680
Lovey-dovey, my foot.

374
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,083
- Stop it. Enough, okay?
- You two will be all lovey-dovey.

375
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:00,385
- Hey, wait. Hang on.
- What?

376
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,387
- Hang on a second.
- What? What is it now?

377
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,916
Well... Does Woo Young know?

378
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:47,065
I guess you're busy.

379
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,902
Yes, I have to go over a thesis.

380
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,308
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

381
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,576
No, well...

382
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:01,713
Yes.

383
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,782
What is it?

384
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,617
We can talk another time if you're busy.

385
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,820
I am busy now, but go ahead.

386
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,724
It's about Mi Rae.

387
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,609
What's wrong? Are things not going well?

388
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,794
No, it's not that.

389
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:18,197
Things are...

390
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,199
...going well.

391
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,717
It went well.

392
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:29,808
Is that why you wanted to talk?

393
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,116
Do you feel bad for me?

394
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,547
No, I don't really have...

395
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,050
- ...any reason to.
- Right, you don't.

396
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,152
But why are you stammering now?

397
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,454
Congratulations.

398
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,726
But please don't tell anyone at school.

399
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,949
Why?

400
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,662
Just because. Please don't tell anyone.

401
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:52,849
I'm going to bed.

402
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:56,134
Good night. I hope you
have a dream about Mi Rae.

403
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,910
"Inorganic chemicals..."

404
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,471
What?

405
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:35,874
Did you drink all of them?

406
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,576
We had 10 bottles.

407
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:38,977
Yes.

408
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,981
Hey, you're not the only one
who's trying to slim down.

409
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,685
Look at this. I only gained
a tiny bit of weight,

410
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,288
but my belly is sticking out already.
It's gross.

411
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,892
Let's become pretty together, okay?

412
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,395
I'll buy more.

413
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,197
Will you meet up with Kyung
Seok and go with him?

414
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:00,582
What?

415
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:04,198
I'm sure you will. You two
will be all lovey-dovey.

416
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:07,306
Look at this, okay? Lovey-dovey.

417
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,683
It's not funny at all.

418
00:30:08,783 --> 00:30:09,808
I'm having fun.

419
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,209
I'm not.

420
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,210
What's your problem?

421
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,984
(Messages)

422
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,683
I guess we're not going to
the lab together today.

423
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,316
How long have you been waiting?

424
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,500
For about 10 minutes?

425
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,735
You should've called me.

426
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:38,450
You were going to come out anyway.

427
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,840
Let's stop by somewhere.

428
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,941
Where?

429
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,582
You'll find out.

430
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,084
(Mask)

431
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,622
Are you buying a mask? Do you have a cold?

432
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,125
No, I want to cover my face.

433
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,442
Why do you want to cover your face?

434
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,228
Because you're worried
about people seeing us.

435
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,163
I'll just wear this.

436
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,466
It's too hot though.

437
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,337
Then I'll wear it.

438
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:14,130
No, I'll wear it.

439
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,808
No. It's because of me,
so I'll just wear it.

440
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,112
Then let's both wear it.

441
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,155
Are you all right?

442
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,790
Yes.

443
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,360
But I think we stand out more
now because of these masks.

444
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,997
I told you that I'd just wear it alone.

445
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:39,998
Take it off.

446
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,600
No, it's okay. You should take it off.

447
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,868
No, you take it off.

448
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,838
"Take it off"? People
may get the wrong idea.

449
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:51,640
You should take it off too. You'll
get heat rash on your chin.

450
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:55,142
We can tell people that we commute
together because we're neighbors.

451
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,151
As long as we don't hold
hands, we'll be fine.

452
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:19,638
By the way, where do you want to go after?

453
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,040
Shall we go somewhere far?

454
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,009
Somewhere far? Where?

455
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,311
Let's think about it.

456
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:31,624
Seriously.

457
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,318
But the thing is...

458
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:34,508
Hello.

459
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,721
Soo A must have something to do with it.

460
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:42,928
It looked like Tae Young was
confessing his feelings to her.

461
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,308
There was a gift in front of Soo A,

462
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,833
and the two of them looked all serious.

463
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:51,142
She must've rejected him.

464
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:56,543
Has Tae Young ever met up with
a girl one on one before this?

465
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,243
We all hung out together all the time.

466
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,729
All right. Let's just say...

467
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,115
...that Tae Young likes Soo A now.

468
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,017
But you two just broke up.

469
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,042
When do you think it all happened?

470
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,556
I bet something was already going
on when you two were together.

471
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,459
I knew it.

472
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:18,363
A few times, he was thinking about
something else and couldn't hear me.

473
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,566
He also kept texting someone
when we were together.

474
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,068
Right?

475
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,575
There's always a reason when guys
break up with you out of the blue.

476
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:55,000
You're early.

477
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,536
Yes.

478
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:05,944
Soo A.

479
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:10,315
Do you want to have lunch with me today?

480
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,616
I'll treat you.

481
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,158
Why?

482
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:17,225
I figured you'd still be
uncomfortable around Kyung Seok.

483
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,961
Thanks, Eun. You're the best.

484
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:34,072
Come in.

485
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:40,785
Woo Young.

486
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,725
Hey, Hyun Jung.

487
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,016
Are you busy?

488
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,619
No, I'm almost done. What brings you here?

489
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,121
Oh, I came to return some books.

490
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,925
Do you want to have coffee with me?

491
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,428
Sure, just a second.

492
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:03,191
You said someone confessed her
feelings for you. What happened?

493
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:05,203
She was so cool about it.

494
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,506
I'm not sure how she
actually took it though.

495
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:10,742
What about you? How do you feel?

496
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,526
I'm a little worried.

497
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,326
And I hope she'll quickly get over it.

498
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,518
I was asking about you, not her.

499
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,721
Me?

500
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:26,024
I know you liked Mi Rae.

501
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,726
Hey, how did you...

502
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,044
You knew that?

503
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,530
Of course. I'm a psychology major.

504
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,836
You know everything even
without experience and words.

505
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,308
Then...

506
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,093
You must also know that
I got rejected by her.

507
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:55,387
No, I didn't know that.

508
00:35:57,892 --> 00:35:58,790
What?

509
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,396
I guess best friends don't always
tell each other everything.

510
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:08,500
So you did ask her out.

511
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,137
Yes, of course.

512
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,807
I took my chances on that
one percent probability.

513
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:19,525
I figured I should ask her
out to not have any regrets.

514
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,014
I guess girls and guys are different.

515
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:25,116
I don't think I'd ever
confess my feelings...

516
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,126
...unless there was a 99 percent chance.

517
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,921
Why bother confess when you
know it won't work out?

518
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,226
I have a lot to learn from you.

519
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:50,659
I've never dated anyone.

520
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:57,348
Sorry.

521
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:03,644
I guess everyone's eating outside today.

522
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:05,549
Dong Won's the only person here.

523
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,660
Won Ho went outside with Sung Woon...

524
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,562
...because he's upset with Soo A.

525
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:13,865
Tae Hee and Ye Na left to
talk about some secret.

526
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,292
And Soo A left to eat with Eun.

527
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,774
He was starting to get friendly,
but he's eating alone again.

528
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,385
What are you doing? Sit down.

529
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,790
Why are you sitting next to me...

530
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:52,470
...instead of Mi Rae?

531
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,377
Kyung Seok doesn't always sit next to me.

532
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,792
There's a rumor saying
he always follows...

533
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,183
...his friend from middle school
because he lacks social skills.

534
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,086
I lack social skills?

535
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,588
Yes. Didn't you know?

536
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,392
You really do lack social skills.

537
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,731
He's funnier than you think
and speaks pretty eloquently.

538
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:20,899
Really?

539
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:25,737
Then do you know who he likes?

540
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,325
Not really.

541
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,310
Are you dating her right now?

542
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:38,693
- Yes.
- My gosh.

543
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:41,486
- Who is it?
- That's none of your business.

544
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:44,289
Why are you keeping it a secret?

545
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,992
Is it...

546
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,699
- ...a celebrity?
- No.

547
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:58,503
I can already tell that you're nervous.

548
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,004
I got it right, didn't I?

549
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,307
Didn't I?

550
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,911
Gosh, I wonder who it is. I'm so curious.

551
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,325
Why are you curious about whom I date?

552
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,317
Of course, I'm curious.

553
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:16,020
She was good enough for
you to reject Soo A.

554
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,792
Do you really not know?

555
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,425
What? No.

556
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:32,203
I wonder if I can transfer
schools even in college.

557
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,307
You really are funnier than I expected.

558
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:37,842
Are you going to transfer schools?

559
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,459
If only Soo A didn't tell
everyone that she likes me.

560
00:39:57,192 --> 00:39:59,426
It's all because of me.

561
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:02,193
It's because I care too much
about what other people think.

562
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:07,586
- I'm sorry.
- Don't feel sorry toward me.

563
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,807
That's what Soo A wants.

564
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:22,186
I'm not angry at you.

565
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:25,592
Kyung Seok.

566
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:29,328
What are you doing here?

567
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:40,904
Did I catch you guys?

568
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:52,717
My gosh, are you guys dating?

569
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,319
How cute.

570
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,523
Why aren't you saying anything?

571
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,325
Did I startle you that much?

572
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,427
So what if I know?

573
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:06,497
- Aren't you surprised?
- Of course, I'm surprised.

574
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:09,701
I'm so surprised right now.
I can't believe it.

575
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,092
To be honest, I always
wanted you to become...

576
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,406
...Kyung Seok's girlfriend, Mi Rae.

577
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:18,509
I can't believe things worked
out the way I wanted them to.

578
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,592
I came to take some rest,
but I guess I should leave.

579
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:26,985
I won't disturb you guys.

580
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:28,586
Have fun.

581
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,991
Bye.

582
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,895
- She's really cool about it.
- Seriously.

583
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:41,099
Is it because she lived
abroad for a long time?

584
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:47,905
- Are you okay?
- What? What do you mean?

585
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,459
The fact that she found out.

586
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,310
Yes.

587
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:56,814
I think I'm okay.

588
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:21,792
Do you have something to say to me?

589
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:26,193
Are you done eating?

590
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:27,945
Yes.

591
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:34,385
What is it?

592
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:39,590
To be honest, I saw you in my
neighborhood a couple days ago.

593
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,162
And I noticed Tae Young taking you home.

594
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,165
Oh, that?

595
00:42:48,158 --> 00:42:50,368
We coincidentally ran into each other,

596
00:42:50,459 --> 00:42:52,559
and he took me home
because it was too late.

597
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:55,373
I kept saying he didn't
have to, but he insisted.

598
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,177
Is there a problem with that?

599
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,547
Ye Na...

600
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,459
...apparently saw you with
Tae Young yesterday.

601
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,852
I think she thinks Tae Young...

602
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,321
...broke up with Tae Hee because of you.

603
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,422
I mean,

604
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,704
it's true that I met
up with him yesterday.

605
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:17,911
But I only met up with him to tell him...

606
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:21,833
...that he should try to work
things out with Tae Hee...

607
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,192
...because Tae Hee seemed to be
going through a hard time.

608
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:30,441
If you have something to say,
you can be honest and tell me.

609
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,118
To be honest,

610
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,621
I think I was always
misunderstood this way.

611
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:51,129
I guess it's not easy for me
to get along with other girls.

612
00:43:57,826 --> 00:44:00,638
I'm pretty sure she's from our school.

613
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,406
Could it be...

614
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,619
What were you doing that made you jump?

615
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,725
Nothing.

616
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,523
You punk.

617
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:21,326
You were watching something
nice, weren't you?

618
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,961
Gosh, give it back.

619
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,363
Let me see.

620
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:33,671
- Give it to me.
- Let me see.

621
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:41,279
(Comments)

622
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,948
Today's photo is too weak. Thanks though.

623
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:45,449
She has the physique of
an elementary school kid.

624
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,752
Hey, isn't this Soo A?

625
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:49,754
I don't know.

626
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:52,759
Gosh.

627
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,961
She must be a little out
of her mind these days.

628
00:44:57,258 --> 00:44:59,163
I heard she got rejected by Kyung Seok.

629
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,264
What?

630
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,267
She publicly confessed that she
likes him but got rejected.

631
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:04,468
Really?

632
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:10,241
We must've misunderstood her
until now because of her looks.

633
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:16,347
Should I call her out later
and make her feel better?

634
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:19,750
You should call her.

635
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,460
Don't say that I'm here.

636
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,155
It might be uncomfortable for her...

637
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:25,359
...since she and I flirted
with each other before.

638
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,892
Okay. I'll see you later.

639
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,759
Hey, just try it. Trying won't harm you.

640
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,160
You'll try calling her, right?

641
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,158
- Bye.
- Bye.

642
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:48,525
Kyung Hee.

643
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,850
Oh, hello.

644
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,952
Your dad wants to talk to you.

645
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:01,025
What is it? Make it quick.

646
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:07,732
Delete all the videos you posted online.

647
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,835
Those Lovely Do videos.

648
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,327
It's all over the internet, so I can't.

649
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:15,906
You can't?

650
00:46:16,025 --> 00:46:18,926
I may delete them on my account, but
I can't do anything with the rest.

651
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:20,993
You...

652
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:26,041
My slogan is the mayor
for ordinary people.

653
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,626
How could you show that
expensive bag on your stream?

654
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,759
I never asked you for it.

655
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:34,058
You gave it to me, and now, it's
my fault for getting caught?

656
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:39,063
Fine.

657
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,459
Isn't there any way?

658
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,969
No. I'll go, bye.

659
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,092
I guess we can only hold hands on the bus.

660
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,992
Where are we going by the way?

661
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,959
Somewhere far away.

662
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:10,692
Then you won't feel anxious.

663
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:19,907
Hey.

664
00:47:19,991 --> 00:47:21,558
Can't you use the other hand?

665
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,859
Hello?

666
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:35,559
Yes, I'm on my way to somewhere
after school. What is it?

667
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:38,543
Is that right? Okay.

668
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:41,226
Be careful. Bye.

669
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:44,759
- Was it Hyun Jung?
- Yes.

670
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:47,775
She's going to her parents' house.

671
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:49,767
When is she coming back?

672
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,526
Tomorrow.

673
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:08,319
If you're...

674
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,152
...uncomfortable being outside...

675
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,426
I mean, you're always anxious.

676
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:26,103
Do you want to...

677
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:28,472
...go to my house?

678
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:31,175
Well...

679
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:33,893
That's not a bad idea.

680
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,526
Okay.

681
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:38,592
Let's go then.

682
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:55,857
If you have something to say,
you can be honest and tell me.

683
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,790
Hello?

684
00:49:08,848 --> 00:49:11,182
Oh, hello.

685
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:12,283
Hey.

686
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:14,885
You weren't expecting to
get a call from me, right?

687
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:20,491
I had no idea I'd end
up calling you either.

688
00:49:20,592 --> 00:49:22,992
But I saw something strange,

689
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,196
so I thought I should tell you.

690
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:27,995
What is it?

691
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,668
Let's meet up if you have time.

692
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:32,191
Now?

693
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,905
We can do it later if
you're busy right now.

694
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:37,428
I just thought you should
know as soon as possible.

695
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,587
Hold on.

696
00:49:49,926 --> 00:49:51,522
I'll stop by somewhere.

697
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,991
- Where?
- Wait inside.

698
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,808
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

699
00:49:56,892 --> 00:49:57,795
Okay.

700
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:06,403
- You're home.
- Goodness.

701
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:08,205
Why are you so surprised?

702
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:09,425
Well...

703
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,209
What brings you here all of a sudden?

704
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:14,211
Mom missed you so much.

705
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,648
Come on. You're the one
who wanted to come.

706
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:24,822
Everything...

707
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:26,924
...is fine, right?

708
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,793
Of course.

709
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:32,997
How's the relationship with your friends?

710
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,199
What are you talking about?

711
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,692
I mean...

712
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:39,503
We're wondering if you're doing
great with your college friends...

713
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,393
...and if you have a boyfriend.

714
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:49,725
How many candles would you like?

715
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,016
Just one big candle is fine.

716
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,325
Okay.

717
00:51:06,652 --> 00:51:07,952
This is alcohol-free, right?

718
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:09,733
Right.

719
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,675
Are these for sale too?

720
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,077
No, those are just for decoration.

721
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:21,779
Can't you sell these?

722
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:22,780
Pardon?

723
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,559
I don't think there will
be glasses for wine.

724
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,093
I guess you're going over
to your girlfriend's house.

725
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:30,688
Yes.

726
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,090
I'll make it an exception then.

727
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,592
Just pay for the glasses.

728
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,594
Thank you.

729
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,992
(Mi Rae)

730
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:51,809
My parents are here.

731
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:54,011
I'll call you back. I'm sorry.

732
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:04,521
You should've come with
Hyun Jung to see us.

733
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,323
Why would you stay here alone?

734
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,126
I have a lot of stuff to do.

735
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,395
You have a lot of things
to do in the summer break?

736
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:13,592
This and that.

737
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:18,669
There are a lot to do about
the lab field study.

738
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,270
Do they give you homework too?

739
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:24,658
Yes, so you should leave for today.

740
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,359
You said you didn't have dinner yet.
Let's eat dinner together.

741
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:33,150
Now that I think of it, I ate
with my friends on the way here.

742
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,452
No wonder why I felt full.

743
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:36,453
Your friends, who?

744
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,323
What do you mean? My college friends.

745
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:42,126
Your college friends, who?
Whom are you close with?

746
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,928
You wouldn't know even if
I told you their names.

747
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:46,830
I wouldn't...

748
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:49,433
...except for the boy named Do Kyung Seok.

749
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,003
It's because I'm curious to know...

750
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,606
...who are on my daughter's side.

751
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:59,810
- My side?
- Stop the nonsense.

752
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,625
When will you visit our house?

753
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,214
Well, I'll visit soon...

754
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,427
...when I'm done with the field study.

755
00:53:07,592 --> 00:53:11,026
So you should go for today.

756
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,123
Why do you keep trying to kick us out?

757
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,025
I came here because I missed you.

758
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,693
What do you mean, I tried to kick you out?

759
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:22,099
It's just that I don't want Dad to
struggle from driving at night.

760
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,968
Driving is not hard. I can
do it with my eyes closed.

761
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:28,505
You can't do that. How ridiculous.

762
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:30,708
I'm just saying.

763
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:33,510
No one can drive with their eyes closed.
How ridiculous.

764
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,113
It's frightening just to think about it.

765
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:39,416
You always have to be careful in
driving even if you're used to it.

766
00:53:39,525 --> 00:53:42,619
Gosh, I'm aware of it more than you are.

767
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,026
It's done.

768
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,024
Do you need anything else to be fixed?

769
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:48,425
No.

770
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,124
Hey.

771
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,437
You're here. Have a seat.

772
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,844
Well, do you want a beer?

773
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:09,947
Sure.

774
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,050
- We'll get two pints of beer.
- Sure.

775
00:54:13,826 --> 00:54:16,160
What did you want to talk to me about?

776
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:22,158
It might be because I'm overly sensitive,

777
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,959
but actually...

778
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,864
Jo Jung Yeob!

779
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,869
- Gosh, what's he doing here?
- Hi, Soo A.

780
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,371
Gosh, you're such a backstabber.

781
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,743
Chan Woo, I have to talk
to Soo A about something.

782
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,645
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

783
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,347
- A pint of beer, please.
- Sure.

784
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:44,648
Chan Woo.

785
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:47,370
Soo A, you must be stressed out.

786
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,053
But you know what?

787
00:54:49,138 --> 00:54:51,275
Kyung Seok is handsome,
but that's about it.

788
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,056
He'll drive you crazy.

789
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:54,958
I think you're way too good for him.

790
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,361
Let's talk outside.

791
00:54:57,459 --> 00:54:58,562
What's your problem?

792
00:54:58,662 --> 00:54:59,863
Just come with me.

793
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,766
What is this about? Soo
A, I'll be right back.

794
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,737
- Let go!
- Just come with me.

795
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:09,640
- Let go of me!
- Come on, let's talk.

796
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:11,742
- What is your problem?
- Gosh, seriously.

797
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,710
- Leave, please.
- What?

798
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,312
Didn't you see the look on Soo A's face?

799
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,614
You make her uncomfortable.

800
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:22,219
Hey, do you think you'll have
a chance with her if I leave?

801
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,721
I have more of a chance than you do.

802
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,426
Let's be honest. Since the mop incident,

803
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,126
no girl at our school has
been talking to you.

804
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,459
What?

805
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,396
Don't meddle in and cause a scene.
Just leave.

806
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,399
- Leave already. Gosh.
- That little...

807
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:36,500
Hey!

808
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:51,582
(What's that photo? Is it Hyun Soo A?)

809
00:56:25,645 --> 00:56:26,950
Soo A, that was awkward, right?

810
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,152
I should've asked him to
leave right off the bat.

811
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:30,787
Gosh, what a nuisance.

812
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,656
What are these?

813
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:42,633
That's actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

814
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,726
I happened to see them
while surfing the web.

815
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:47,838
By any chance,

816
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,874
is that you?

817
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,059
- No.
- It's not you?

818
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:57,558
No, it's not me.

819
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,884
Many girls in similar clothes would
look like me from this angle.

820
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:03,659
Well, that is true.

821
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:07,457
I'm just a little worried
about you, that's all.

822
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:10,460
Hey, come out for a minute.

823
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,996
My gosh, what is the matter with you?

824
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:14,698
I was just going to leave quietly,

825
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,100
but I can't because of your rude tone.

826
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,102
- Come out.
- What is your problem?

827
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,805
Soo A. Hey, wait. Soo A!

828
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,107
You made her leave!

829
00:57:24,225 --> 00:57:26,892
Soo A, you don't have to date me.
Just don't date this jerk.

830
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:28,712
- What? You piece of...
- Gosh.

831
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:30,193
- What did you say?
- Gosh, let go.

832
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,782
You jerk.

833
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:33,784
Hey. Hey, you little...

834
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,886
- Gosh, let go.
- You'd better let go.

835
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:36,987
You let go first.

836
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,194
Who could it be? Who took the photos?

837
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,996
What is this about?

838
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,198
Who on earth did such a thing?

839
00:58:08,564 --> 00:58:11,188
They left. I'm sorry.

840
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,644
Yes, I'm coming.

841
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:55,999
I'm sorry.

842
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,459
What's that?

843
00:59:01,258 --> 00:59:02,672
I got you something.

844
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,793
Thank goodness you didn't bring a TV.

845
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,493
This is how Hyun Jung and I live.

846
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:22,492
I know. I carried you home a
little while ago, remember?

847
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,397
I laid you down on your bed.

848
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,826
Why don't you have a seat?

849
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,626
Oh, no. Not there.

850
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:44,815
Sit over there.

851
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,326
Did you make this?

852
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,698
Yes.

853
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,301
- At home?
- Yes.

854
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:12,775
- Aren't you hungry?
- A little.

855
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,077
Shall we order some food?

856
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,680
Jjajangmyeon would get here the quickest.

857
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:18,277
Let's eat whatever you have.

858
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,683
Whatever we have here?

859
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,986
- We can order if you have nothing.
- Oh, well...

860
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,857
I do have some side
dishes that my mom made.

861
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,259
This is just a feeling I'm getting,

862
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,364
but I think Mi Rae is
hiding something from us.

863
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,966
She's done it before, you know.

864
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:39,069
Even when something happened
at school, she never told us.

865
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,671
We only found out later
on through her teacher.

866
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,241
If her teacher knew that much,

867
01:00:44,325 --> 01:00:46,243
I bet there were many other
things that happened.

868
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:49,125
Don't be so negative.

869
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,148
That only happened because
they were too young.

870
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:53,550
I'm sure there's no bullying at colleges.

871
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,453
I just think it's strange that she
kept trying to make us leave.

872
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,357
I wonder if she did that to
hide her stress from me.

873
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:03,259
We should've stayed longer.

874
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:05,729
Or we should've just brought her with us.

875
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,030
Shall we turn back?

876
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:10,233
Forget it.

877
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:13,093
Maybe she just wanted some alone time.

878
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,993
Let's just go home.

879
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:22,325
- Is it good?
- Yes.

880
01:01:23,826 --> 01:01:25,893
Eat up. There's more food.

881
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,319
Your mom made these for you though.

882
01:01:29,425 --> 01:01:30,825
I can't eat them all.

883
01:01:30,926 --> 01:01:33,623
It's okay. You can eat them all.

884
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,326
This is the first time...

885
01:01:40,725 --> 01:01:43,559
...we're eating together since
we started dating, right?

886
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,659
Yes, I think it is.

887
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,342
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying that.

888
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,258
Sorry...

889
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,025
What should we do when we're done eating?

890
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,652
Shall we watch a movie?

891
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,824
It'll take a couple of
hours to finish a movie.

892
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,328
Then we can do whatever you want to do.
I don't care.

893
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,693
I can't really think of anything.

894
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,702
Do you want to try
making a scented candle?

895
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:20,203
I'll teach you.

896
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,425
Sure.

897
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,752
Stir this. I'll mix the scents.

898
01:02:36,258 --> 01:02:37,187
Okay.

899
01:02:44,772 --> 01:02:45,795
Like this?

900
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:47,998
Yes.

901
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,208
By the way,

902
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,011
when did you start liking me?

903
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:14,224
When I found out that you
never laughed at me.

904
01:03:18,225 --> 01:03:19,525
So it's been a while.

905
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,235
What about you?

906
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:30,026
- Maybe at the frosh week event.
- The frosh week event?

907
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,577
When I was dancing?

908
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,379
No.

909
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:40,992
When Kim Chan Woo was
giving you a hard time.

910
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,586
It made me so angry.

911
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,665
All the pieces have to melt evenly.
Keep stirring.

912
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:00,170
Hey.

913
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:03,139
I'm fine.

914
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,843
You're obviously not fine. Come here.

915
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:17,854
Are you dumb?

916
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:21,958
You should've been careful.
Why did you touch it?

917
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:24,561
It wasn't that hot.

918
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,193
Still, you have to cool it down
under cold water for a long time.

919
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:29,758
Burns are so painful.

920
01:04:37,592 --> 01:04:39,193
Do we have ice cubes?

921
01:05:08,528 --> 01:05:09,939
You're wearing that perfume.

922
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:16,146
I used to hate this scent so much.

923
01:05:19,525 --> 01:05:20,825
But I like it now.

924
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:09,599
