1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:03,009
Take it easy. Have a good day.

2
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:06,612
Take it easy.

3
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,180
Take it easy.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,500
Why did they send you of all people?

5
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,005
- A little higher.
- Is this good?

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,106
Pull it up a little higher.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,600
(Fun Times with Chemistry)

8
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,817
This is the department of chemistry.

9
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,588
This is the department of chemistry.
Come visit us!

10
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,990
Come visit us!

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,734
We've prepared many fun things.

12
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,784
Everyone, come visit us!

13
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:28,729
We'll have food too.

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,601
Hey, what's taking the girls so long?

15
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:34,234
- They're getting changed.
- Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

16
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,343
I wish I was born as a pretty girl
so that I could take orders only.

17
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,335
That's the uniform?

18
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,422
- I don't like it.
- Me neither.

19
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,611
You said you picked the design with them.

20
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:05,147
Well, Jung Yeob and Jung Ho...

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,550
...said this design is nice, so
I just went along with it.

22
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:10,837
The skirt looked a bit
longer on the photo.

23
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,942
What do you think? Will you
be okay in this uniform?

24
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:18,332
I'm a bit...

25
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,446
You don't like it?

26
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,334
Let's not wear this if
Mi Rae doesn't want to.

27
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,651
Why are you putting it on me?

28
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,667
Are we allowed to not wear this uniform?

29
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,769
What are you doing?
We'll have customers soon.

30
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,116
Our bar will be packed.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
You girls look exactly as how I imagined.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,862
None of us imagined this.

33
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,966
Is it a bit too short?

34
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,367
What are you talking about?
I've seen many girls in skirts like this.

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,347
What should we do?

36
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:47,228
Come on, you all look great in it.

37
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:48,397
Girls, stand right there.

38
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,413
I'll take a nice photo of you
to remember this moment.

39
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,815
- Strike a pose.
- We'll have customers...

40
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,517
Come on, hurry up. Strike a pose.

41
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,750
All right, 1, 2. Smile, please.

42
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,141
1, 2.

43
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:01,827
You all look gorgeous.
All right, one more time.

44
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,435
1, 2.

45
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,670
Oh, the chemistry department?
I'll definitely come by.

46
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,302
I wonder which bar has the hottest guys.

47
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,732
We'd like a pancake and a
serving of assorted skewers.

48
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:15,341
- A pancake and assorted skewers?
- Yes.

49
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,938
- Sure, no problem.
- We need some water here.

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,928
Sure. Just a moment, please.

51
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,753
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, we're good.

52
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,968
- Okay. Your food will be out soon.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,658
- Excuse me. We'd like a pancake.
- Oh, my.

54
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,683
- She's so pretty.
- Sure, I'll bring it over shortly.

55
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,966
Hey, we already ordered a
pancake just a minute ago.

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,449
- Gosh, another pancake.
- To tell you the truth...

57
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:37,346
I was going to tell you. Gosh.

58
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:39,947
- Actually, this was the reason.
- Gosh, seriously.

59
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,282
- Because of this?
- You always...

60
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,865
It looks like Jung Boon
has many guy friends.

61
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:47,268
She knows a lot of people.

62
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,558
I heard she knows
everyone from her school.

63
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,801
- Oh, boy.
- Why do you even live?

64
00:02:55,776 --> 00:03:00,480
I've never had a guy friend in my life.

65
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,885
Excuse me, where can we sit?

66
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,286
Oh, this way...

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,208
Hey, Kang Orc.

68
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,701
I'm calling you, Kang Orc.

69
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,794
You don't even know your nickname?

70
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,241
You're lying, right?

71
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,118
Tell me that it's a lie. Right now.

72
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,316
- Yong Chul.
- Kang Orc.

73
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,707
I'll kill you if you tell people
that you have a crush on me.

74
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,408
You'd better not tell anyone.

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,567
I didn't think...

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,281
...I'd see him ever again.

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,256
- Hey, you made it.
- Yes, hi.

78
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,093
- Is he your friend?
- Yes, my new friend.

79
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,001
We met through social media.

80
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:53,354
This is the pretty friend I mentioned.
You saw her in my photo.

81
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,237
These are Park Yong Chul and his friends.

82
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,172
These are Kang Mi Rae and Lee Ji Hyo.

83
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,241
Hi, nice to meet you.

84
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,168
It's nice to meet you guys.
I should get back to work.

85
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,848
Kang Mi Rae?

86
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,250
What's wrong?

87
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,452
I know someone with the same name.

88
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,721
Really? A friend of yours?

89
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,223
My middle school alumna.

90
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,134
- Have a seat here.
- Let's sit.

91
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,024
All right.

92
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:41,333
Did you call the police?

93
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,417
I did, as I was firing her.

94
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:46,201
I feel so bad for the way I treated
Jung Boon. What should I do?

95
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,416
You should apologize to her.

96
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,982
What I'm saying is, I feel so bad
that I can't even apologize.

97
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,160
Then apologize and tell her
how terrible you feel.

98
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,867
Let's go.

99
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,600
Go where?

100
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,866
My department's bar.
Jung Boon should be there.

101
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,270
Will you be with me when
I apologize to her?

102
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,672
- Are you a kid?
- Gosh.

103
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,775
What are you doing? Let's go.

104
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,878
So which school do you go to?

105
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,682
I'm studying psychology
at Hankook University.

106
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,489
The psychology department
at Hankook University?

107
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,420
Your grades must've been very high.

108
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,067
Gosh, no.

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,584
By the way, why didn't you choose
the department of practical music?

110
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,867
I'm a huge fan of Tiger JK.

111
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,482
I saw him on a TV show a while back,

112
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,382
and he said he recommends choosing...

113
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,177
...something else for your major
if you want to become a rapper.

114
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,399
- Hey.
- Hey, Tiger JK.

115
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,590
What's up, man?

116
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,566
- Hello.
- What's up?

117
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,139
Hey, man. How are you doing?

118
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,753
Tiger JK, she's a huge fan of yours.

119
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,355
- Hello.
- Hello.

120
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,356
Hey, peace. Peace.

121
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,823
She's a university student,
but she wants to be a rapper.

122
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,825
I asked her to come by to
show us what she can do.

123
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,750
Okay, then could you show us?
Don't be nervous.

124
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,129
Sure.

125
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,332
- Do it.
- Do it.

126
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,636
Are you ready?

127
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,638
- Yes.
- I'll drop the beat.

128
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,840
Okay.

129
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,643
♪ I wear mismatching shoes

130
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,441
♪ And I start running backwards

131
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,477
♪ People tell me I'm imperfect

132
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:31,678
♪ But no, I'm perfect

133
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:34,661
♪ I have my own way of survival

134
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,865
♪ A life that's lacking is imperfect

135
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,269
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,885
It's okay. Don't feel discouraged.
Let's hear it one more time.

137
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:48,592
Okay, I'm sorry.
I should've practiced a bit more.

138
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:49,909
I'll try one more time.

139
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:52,178
- One more time. Let's go.
- Let's go.

140
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,371
Here's the beat.

141
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:11,017
Oh, come on.

142
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,144
Jung Boon, can we talk for a minute?

143
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:22,753
Do you know him?

144
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:24,452
- Who is he?
- Who is he?

145
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,538
- Is there something wrong?
- No, it's nothing.

146
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,022
No, I'll be right back.

147
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,227
- Don't take too long.
- See you later.

148
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:29,340
Excuse me.

149
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:30,552
Let's drink.

150
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:32,538
- Cheers.
- He's out of alcohol.

151
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,386
Pour him a drink.

152
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,068
You're better-looking.

153
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,878
Tae Young, I have something to tell you.

154
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,597
- What is it?
- I'm not feeling so well.

155
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,900
Can I take a short break?

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,601
Do you feel sick?

157
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,219
I'm just a little tired.

158
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,703
Oh, really?

159
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,208
If you leave, someone will
have to take your place.

160
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,511
I'll do it.

161
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:05,275
Kyung Seok? I thought you
didn't want to wait tables.

162
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,968
I'll take your place.

163
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,643
I thought you wouldn't come, but
I guess you're loyal after all.

164
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:17,163
Kyung Seok said he wasn't
going to come, but he did.

165
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,728
You said you didn't want to wait tables.

166
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,920
Are you here as a customer?

167
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,219
No, I'm here to wait tables.

168
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,804
I'm glad you're here.

169
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:27,870
How nice of you.

170
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,403
- Let's go.
- It smells here.

171
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,697
- What's in here?
- Are there green onions in here?

172
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:40,787
Green onions?

173
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:44,703
What if Yong Chul recognizes Kyung Seok?

174
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:51,798
Is he in your major?

175
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,200
Who? Kyung Seok?

176
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,602
He used to go to my middle school.

177
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:56,903
Really?

178
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,105
That means you went to the
same school as Mi Rae as well.

179
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,508
Oh, she's talking about the
pretty girl you saw earlier.

180
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:04,310
Mi Rae and Kyung Seok are
from the same middle school.

181
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,192
Do you feel sick?

182
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,914
No, I'm just tired.

183
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,501
Thank you. I'm going to go take some rest.

184
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:30,003
Mi Rae.

185
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,205
Just a second.

186
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,607
What? Why?

187
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,609
Kyung Seok.

188
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:40,280
Can you help me carry this? It's so heavy.

189
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,882
Hey, I'll carry it for you.
You should've asked me for help.

190
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,369
Kyung Seok.

191
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,389
Hello. Do you need anything?

192
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:51,858
Since when were you
friends with Jung Boon?

193
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,569
He's so manly.

194
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:02,001
Mi Rae, Yong Chul apparently
went to the same school as you.

195
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,809
Are you Kang Mi Rae from
Jaryong Middle School?

196
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,914
Yes.

197
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,203
I'm Park Yong Chul.
You remember me, right?

198
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,719
Yes.

199
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,419
So you guys do know each other.

200
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:24,004
This is so cool.

201
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,719
What a joke.

202
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:28,828
Why?

203
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,930
What? No, it's nothing.

204
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,491
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,805
You took that thief's side
and treated me like a liar.

206
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:43,985
To be honest, I don't
really know you that well.

207
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,784
Then how well did you know her?

208
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,681
I'm really naive, so I'm not good
at making the right judgments.

209
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,806
I couldn't see what a brat she was.
Meanwhile, you're so nice and...

210
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,319
Gosh, I'm such a stupid jerk.

211
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,893
I'm the one to blame.
I shouldn't have done that.

212
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,029
You just laughed, didn't you?

213
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:06,836
I think I saw you laugh.

214
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:12,906
Thank you so much.

215
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,908
And I'm sorry.

216
00:11:15,436 --> 00:11:17,519
People can make mistakes.

217
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:19,119
Does that mean you forgive me?

218
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:21,614
Well, you keep apologizing,

219
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,404
so I should forgive you.

220
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:27,687
My gosh, I seriously had
trouble breathing earlier.

221
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,903
I can finally breathe now.

222
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,603
Thank you.

223
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,402
And I'm sorry.

224
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,452
You guys must be really
glad to see each other.

225
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:56,149
What a small world.

226
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,770
I should've been nicer to you if
I knew you'd become so pretty.

227
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,004
My gosh.

228
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,023
Are you guys not going to wait tables?

229
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,026
Just give us a minute.
They're from the same school.

230
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:10,637
That's so cool. How amazing.

231
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:14,334
I hope you guys all have a great time.

232
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,638
I hope you guys have fun.

233
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,641
Do you still hate me?

234
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,344
Kyung Seok.

235
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,447
I heard he went to the
same middle school as you.

236
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:32,318
Did you do something wrong?

237
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:35,907
I can already guess what happened.
He must've liked her one-sidedly.

238
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:39,225
It was actually the opposite.
She's the one that liked me.

239
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,219
Have you gone mad?

240
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,431
I'm serious. She even told
me that she liked me.

241
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:46,733
Didn't you?

242
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,055
You should go now.

243
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,642
How can you tell me to leave?
I'm a customer.

244
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:55,608
Just leave.

245
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,810
What's wrong? I'm really glad to meet...

246
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,014
- Kang Orc again.
- Hey.

247
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:03,316
- She's the orc?
- She's the orc?

248
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,800
She's the orc I told you about.

249
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:12,191
Hey!

250
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,402
Follow me.

251
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:26,005
I just wanted to talk about the
good old days. Are you upset?

252
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,044
- Yong Chul.
- I said, follow me.

253
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,813
How scary. Hey, Mi Rae.

254
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,916
Do you think you're all that
now that you've become pretty?

255
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:44,123
Yes.

256
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,703
After I changed, I could finally see...

257
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,931
...that people like you
were worthless jerks.

258
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,333
What?

259
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,002
You didn't change at all.

260
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:02,503
You look down on people
based on their looks...

261
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,310
...and harass them.

262
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,816
You better remember this every time
you remember the name "Kang Orc".

263
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,618
To me, you were just...

264
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,854
...a piece of trash.

265
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,523
What did you say?

266
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,367
Hey, you totally ruined the mood.

267
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,744
Hey, wait.

268
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,680
Hey, scumbag.

269
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,785
- What?
- Scumbag.

270
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,956
Pay for your food.

271
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,237
Goodness.

272
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,030
Soo A, I'll call you again later.

273
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,514
How could you do that to your old friend?

274
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,657
It was a failure.

275
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,560
What's wrong with your voice by the way?

276
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,729
What?

277
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:32,904
Who? Park Yong Chul?

278
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,813
Why did he come all of a sudden?

279
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:39,739
How many surgeries did she do that
he didn't even recognize her?

280
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,741
Didn't Kyung Seok recognize her?

281
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,319
No, come to think,

282
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,345
Kyung Seok didn't recognize
her at first either.

283
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,549
So nothing on her face is original?

284
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,937
Her face must've changed because
she got plastic surgeries.

285
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,270
Did Mi Rae not recognize Yong Chul either?

286
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:58,270
Or did she act like she didn't know?

287
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,436
Anyway, it's the worst
nickname I've ever heard of.

288
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,503
How could he call her that?

289
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,404
She's the orc I told you about.

290
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,344
Do you think you're all that
now that you've become pretty?

291
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,530
My face may change,

292
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:22,352
but my past never changes.

293
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:23,649
Mi Rae.

294
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,237
I shouldn't have invited
the people I barely knew.

295
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,637
They came to see me at the cafe I work at,

296
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,670
so I only told them to come
visit during the festival.

297
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,011
I didn't know he was such a jerk.

298
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:54,486
Sorry.

299
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,003
It's not your fault.

300
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:59,350
No, I'm really sorry.

301
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,979
This wouldn't have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

302
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:07,527
It's okay. Don't mind it.

303
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,829
I want to mind it.

304
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,833
I want to be better to you.

305
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,536
You see,

306
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:23,221
I actually had a prejudice...

307
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,311
...about plastic surgeries.

308
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:30,607
I wondered if they wanted to become
prettier than others that much.

309
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,318
I thought it was too phony.

310
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,907
But I realized...

311
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,937
...that some people could
be desperate for it.

312
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,832
That some people might be in
pain because of their faces.

313
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,232
Do you think you can go
back and wait the tables?

314
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:58,712
I'll tell Tae Young if
you think you can't.

315
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,119
I can't see Soo A anymore
because of you, punk.

316
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,325
Why can't we?

317
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:14,918
We can see her without him.

318
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,102
Guys, where's your loyalty?

319
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,503
Hey, Park Yong Chul.

320
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,753
You remember me?

321
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,844
I'm Oh Hyun Jung, Mi Rae's friend.

322
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:29,575
So what?

323
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:33,475
I just can't understand
why you showed up here.

324
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,486
You bullied her enough in
middle school already.

325
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,876
I had no idea.

326
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,772
I only came because Soo A invited me.

327
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,999
Why would she invite
someone like you here?

328
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,284
Hey, she asked me to be friends first.

329
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,694
She visited my Instagram account
and liked my pictures first.

330
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,386
You saw it too, right?

331
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,597
Hold on.

332
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,002
See?

333
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,206
(Comments)

334
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,419
So she left?

335
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:13,004
I told her to go and
that I'd explain to you.

336
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,021
It can't be helped then.

337
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,119
But I have to go work part-time now too.

338
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:19,091
Really?

339
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,310
Can you walk around the school to
promote our bar before you go?

340
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,398
Okay, thank you.

341
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,885
- Thanks.
- Tae Young.

342
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,486
I think I have to go too.

343
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,270
Who's going to wait the tables then?

344
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,285
I mean, think about it.

345
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,374
Waiting the tables should
be done by the girls.

346
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,279
Park Yong Chul, that guy, is really weird.

347
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,803
How could he say such a thing
to a friend from middle school?

348
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,584
It's upsetting.

349
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,887
(Come visit the chemistry department bar.)

350
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,622
You brought him here.

351
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,937
I didn't know he'd be like that.

352
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,603
Who on earth came up with that nickname?

353
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:00,970
How could they do that to a girl?

354
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:04,755
She wouldn't have been
that ugly, you know.

355
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,540
She was cute.

356
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:14,637
Mi Rae was cute.

357
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:31,745
I actually had a prejudice...

358
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,823
...about plastic surgeries.

359
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:36,736
But I realized...

360
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,606
...that some people could
be desperate for it.

361
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,110
That some people might be in
pain because of their faces.

362
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:54,153
(Ms. Na Hye Sung)

363
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,839
Hello, ma'am.

364
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:03,260
I got the candles.

365
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:05,330
My employees said...

366
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,515
...its scent was amazing.

367
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,070
By any chance,
what are you doing right now?

368
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,772
I have time right now.

369
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,041
No, not in front of the school.

370
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:18,377
I'll go to your company.

371
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,085
Good. Then I'll go to your house.

372
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,088
Okay.

373
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:42,935
- Did Ye Na leave?
- She left for her appointment.

374
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:45,586
The okay-looking girl left.

375
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:48,002
Make the boys do the job
if you're short on labor.

376
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,380
Girls should wait the tables.

377
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:50,918
No one will come if guys are the servers.

378
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:52,486
This number of people
should be good enough.

379
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,603
It's almost over too.

380
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:57,005
Not every girl can be considered
woman just because of their gender.

381
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:58,319
It would've been so nice...

382
00:21:58,403 --> 00:22:00,686
...if you guys prepared for a situation
like this by doing as I said.

383
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,890
Even if we put the uniform aside,
your looks aren't qualified.

384
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,686
What did you just say?

385
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,918
You first have to grow your hair
to look like a girl, Yoon Byul.

386
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:13,032
Didn't I tell you to lose weight?

387
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,219
And you should smile a bit.

388
00:22:14,303 --> 00:22:16,702
Girls should be equipped
with amiable smiles.

389
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,520
Who are you to order me around?

390
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,204
Don't talk back, freshman.

391
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:23,781
I quit.

392
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:25,470
Make food like you've been doing.

393
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:26,683
I won't do that either.

394
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:28,314
I won't do anything, so don't look for me.

395
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,715
Where are you going?

396
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,915
Why do I have to do this even after
hearing such ridiculous gibberish?

397
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,423
I can't take your stupid remarks anymore.

398
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:39,625
Do you think we never criticize
you because we can't?

399
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,428
I simply didn't want to
stoop as low as you.

400
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,030
- Ugly punks.
- What?

401
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:46,915
- Let's go.
- Guys.

402
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:50,102
- What's wrong?
- They've suddenly become sensitive.

403
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,197
They're getting mad at our jokes.

404
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:54,431
Did we ever tell you that you're ugly?

405
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:56,375
I only gave you suggestions,
so what's wrong with that?

406
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,781
Stop it already. We don't want
to hear your suggestions.

407
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,282
What's with you, Tae Hee?

408
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,984
What does it mean that I'll
look pretty when I lose weight?

409
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,386
Are you saying that I'm a loser this way?

410
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,963
You tell us to do plastic
surgeries, grow hair,

411
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,689
change fashion style, and lose weight.

412
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:12,596
Should we get back at
you just the same way?

413
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,993
I know you'll make all the fuss then.

414
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,096
Tae Hee, how could you twist
his good intention like that?

415
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,198
He only meant your face
looks cute and pretty.

416
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,497
I don't even want to hear that.

417
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:22,167
I didn't ask you to say that I'm pretty.

418
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,264
You think we're products
displayed in a showroom?

419
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:26,381
You judge us by our looks.

420
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,174
Keep such thoughts to yourselves.

421
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,081
How dare you say that bluntly to us?

422
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,181
I'm out too.

423
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:36,282
I told you to stay put, freshman.

424
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:39,397
Does being a freshman mean,
I have to do everything I'm told?

425
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:41,587
Who are you to order us around?

426
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,289
Let's stop and go.

427
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,992
Hey. Goodness.

428
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,881
Hey.

429
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,864
I told them out of concern,

430
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,861
and how could they behave
this way to their senior?

431
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:56,869
- Stop it.
- Think about their attitude.

432
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:58,349
That's enough.

433
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,347
Where are you going?

434
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,510
I'm sorry.

435
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:19,559
I should've scolded them for
their rude behavior earlier.

436
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:23,164
I let it slide because things
were hectic with the festival.

437
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:25,748
Sorry.

438
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:31,265
Please don't be upset.

439
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,539
You know what's more irritating?

440
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,977
I keep trying to fit myself in
their standards unconsciously.

441
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:41,181
I always tell myself to lose weight.

442
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,882
You don't need to lose any weight.

443
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:45,666
They're doing that because they
like seeing you all riled up.

444
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,475
Seeing you flustered amuses them.

445
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:52,114
Besides, I don't like
girls who are too skinny.

446
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,592
There are many men who are like me.

447
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:59,311
Guys like me find cute, chubby
girls like you attractive.

448
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:07,616
Well, I'm not just talking about looks.

449
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,982
The way you talk and do things too.
You're cute in many ways...

450
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:13,915
Anyway, you don't need to change.

451
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:16,616
So don't let it stress you out.

452
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:22,823
Do you feel better now?

453
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:24,923
I'll be off, then.

454
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,098
Where are you?

455
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:11,997
I've always wanted to sit
here and eat ice cream,

456
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,487
but doing that alone would
look a bit weird, you know.

457
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,194
I mean, this isn't coffee.

458
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,646
Right.

459
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:23,336
The favor I asked you
must've stressed you out.

460
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:25,317
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,549
No, it's okay.

462
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,030
I really wanted to do it for you,

463
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:32,748
but I don't think I can
persuade Kyung Seok.

464
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:35,747
Is everything well with him?

465
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:39,765
Yes, I think so.

466
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,468
Are you two close?

467
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:44,949
Yes, I guess...

468
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,948
...we are pretty close.

469
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,164
We went to the same middle school too.

470
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:50,476
Really?

471
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:54,549
Which one? He transferred schools
during his middle school years.

472
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,349
Jaryong Middle School.

473
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:01,348
Then the two of you have
known each other since then.

474
00:27:03,448 --> 00:27:05,757
We did know of each other,

475
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:08,147
but we weren't close back then.

476
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:14,096
How was he in middle school?

477
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,214
He was very popular.

478
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:18,003
Was he?

479
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:21,015
He's very handsome, you know.

480
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:25,015
I guess I'm not the only
person who thinks that.

481
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:29,240
I saw him once from afar...

482
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,816
...back when he was in middle school.

483
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:33,619
Only once...

484
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,488
...for a brief moment.

485
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,382
I could see how much he had grown.

486
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,527
And he's all grown up now.

487
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:50,581
I actually met you when
I was in middle school.

488
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:52,971
Me?

489
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:54,873
Yes.

490
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,275
When?

491
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:00,115
You may not remember it though.

492
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:07,082
Even if you remember me from that
day, you won't recognize my face.

493
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:13,253
I had plastic surgery.

494
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,149
I got everything done.

495
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:21,516
By the way, where did we meet?

496
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:26,247
That day, I was so upset.

497
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:33,009
To tell you the truth, I had
a tough time growing up...

498
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,316
...because of my face.

499
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,785
Even I thought...

500
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:43,215
...that no one could be uglier than me.

501
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:47,059
Even I thought that I
looked like a monster.

502
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:17,489
Hey.

503
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,115
Are you stressed out about something?

504
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,361
My classmates...

505
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,664
...say that I'm too ugly.

506
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:31,649
They call me an orc.

507
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:34,840
They say that my face
is worse than garbage.

508
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:12,066
That must be so hard.

509
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:21,320
No matter what anyone says,

510
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,224
you are the most precious
person to yourself.

511
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,249
That's when I learned...

512
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,716
that kind words and nice scents...

513
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:38,048
...can even save someone's life.

514
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:41,535
I remember.

515
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:44,030
You were that girl.

516
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:45,597
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

517
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:50,315
You said you started to like perfume
because of the intangible beauty,

518
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,482
but my face is...

519
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,716
You've become much prettier.

520
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,428
Are things better now?

521
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,230
Are you okay?

522
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:12,149
I thought I'd be okay,

523
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:16,041
but anyone can tell that
I had plastic surgery, so...

524
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:21,682
Why do you say that?
You look very pretty now.

525
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,315
You are beautiful.

526
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:29,488
It's embarrassing to hear that from
such a gorgeous lady like you.

527
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,433
You see,

528
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,931
I think my life could've
been much easier...

529
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:44,970
...had I been born less pretty.

530
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,415
Did that sound obnoxious?

531
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:56,082
No, not at all. I'm just not following.

532
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,348
I liked it when I was young...

533
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:03,549
...because everyone said I looked pretty.

534
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,764
- That's Na Hye Sung. Look.
- Isn't she so pretty?

535
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:09,364
- So what? Even if she asks me out,
- The prettiest girl in our school.

536
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:10,963
- I won't date her.
- Not just in our school.

537
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:13,030
Hey, she's the prettiest girl in our town.

538
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,197
Why are you so pretty?

539
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,030
My gosh, she's really stunning.

540
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:17,164
I know. I want to be pretty too.

541
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:19,264
Girls envying me...

542
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:21,264
and guys being nice to me...

543
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:23,715
were just something I was used
to in my day-to-day life.

544
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,743
There's this saying, you know.

545
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:30,262
"A beautiful woman is like someone
who passed the bar exam."

546
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:34,760
Beauty certainly gives women power.

547
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,935
People respect you wherever you go.

548
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,824
Hye Sung.

549
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:47,114
And that's why I thought the
world would be my oyster.

550
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:52,081
I was confident that I'd succeed
in both my career and love.

551
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,282
Ms. Na,

552
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,675
do you have a boyfriend?

553
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:57,968
She must have many.

554
00:32:58,081 --> 00:33:00,579
Guys are lining up to get a date with her.

555
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:02,996
I know a very competent young man.

556
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,848
He's from a great family as well.
What do you say?

557
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:13,397
My husband looked best on paper
out of all the guys I had dated,

558
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:15,182
and his family was rich and powerful.

559
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,463
My parents were fond of him as well.

560
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:22,481
If women are flowers,

561
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:25,637
you are the most beautiful flower...

562
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:28,149
...I've ever seen.

563
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:33,115
"A beautiful flower".

564
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:35,881
Back then,

565
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,982
I had no idea that those words
would end up shackling me down.

566
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:46,858
So did you...

567
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:50,082
...have to quit your job back then?

568
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:52,949
Yes, I did.

569
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,716
It was very hard for me
to get to where I am now.

570
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,181
I see.

571
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:03,133
It was my fault too.

572
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:07,315
When people complimented my looks,
I thought they respected me.

573
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:10,482
I thought that I should be...

574
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,982
...able to have my way with any man.

575
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:16,015
I was foolish.

576
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:24,081
So you should try to date many guys.

577
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:27,348
And choose your husband wisely.

578
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,215
Got it?

579
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,782
Yes.

580
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,848
Jung Yeob, give us some sausages.

581
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:40,015
Hang on a moment.

582
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:43,216
What did you say to make
the girls all leave?

583
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,117
Are you seriously asking
me that right now?

584
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,743
Tae Young, how are we going to
handle everything tomorrow...

585
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,158
...without the girls?

586
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,749
We'll just have to do it by ourselves.

587
00:34:57,648 --> 00:35:00,449
Soo A. Ji Hyo. Did the guys text you?

588
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,235
They asked if I could make it tomorrow,

589
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,304
but I'm not available.

590
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:07,939
Me neither.

591
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:10,709
We should let them handle
everything on their own.

592
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,302
But that's not enough
to get rid of my anger.

593
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,779
Should we take revenge?

594
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,901
Yes, let's do that.

595
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:17,782
How?

596
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:29,551
Hey, why did you come home so late?
Did you go somewhere?

597
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:31,451
- Yes.
- Look at this.

598
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:34,150
What is it? Did you take a
photo with that rapper?

599
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:37,334
No, that's not what I'm about to show you.
It's something important.

600
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:41,479
Soo A commented on
Yong Chul's social media page.

601
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:43,768
Do you see the time?

602
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,835
And Yong Chul replied on
Soo A's social media page...

603
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,809
...two hours later.

604
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:53,069
That means Soo A contacted
Yong Chul first.

605
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:59,416
Look. Yong Chul wrote which schools
he graduated from on his profile.

606
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:01,002
Isn't something weird?

607
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:08,069
Do you think Soo A did this
on purpose to harass you?

608
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,768
Come on. That's absurd.

609
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,250
(Comments)

610
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:39,334
(You look great.)

611
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,001
(Mom)

612
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,050
Hey, Mom.

613
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,150
I'm going to head to your place
to give you some side dishes.

614
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:53,935
You can go to school.

615
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:57,284
You don't have class?

616
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:59,969
Then I'll get to see you today.

617
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,187
Mi Rae's staying at home today.

618
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,883
Dad's going to go with me.

619
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:08,132
I can't carry all these
side dishes by myself.

620
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:16,351
Welcome.

621
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,737
We already have so much food.
Why are you trying to buy more?

622
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,639
We never got cake for Mi Rae
after she got into college.

623
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,142
Come here and help me pick a cake.

624
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:33,169
I want this one.
The pretty one right here.

625
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:34,786
No.

626
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,669
We'll take the biggest one here.

627
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:45,991
I told you we should drive here.

628
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:49,901
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to park here.

629
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,505
It's just so heavy. That's all.

630
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:58,910
Should I help you carry that?

631
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:01,412
No, it's okay.

632
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,415
I'll carry them for you.
Where are you headed?

633
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:07,302
We're going over there.

634
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,387
Over there?

635
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,734
- My gosh.
- Oh, it's heavy.

636
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:18,363
- Over there?
- Yes. Thank you.

637
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,568
Thanks.

638
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:22,967
Come on.

639
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,368
It's right there.

640
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,176
Oh, okay.

641
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,879
Wait here. I'll get you
something to drink.

642
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,182
No, it's okay. You should go inside.

643
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,984
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

644
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,120
- Thank you.
- No problem.

645
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:46,791
My gosh, he's good-looking
and nice at the same time.

646
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:50,284
I hope we get a son-in-law like him.

647
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,797
Gosh, let's go inside. I'm so tired.

648
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,167
You brought a lot more side dishes
than I thought you would.

649
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:01,668
Ms. Na, it feels like Thanksgiving.

650
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:05,243
We should've taken you
guys to a nice restaurant.

651
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,835
It's our first meal together
after Mi Rae got into college.

652
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:11,902
Hurry up and eat.
The kids must be starving.

653
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,601
Okay.

654
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,321
You're the one who decided
to buy the biggest cake.

655
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,676
Thank you, Dad.

656
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,468
Yes, don't mention it.

657
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,451
Hyun Jung, you must be hungry.

658
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:28,336
- Hyun Jung, let's blow the candle.
- Okay.

659
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,636
Please let these girls have
a great time in college.

660
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:35,568
1, 2, 3.

661
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,469
Thank you.

662
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:43,668
Let's eat.

663
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,301
Wait.

664
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:49,558
You guys didn't get to take a
photo at the entrance ceremony,

665
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:51,250
so you should take one today.

666
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:52,970
You're right.

667
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,454
If I had a son,

668
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,987
I would've made you become
my daughter-in-law.

669
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:57,868
- Really?
- Yes.

670
00:39:58,072 --> 00:39:59,384
Go sit over there.

671
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,351
Everyone, gather together.

672
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,067
Come here.

673
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,050
I think...

674
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:06,551
you guys should sit on the sofa.
It'll look way better.

675
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:10,050
Mr. Kang, sit closer to Mi Rae.

676
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,835
- Here.
- A little closer.

677
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,301
That's nice.

678
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:17,050
Mr. Kang, I want you to
give me a big smile.

679
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:20,117
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

680
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,551
Now, that's a nice photo.

681
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:23,935
In 1, 2, 3.

682
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,426
Look over here, Mr. Kang. In 1, 2, 3.

683
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:31,547
Are you guys having fun?

684
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,600
Let's take a photo.

685
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,902
- Everyone, he's here.
- Hello. Hello.

686
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,517
- You're great.
- Thank you.

687
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:41,950
My goodness.

688
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,384
Hello, everyone.

689
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:46,702
- We're going to take a photo.
- Okay.

690
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,284
Okay, now.

691
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:49,850
Ma'am, you must be exhausted.

692
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:52,084
You should get on his back.

693
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:54,992
- He's right. Come on.
- Get on his back.

694
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,089
That's nice.

695
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:59,097
Gosh, that looks nice.
You guys are like mother and son.

696
00:40:59,196 --> 00:41:01,017
That looks perfect. Everyone, smile.

697
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:04,468
Okay, I'm going to take a photo now.
In 1, 2, 3.

698
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:08,235
Let's take one more photo. In 1, 2, 3.

699
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,202
My gosh.

700
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:15,417
I hope you stay healthy.
I love you, ma'am.

701
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:17,017
Eat up, everyone.

702
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,277
Enjoy your food. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

703
00:41:22,368 --> 00:41:23,681
Let's go.

704
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:25,783
I just got a report from my junior.

705
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:28,002
Apparently, she hasn't
really done anything yet.

706
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,888
She met up with a
female student in front of her place.

707
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:33,102
But they just parted ways after
eating ice cream together.

708
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,117
Ms. Na has a very tight schedule,

709
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:40,568
and he's apparently having
trouble following her around.

710
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,384
Instead of wasting his
time following my ex-wife,

711
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,969
he could just follow
Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee instead.

712
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:53,236
My goodness.

713
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:57,604
Do Sang Won!

714
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,620
- Do Sang Won!
- Do Sang Won!

715

718
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,992
Gosh, these jerks.

719
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:47,017
Hurry up and get out here.

720
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,163
- Come on.
- My gosh.

721
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:51,668
You guys, this is way too much.

722
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:54,561
- My gosh.
- What is this?

723
00:42:54,668 --> 00:42:55,651
They're muscles.

724
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:57,442
Do you guys seriously
want to be like this?

725
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,435
You guys should've worked out.

726
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:03,451
If you guys took care of your
body and worked out diligently,

727
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:05,450
you wouldn't have had to wear these.

728
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,652
If you don't want to wear that,
you can wear this instead.

729
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,454
You guys, this is too mean.

730
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:12,757
Exactly. You're making us look funny.

731
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,325
Well, you should at least look funny.

732
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,727
You guys aren't good-looking enough
to gather people with your looks.

733
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,417
Now, give us a funny pose.

734
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,832
- Come on. Don't take a photo.
- Gosh, forget it.

735
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,333
- Don't take a photo.
- In 1, 2...

736
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,135
- Gosh, stop it.
- Don't take that photo.

737
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,802
What are you guys doing?

738
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:27,438
Woo Young.

739
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:34,712
You guys were a mess yesterday,
and the same goes for today.

740
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,617
Who said you could wait tables
wearing that?

741
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,916
They were being immature
and told us to wear these.

742
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,397
Well, they're the ones...

743
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:43,221
...who kept insisting that only the
pretty girls could wait tables.

744
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:44,922
And they always comment
on our appearances.

745
00:43:48,907 --> 00:43:49,889
Explain this.

746
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,797
(Hankook University,
Community, Notice Board)

747
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,366
Did they volunteer to wear this outfit?

748
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,983
Well, we decided to order
skirts for their uniform.

749
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:01,472
- But they were shorter than we...
- Did you guys agree to this?

750
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,243
No, they made them wear it.

751
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,845
They didn't even care
what the freshmen said.

752
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,351
This is nothing compared
to what they did to us.

753
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:12,941
Is that why...

754
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:16,136
Was this your only solution?

755
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,435
How is it that you guys
haven't changed at all?

756
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:26,764
If you're going to keep pulling
this kind of nonsense,

757
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:28,451
just get rid of the snack bar.

758
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:29,667
I'm sorry.

759
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,036
Sorry.

760
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:40,278
My gosh.

761
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:49,068
Just forget about it and let it go.

762
00:44:49,161 --> 00:44:50,544
It's our first college festival.

763
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:53,991
It'll be unfair to let someone
like Park Yong Chul ruin it.

764
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,093
Shouldn't you be at your
department's booth?

765
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,795
You said you were late.

766
00:44:58,301 --> 00:45:00,368
Where are Yoo Eun and Jung Boon?

767
00:45:01,268 --> 00:45:02,802
They're over there.

768
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,902
Go already.

769
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:07,617
Make sure you have some real fun, okay?

770
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:09,150
Okay.

771
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,074
Bye.

772
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:11,876
Bye.

773
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:18,434
- Go already.
- Bye.

775
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:33,003
What are you doing alone?

776
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,487
I'm just looking around.

777
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,372
- What about you?
- I'm waiting for Ji Hyo.

778
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,778
I worried a lot about you yesterday.

779
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:50,501
Are you okay?

780
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:58,122
By the way,

781
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,535
I went to Yong Chul's
social media account,

782
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:07,367
and it said Jaryong Middle School
on his profile.

783
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:09,567
Didn't you see it?

784
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:12,970
I don't know.

785
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,468
Did you say you went to that school?

786
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:20,302
I don't know well about the school name.

787
00:46:22,134 --> 00:46:23,718
- Is that right?
- If I had known,

788
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:25,384
I would've told you beforehand...

789
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:28,002
...that I knew someone from
your middle school.

790
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:29,735
Don't you think so?

791
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,991
Soo A.

792
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:35,493
Hey.

793
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:37,695
I have surprising news.

794
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,384
The guys got scolded so
much by Woo Young just now.

795
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:42,035
- Really?
- Yes.

796
00:46:42,902 --> 00:46:44,302
Check this out.

797
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,084
Isn't it hilarious?

798
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:47,802
What's that?

799
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:51,225
This is even more hilarious.
Check this out.

800
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,635
Oh, my.

801
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,936
Goodness.

802
00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:58,202
There's this picture too.

803
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:17,002
Are you still down?

804
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:22,335
Did you get scolded a lot?

805
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:23,908
Yes.

806
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:26,510
What we did was wrong after all.

807
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,469
- Don't say that.
- It was wrong.

808
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:32,002
Woo Young never scolds innocent people.

809
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:43,401
I feel better whenever
I eat something sweet.

810
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:50,517
Thanks.

811
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,801
Still, you're better than all of them.

812
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:55,468
What?

813
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,935
I mean, among the guys in our department.

814
00:48:01,435 --> 00:48:03,835
Let's not stay here and go out.
It's festival time.

815
00:48:04,034 --> 00:48:05,401
Okay.

816
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:11,335
What?

817
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:13,776
It won't open.

818
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:20,568
What's wrong with this?

819
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,770
Excuse me.

820
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,873
The door won't open, so could you
try opening it from the outside?

821
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:32,777
Thank you.

822
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,068
What's wrong with it? Tae Hee, come out.

823
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:43,554
Can you open the door?

824
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:45,651
It's working.

825
00:48:45,735 --> 00:48:46,857
What's wrong with it?

826
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,226
- Maybe it's broken.
- When did it break?

827
00:48:52,435 --> 00:48:54,271
It's not fun to be with just girls.

828
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:56,057
Please don't do that.

829
00:48:56,156 --> 00:48:57,468
Do you have boyfriends, girls?

830
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:01,071
It's best if you're single, but it's
still okay even if you're taken.

831
00:49:01,163 --> 00:49:04,175
Give me just 10 minutes for this game.

832
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,376
Please come this way.

833
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:07,778
- What is it?
- Come, come.

834
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:12,383
Come this way. How pretty.

835
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:15,986
Please move inside.

836
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:17,488
Have a seat.

837
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:21,759
All right. Gosh, you guys are lucky.

838
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:25,060
You've met the prettiest
girls in our school.

839
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:28,164
- Hello.
- Hello.

840
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:32,682
Please hold for a second.
I'll go bring one more guy.

841
00:49:35,748 --> 00:49:38,636
I'm dazed because we got
dragged here all of a sudden.

842
00:49:38,721 --> 00:49:40,644
- Us too.
- It's the same here.

843
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,630
Does anyone want to be
on a group blind date?

844
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,649
Wait, Kyung Seok?

845
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,521
Should we pretend like we don't know him?

846
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:57,314
Gosh. When did he come take a seat?

847
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,030
You're so handsome.

848
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,146
I should come to my senses.

849
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,746
All right, guys. Now that
we have even numbers,

850
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,930
I'll give you 10 minutes
to get to know each other.

851
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:09,740
You'll partner up with
someone you like afterwards.

852
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:11,629
Can't we point out the person right away?

853
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,931
You must've sat here because
you have someone in mind.

854
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:19,517
Okay, who on earth is the
girl you have in mind?

855
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:24,255
Her.

856
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,729
If she says yes, they will be the
fastest couple created ever.

857
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:35,146
Will it become a group blind
date among four people?

858
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,330
Let's hear how she feels.

859
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,155
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

860
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,258
- I'm okay.
- You're all wet.

861
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,560
What should we do?

862
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:06,064
There must be extra t-shirts
in our department room.

863
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,565
Really?

864
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,264
Then I'll go first.

865
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,571
- I'll go with you.
- I'll go with you.

866
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:30,225
I'll go with Kyung Seok.

867
00:51:35,016 --> 00:51:36,026
Let's go.

868
00:51:38,821 --> 00:51:41,832
Anyway, they've become a couple.

869
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,335
Excuse me. Take the prize.

870
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,536
Excuse me.

871
00:51:59,598 --> 00:52:00,584
You want to run?

872
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:01,785
What?

873
00:52:03,697 --> 00:52:05,631
If it's embarrassing, let's run there.

874
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:12,229
Okay.

875
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,845
Don't try to calculate love
in order not to get hurt.

876
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,644
That'll only make you suffer even more.

877
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:29,513
- Okay.
- Good luck.

878
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:30,930
Thank you.

879
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:33,099
- You can do it.
- I can do it!

880
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,296
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

881
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,730
Hey, Woo Young.

882
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:46,426
This is awesome. We should've
done this kind of stuff too.

883
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:49,412
Not everyone can do this, you know.

884
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,713
Can you read my fortune too?

885
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,637
Sure. Have a seat.

886
00:52:56,943 --> 00:52:59,143
Choose one of these.

887
00:53:03,444 --> 00:53:04,348
I'll choose this one.

888
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,945
This is unexpected.

889
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:11,930
I thought you'd choose this one.

890
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,834
I know well about the
future I want, that's why.

891
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:16,627
I see.

892
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,830
All right, then. I'll start
the psychological test now.

893
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,746
Let's say you went to buy
a cozy knitted sweater.

894
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:27,313
Choose what kind of sweater
you'd buy among four options.

895
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:28,713
- Okay.
- The first one is...

896
00:53:28,797 --> 00:53:31,331
...a sweater with a big highlight pattern.

897
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,346
The second one is a striped sweater.

898
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,845
A sweater with stripes.

899
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,546
The third one is a plain sweater...

900
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,212
...in a bold color such as red or blue.

901
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,680
The fourth one is a plain sweater
in an achromatic shade...

902
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:44,154
...such as gray or black.

903
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,056
An achromatic shade...

904
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,563
- I'll go with the 3rd one.
- The 3rd one?

905
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,365
That means you want simple love.

906
00:53:55,766 --> 00:54:00,130
You prefer an uncomplicated love
to an extremely passionate one.

907
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,830
You can keep your emotions in check
no matter how upset you are.

908
00:54:05,163 --> 00:54:06,664
It's pretty accurate.

909
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,931
It can look graceful,

910
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:14,513
but on the other hand, your love...

911
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:17,046
...may be seen hypocritical as well.

912
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,255
Hypocritical?

913
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:21,458
You should try to be
honest with your feelings.

914
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,945
When you're not honest with yourself,

915
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:25,229
you can't really win someone's heart.

916
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,397
I'm very honest...

917
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,936
Right, I've been careful these days.

918
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,638
Why?

919
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,642
It's a secret.

920
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,530
Your secret will be safe with me.

921
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,617
She's a student in our department.

922
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:53,997
You mean, the chemistry department?

923
00:54:57,597 --> 00:54:59,298
I see.

924
00:55:02,663 --> 00:55:04,730
- Are we done, then?
- Yes.

925
00:55:05,357 --> 00:55:06,939
Thanks. I'll see you around.

926
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:09,031
Okay. Bye.

927
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:42,973
- My gosh.
- There it is.

928
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,275
Did you find it?

929
00:55:48,663 --> 00:55:50,346
- Here.
- Thanks.

930
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,548
I'll wait outside.

931
00:55:56,764 --> 00:55:57,654
What's going on?

932
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:00,858
What's wrong?

933
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,064
You can't open it?

934
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,065
Let me try.

935
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:22,097
Hello?

936
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,983
Anybody outside?

937
00:56:44,606 --> 00:56:46,507
Why isn't she picking up?

938
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,794
You should also try calling other people.

939
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,904
I don't have my phone now.

940
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:52,843
What?

941
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:54,444
All right. Everyone is ready, right?

942
00:56:54,563 --> 00:56:58,448
Then here we go. 1, 2, 3!

943
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:06,023
Sadly, we don't have a match.

944
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:07,224
Then I can leave, right?

945
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:09,396
Yes, you can leave.

946
00:57:19,597 --> 00:57:21,018
Whose phone is this?

947
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,097
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine either.

948
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:26,797
It must be Kyung Seok's phone.
You can give it to me.

949
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:27,844
Okay.

950
00:57:29,063 --> 00:57:30,047
(Kang Mi Rae)

951
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:31,730
(1 Missed Call)

952
00:57:36,463 --> 00:57:39,957
The person you're trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave...

953
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,859
No one's picking up.

954
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,062
I guess I lost it.

955
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,466
Eun isn't answering her phone.
Jung Boon isn't either.

956
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,468
Who else can we call?

957
00:57:53,163 --> 00:57:55,839
Shall I try calling Soo A and Ji Hyo?

958
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,142
Forget it.

959
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,946
- Just get changed first.
- What?

960
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,663
Will you wait until it dries?

961
00:58:13,497 --> 00:58:15,664
What's going on between
Kyung Seok and Mi Rae?

962
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:18,349
Could they be...

963
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,130
No, no way. That can't be.

964
00:58:23,507 --> 00:58:26,697
Is Kyung Seok trying to make you jealous?

965
00:58:27,398 --> 00:58:29,232
I don't know what you're trying to say.

966
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,309
That must be it.

967
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:35,412
Come on. Are you playing hard to get?

968
00:58:37,996 --> 00:58:39,316
What are you talking about?

969
00:58:41,096 --> 00:58:43,253
Do you think I have a crush on him?

970
00:58:57,823 --> 00:59:00,937
- I won't look.
- You shouldn't, of course.

971
00:59:19,463 --> 00:59:20,657
Are you done?

972
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,960
No, I'm not done.
I haven't even taken off...

973
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,964
Tell me when you're done.

974
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:23,854
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

975
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,556
- What? You guys were here together?
- What's going on between them?

976
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,979
I heard Kyung Seok's father
is a former congressman.

977
01:00:29,063 --> 01:00:30,680
You dropped this yesterday.

978
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:31,995
You're really the worst.

979
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,364
Ms. Na was just taken
to the emergency room.

980
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:35,579
To the emergency room?

981
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:37,879
Soo A, didn't you say
you live in Dogok-dong?

982
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,903
I moved out of my parents'
place a little while ago.

983
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:40,904
Kyung Seok.

984
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,112
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

985
01:00:42,196 --> 01:00:45,229
You would've kept misjudging
me if it weren't for Ji Hyo.

986
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,279
Yes, Woo Young.

987
01:00:46,363 --> 01:00:48,678
I'm having a housewarming party
this Saturday. Can you make it?

988
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:49,980
You'll be home late, right?

989
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,381
You have to watch a movie with Kyung Seok.

990
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,183
This is driving me crazy.
