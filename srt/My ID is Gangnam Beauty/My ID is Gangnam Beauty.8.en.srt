1
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:04,004
This doesn't work.

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,006
It looks like your dad blocked the card.

3
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:11,068
To be honest,

4
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:14,074
I can pay you for all the
help I've gotten from you.

5
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,749
But I can't hire you.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,668
I really can't afford it.

7
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,756
Why did you have to pack up
and leave the house?

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,593
I don't even know anymore.

9
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:29,667
Can I go to a housewarming
party empty-handed?

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,768
Can you give me one of those
instead of paying me?

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,401
Whose housewarming party are you going to?

12
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,009
A senior in my department.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,909
It's not brand new,

14
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,919
but it was bought recently.

15
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,134
- What? Are you lending it to me?
- No.

16
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,201
It's a gift.

17
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,801
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

18
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,867
We'll do it. You should have some too.

19
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:24,569
It's okay. I'll do it.
Don't worry about me and eat up.

20
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,360
How manly.

21
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:28,353
Thank you for the food, Woo Young.

22
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:35,742
- I'll do it.
- Don't worry. It's okay.

23
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,763
Give me that.

24
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,083
Look at this.

25
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,668
He even cut the meat into
bite-sized pieces. How thoughtful.

26
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:44,871
Yes.

27
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,789
Are you making japchae or what?

28
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,686
I'll just do it.

29
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:13,267
You should eat. Eat up.

30
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:23,477
I'll hold on to the TV for now.
Take it back whenever you need it.

31
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,778
It's too much as a gift.

32
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,350
Woo Young, do you not watch TV?

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,682
I can watch shows on my phone.
I don't want to pay the license fee.

34
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,483
Me neither. But Hyun Jung keeps
saying we should get a TV.

35
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,853
What?

36
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,350
Mi Rae is thrifty to the
point that it's annoying.

37
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,850
Even when we're buying daily necessities,

38
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:39,626
she has to buy them online
at the cheapest prices.

39
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,834
I'm the same way. I only
buy things on hot deals.

40
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:44,231
Me too. There's a flash
sale tomorrow morning.

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,732
The weekly special sale is cheaper.

42
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,535
Well, bulk deals are way cheaper.

43
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,417
A bundle of 2L-bottled
waters is only 1.5 dollars.

44
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,035
Are you serious?

45
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,641
Then let's place orders
together to go over 30 dollars...

46
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,643
...when we don't have much to buy.

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,012
Great idea. Then shipping will be free.

48
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,450
You two are so excited.

49
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,750
Oh, if you want to watch a movie,

50
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,535
do it on the last Wednesday of each month.
You'll get 50 percent off.

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,656
You're so impressive.

52
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:13,635
It's nothing to be impressed with.
I'm broke, so I have to be frugal.

53
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,035
I go for buy-1-get-1-free
deals at convenience stores.

54
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,469
When you buy one, you can
get another one for free.

55
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,579
What a downer.

56
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,086
Isn't that a guitar?

57
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,084
Can you play the guitar?

58
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,612
A little. It's just my hobby.

59
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,095
- Show us.
- Yes, please.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,397
I'm not good enough.

61
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,499
- Show us.
- Show us.

62
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,784
- Show us. Show us.
- Show us. Show us.

63
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,968
I'll show you another time.
I really mean it.

64
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,601
Show us, please.

65
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,035
That was great.

66
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,636
Just leave it. I'll wash the dishes later.

67
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,235
It's okay. I can finish this quickly.

68
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,577
I'll do it.

69
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,701
- Shall we take the garbage out?
- Yes.

70
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,970
Kyung Seok is very different from
what I thought he'd be like.

71
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,483
He gets along with people well.

72
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,473
Why? Was he quite prickly
back in middle school?

73
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,677
I wouldn't say he was "prickly" per se.
How should I put it?

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,901
Shall I say he was unapproachable?

75
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:49,450
I can't believe a guy like
that remembered Mi Rae.

76
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,984
I was so surprised.

77
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,762
I get that he hates his mom,
but she's hospitalized.

78
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,265
He could visit her at least once.

79
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,767
Why did he come here instead?

80
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,278
You still haven't opened that yet?

81
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,732
I'll do it.

82
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,517
Let's meet up often since
we're neighbors now.

83
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:48,208
How about watching a movie on the
last Wednesday of every month?

84
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,710
- I'd love that.
- Me too.

85
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,315
Mi Rae.

86
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,317
We need to watch a movie as well.

87
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:05,125
It's our assignment for
Studies on Pop Culture.

88
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,328
Oh, right.

89
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,427
Let's watch a movie together.

90
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:15,435
It's just an assignment, so
it'd be weird to turn him down.

91
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,737
Sure.

92
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,977
You need to watch a movie and
write a report on it, don't you?

93
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,164
Write the report as long as you can.

94
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,567
The professor might act like he
doesn't care about it,

95
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,967
but he still gives long
reports good grades.

96
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,317
Thank you.

97
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,526
I knew that.

98
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,728
I already heard.

99
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,528
Does he want to watch the
movie with just me...

100
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,036
...or with other friends?

101
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:02,248
See you.

102
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,410
Do you want to meet up
after school tomorrow?

103
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,187
Okay, sure.

104
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,588
My class finishes at 4pm.

105
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,889
My last class is at...

106
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,491
Aren't you done by 5pm?

107
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,693
Yes, my class finishes at 5pm.

108
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,496
Then I'll wait.

109
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,697
Okay.

110
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,500
What? Is it going to
be just the two of us?

111
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,403
Where do you guys live?

112
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,105
We live up there.

113
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,909
See you.

114
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,910
Bye.

115
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,022
Bye.

116
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,234
They live really nearby.

117
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:05,213
I'm so happy for you, Mi Rae.

118
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,629
It's your first time
watching a movie with a guy.

119
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,863
On top of that, it's with
a really handsome guy.

120
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,052
We're just doing our assignment.

121
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:14,248
Do you think...

122
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,247
...Kyung Seok likes you?

123
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,227
What do you think about him?

124
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,328
Are you not interested?

125
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,162
Fine, I'm interested in him. Okay?

126
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,363
How about we just call today
our first day of dating?

127
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,563
My gosh, you touched your
feet with those hands.

128
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,337
Stop it.

129
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,148
- My gosh.
- Move.

130
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,942
Hey, hurry up and wash up.

131
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,463
Stop touching me with your feet. Stop it.

132
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,048
Go and wash up.

133
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,282
I'll wash first.

134
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,845
Let's meet at Sinchon Cinetown...

135
00:09:58,178 --> 00:09:59,645
...at 6pm.

136
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,269
What?

137
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,005
This really feels like a date.

138
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,126
I think my business is failing.

139
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,146
How about you skip class tomorrow
and go to the beach with me?

140
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,363
I have plans to watch a movie.

141
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,561
A movie? With who?

142
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,212
I need to do my assignment
for Studies on Pop Culture.

143
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:37,337
You must have money to buy movie tickets.

144
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,428
- No, I don't.
- What?

145
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,644
I don't have money. Lend me some.

146
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,348
My gosh, how did you end up penniless?

147
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,446
Here.

148
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:55,855
Lend me 50 dollars.

149
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,428
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,361
I also need money for popcorn and dinner.

151
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,261
Popcorn, my foot.

152
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,062
Be honest with me.
You're going on a date, aren't you?

153
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,666
- It's just an assignment.
- Sure, it is.

154
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,604
Hey, stop it.

155
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,112
It's not a date.

156
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:43,778
It's just an assignment.

157
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,194
It's just an assignment.

158
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,779
Let's see how this looks.

159
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:10,833
Hey, I...

160
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,237
I need to go to the bookstore.

161
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,335
I forgot to buy some reference books.

162
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,236
Should I go with you?

163
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,705
No. No, it's okay.

164
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,394
You... You need to get to class.

165
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:22,795
You should go first.

166
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,577
Okay, I'll see you later.

167
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,578
Okay.

168
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,247
Oh, I almost forgot.

169
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:31,351
Will you be home late since you're
watching a movie with Kyung Seok?

170
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,994
I'm going to go home as
soon as the movie ends.

171
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:37,357
What?

172
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,959
Were you also planning
to do some other stuff?

173
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,162
Gosh, just go.

174
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,661
Mi Rae, you can come home late.

175
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,739
Just go. We're only
going to watch a movie.

176
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:07,742
Are you looking for something?

177
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,241
I'm looking for pink lipstick.

178
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:11,930
The lipsticks are placed over here.

179
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,761
And you know there are so many
different kinds of pink, right?

180
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,362
There's salmon pink, coral pink,

181
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,561
rose pink, magenta pink, and cherry pink.

182
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:21,668
Coral pink comes with both
pearls and no pearls.

183
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:22,962
I see.

184
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:25,571
Gosh, you look like a peach.

185
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,573
- Pardon?
- Don't you know your fruit?

186
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,575
Joy from Red Velvet looks like an apple,

187
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,862
and Sulli looks like a peach.

188
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,394
You also look like a peach.

189
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,680
Really?

190
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,394
But you must not have a lot of
experience putting on makeup.

191
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:38,384
You have a warm undertone,

192
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,386
but your makeup is for people
who have cool undertones.

193
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,288
I see.

194
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,492
Just wait here. I'll fix
your makeup for you.

195
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,095
Okay, thank you.

196
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,207
Girls start wearing makeup as
soon as they enter middle school,

197
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:04,711
and that's when they also
start perming their bangs.

198
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,613
But I had never done any of that.

199
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,428
What's this brand?

200
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:13,119
Look at the case. It's so pretty.

201
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:37,756
I was scared that others would
make fun of my looks...

202
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,246
...even after I wore makeup
and permed my hair.

203
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,119
Gosh, you look so pretty.

204
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,989
Let's finish up by putting
some lip gloss on you.

205
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,479
Gosh, you look so pretty and cute.
Have a look in the mirror.

206
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,398
Look in the mirror and smile.

207
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,578
How pretty. You really look like a peach.

208
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,105
You're so pretty.

209
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,009
The cotton pads are 10 dollars.

210
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,928
The cotton pads are 10 dollars?

211
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,312
They're quite pricey, aren't they?

212
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,215
But if you buy over a certain amount,

213
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,994
you'll be getting a travel kit for free.

214
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,988
This actually costs over 30 dollars,

215
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,691
so you'll be saving 15
dollars if you buy all this.

216
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,506
Why did I buy this?

217
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,212
How many perfumes do I need to sell?

218
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,661
- Hey.
- Yes?

219
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:53,261
Can you not tell anyone about
what you saw that day?

220
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:55,254
What did I see?

221
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,511
We had an after-party on
the day of the festival.

222
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:01,727
Tae Young and I are slowly
getting to know each other.

223
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,612
So please keep it a secret for now.

224
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,046
What exactly are you talking about?

225
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,628
The fact that I'm dating Tae Young.

226
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,535
You're dating Tae Young?

227
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:11,737
Be quiet.

228
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,812
Really? Are you serious?

229
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,328
You... Do you not remember?

230
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,010
I cannot believe this.

231
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,584
Hey, it's a secret. Don't tell anyone.

232
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,486
How did that happen?

233
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,099
I'm not drunk at all.

234
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,402
Okay. So what is this about?

235
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,705
I've never done this in my entire life.

236
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,807
Don't laugh at me after hearing me out.

237
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,012
Don't laugh.

238
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,283
I like you.

239
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,189
- I told you not to laugh at me.
- I didn't laugh at you.

240
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:05,879
Yes, you did. You laughed.

241
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,746
- I didn't mean it like that.
- My gosh.

242
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,146
That's not it.

243
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,567
You fool.

244
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,779
What are you two doing?

245
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,380
Hey, I can't see.

246
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,081
Ye Na.

247
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:30,383
Well...

248
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,457
- You can't tell anyone, okay?
- I got it.

249
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,964
You saw everything.

250
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:49,669
- Hello.
- Hi.

251
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,679
You got home safely that night, right?

252
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,445
Sorry? That night? Yes.

253
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,079
You got home safely too, right?

254
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,648
I was so busy trying to take care
of the drunk students that night.

255
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,161
I didn't get to see you off.

256
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,846
Being the student president
is hard, isn't it?

257
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,146
It's not that hard.

258
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,813
If there's anything I can help you
with, please tell me anytime.

259
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:16,128
Okay.

260
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,132
Call me when you want to grab a drink too.

261
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,703
What?

262
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,512
I'm a huge fan of yours.

263
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:29,775
Okay.

264
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,211
I see.

265
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,937
Is she sick or something?

266
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,055
No, she's just hungover.

267
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:49,428
She drank with her friends from
her hometown over the weekend.

268
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,866
I'm about to die. They'd better
not come visit me again.

269
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,234
Did a lot of your friends come?

270
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:58,471
Hey, she said six guy
friends came to visit her.

271
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,442
You have a lot of guy friends.

272
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,645
I only have guy friends.

273
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,046
But I don't have a boyfriend.

274
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,862
Is there anyone you like?

275
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,046
I like all of them,
but I don't want to date them.

276
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,146
If I want to date them,
I can't stay friends with them.

277
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,945
Help me up, please?

278
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,945
By the way, you look nice today.

279
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,337
What do you mean?

280
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,773
Why didn't you come to the
after-party, by the way?

281
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,546
You said you'd come even if it was late.

282
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,977
Something came up that night.

283
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,879
I understand then.

284
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,281
Let's go.

285
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,554
("Making 500,000 Dollars with 50 Dollars")

286
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:01,515
Are you already preparing for the finals?

287
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,713
No, I just needed to read up on something.

288
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:11,677
You left the after-party
early without saying bye.

289
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,112
Must I say goodbye?

290
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,580
I just had to do something.

291
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,920
(Kang Mi Rae)

292
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:25,991
Like what?

293
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:28,321
Something I had to do.

294
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:35,501
I thought you and I had become friends.

295
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,893
Kyung Seok, do you want to
go watch a movie with me?

296
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:47,346
Let's do the assignment for
the Studies on Pop Culture.

297
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,026
I'm already watching a
movie with someone else.

298
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,252
- Who is it?
- Kang Mi Rae.

299
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,227
I see.

300
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:09,292
Right now, I'm on my way
to meet a guy friend.

301
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,227
Mi Rae.

302
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,060
What are you doing there?

303
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,710
I didn't see you there.

304
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,215
Which movie do you want to watch?

305
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,418
- I bought the tickets.
- You did?

306
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,620
Good job, buddy.

307
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,224
How much do I owe you?

308
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,025
That's fine.

309
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:51,442
How can I help you?

310
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:54,543
- One original combo, please.
- That'd be 8 dollars and 50 cents.

311
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:01,847
Hey, why are you paying for everything?

312
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,848
That's fine.

313
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,860
It's not fine.

314
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:21,185
It's 13 dollars and 25 cents.

315
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,168
I'll give you 25 cents later.

316
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:25,442
I said, it's fine.

317
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,539
Quit saying that.

318
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,743
Take it. Friends usually go Dutch.

319
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,661
Is it too early to go in yet?

320
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,427
We have some time left.

321
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:58,671
Oh, right. Don't we have to attach
the movie ticket on our report?

322
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,872
Do we have to?

323
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,874
Probably?

324
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,559
- Should I split it in half?
- You'll split it?

325
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:18,592
Then how about one of us
submits a photo of it?

326
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,726
I'll take a photo, then.

327
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:32,905
Mi Rae.

328
00:24:59,223 --> 00:25:00,966
Let's get a good mark on the assignment.

329
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,267
We can do it.

330
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,587
Oh, Soo A.

331
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:23,308
What are you doing here?

332
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:25,509
I came to drop off the pickles I made.

333
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:27,593
I told you I can take care of myself.

334
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:38,370
Gosh, don't walk so fast.

335
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,557
The apartment in Dogok-dong...

336
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:01,260
Was it all a lie?

337
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:23,749
What is the message the director
wants to impart through the movie?

338
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,653
Which elements excite the viewers
and can make this movie a hit?

339
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,356
I should pick the most memorable scene.

340
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,426
Which scene would I want to watch again...

341
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,682
Why do I...

342
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,185
...keep wanting to look at him?

343
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:16,068
It must be an instinct.

344
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,593
A basic instinct.

345
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,382
Our eyes are always
drawn to pretty things.

346
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,760
It doesn't mean we have
an affection for them.

347
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,188
We just can't help but stare at them.

348
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,360
Instinctually, that is.

349
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:16,655
You don't want any popcorn?

350
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:21,533
Oh, right.

351
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,372
In most romantic movies, this is when...

352
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,427
This is usually how the plot unfolds.

353
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,247
You're not going to have any?

354
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,749
I'm going to eat some.

355
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,331
This trick allows you to
prevent such an incident.

356
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,812
What are you doing?

357
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,317
What? You told me to eat popcorn.

358
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,753
I'm eating it now.

359
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:07,005
It was such a fun movie.

360
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,141
There will be a lot to write about.

361
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,511
I know.

362
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,916
Is it now time to part ways?

363
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:21,008
Aren't you hungry?

364
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:21,820
What?

365
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,008
Do you like pasta?

366
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,223
Pasta?

367
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,928
Isn't that what people
usually eat on a date?

368
00:30:30,826 --> 00:30:32,030
We can have something else if you want.

369
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,232
It's okay.

370
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,993
I like everything. I'm an omnivore.

371
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,193
All right, then. Let's go.

372
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:54,110
This restaurant is so nice.

373
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,501
Have you been here before?

374
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:58,107
No, I found it online.

375
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,808
He looked up restaurants online?

376
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,427
To take me?

377
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:32,760
I'll get aglio e olio pasta.

378
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:43,835
Excuse me.

379
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,939
Yes, what would you like to order?

380
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,641
We'll each get aglio e olio pasta and...

381
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,411
What do you want to drink?

382
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,208
I'll just stick with water.

383
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:56,415
Get something else. I'll get
the lemon-flavored soda.

384
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,850
Then I'll get the same.

385
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,152
We'll get two of it, then.

386
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,154
Sure, no problem.

387
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:09,550
Did you take a lot of notes earlier?

388
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,669
What?

389
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,264
You took notes while watching the movie.

390
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,366
Show me what you wrote.

391
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,342
You have to write about what
you thought about the movie.

392
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,140
You shouldn't be influenced by my opinion.

393
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,041
I never said I'd copy what you wrote.
I'm just curious.

394
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,346
What's there to be curious about?
I just wrote down obvious things.

395
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,549
Your handwriting.

396
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,960
I want to see what it looks like.

397
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,353
But why?

398
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,857
I'm just curious.

399
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,159
Do I have to have a reason?

400
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,834
Excuse me for a moment.
I have to use the restroom.

401
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:09,960
Is it possible?

402
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,492
To think of a guy like
that just as a friend.

403
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:18,660
Can someone like me really do that?

404
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,842
Isn't that guy so handsome?

405
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,359
Totally. Oh, my.

406
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:33,810
His girlfriend must be super pretty.

407
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:38,776
- He's really good-looking.
- He's unbelievably handsome.

408
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,559
I know, right?

409
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:50,727
Why didn't you eat?

410
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:52,327
Because you weren't here yet.

411
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,644
Hey,

412
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:07,746
when's your birthday?

413
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,214
What?

414
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,650
We're friends, but I don't
know your birthday.

415
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,555
You want to know so many things.
Just eat up.

416
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,642
I won't ever let myself...

417
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,759
...get high hopes by
telling him my birthday.

418
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,968
Then don't tell Woo Young either.

419
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,960
- Don't tell him what?
- Your birthday.

420
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:18,409
(Searching for a roommate,
Monthly pay: 100 dollars)

421
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,609
(I'm searching for a roommate...)

422
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:21,327
(who wants to live at a
rooftop near our school.)

423
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:28,860
- Let's split the bill.
- It's 30 dollars.

424
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:31,693
- Here you go.
- Hey.

425
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:35,423
Why didn't you pay for the pork belly
that Woo Young bought?

426
00:35:35,622 --> 00:35:36,839
- What?
- You didn't pay for that.

427
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:38,425
So why are you trying to pay for this?

428
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:42,340
That's because he's the
one who invited us.

429
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,142
I'm the one who suggested
to watch a movie...

430
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,111
...and eat dinner together.

431
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:50,715
Goodbye.

432
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:54,919
Bye.

433
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,950
The weather forecast didn't
say it would rain today.

434
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:14,305
I have seven dollars left.

435
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,559
Will that be enough to
pay for the cab fare?

436
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:25,960
Just a moment.

437
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:40,696
Hello.

438
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:44,629
Can I have one more of this?

439
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,911
That's the only one we have left.

440
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,881
- You can take this.
- What about you?

441
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:13,398
I can run to the bus stop.

442
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,793
Let's go together. I'll walk you there.

443
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:25,119
Let's go.

444
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:27,912
No, it's okay.
It's too small for two people.

445
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,692
You can take it.

446
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,519
Then you take it.

447
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,424
Hey. Hey.

448
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,770
You're getting all wet. Get under here.

449
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,372
Then you'll get wet.

450
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,274
You should come closer.

451
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:19,860
The umbrella is so small, isn't it?

452
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:23,193
Yes.

453
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,626
Are you wearing perfume?

454
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:35,592
No, I don't wear perfume
that often these days.

455
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,545
Is it because I told you
that I don't like it?

456
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,993
Well, not exactly.

457
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:52,359
I...

458
00:38:54,037 --> 00:38:55,538
...went to the hospital that day.

459
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:57,035
What?

460
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:04,509
I met her.

461
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:08,913
I see.

462
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,692
Don't you want to know how it went?

463
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,559
I figured you wouldn't want me to ask.

464
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,103
How did it go?

465
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:25,196
It went quite well.

466
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:28,566
Really?

467
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,893
You should wear that perfume.

468
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:41,613
I'll do what I want.
I'm not going to do as you say.

469
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,859
Forget it, then.

470
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,293
I'm relieved.

471
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,862
About what?

472
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,266
I'm relieved that you don't hate your mom.

473
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,640
Thanks.

474
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,509
No problem.

475
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,346
Seo Yoo Jin moved out of his apartment...

476
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:24,065
...and is living at his bar.

477
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:25,575
Seeing that he moved out,

478
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,558
I'm guessing his business
isn't doing that well.

479
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,060
So I'm worried whether he'll even be
able to buy meals for Kyung Seok.

480
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,742
The elections are coming up soon,

481
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,660
but your kids are only causing trouble.

482
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,969
You must be going through
a lot these days.

483
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,371
Do you know where Hye Sung lives?

484
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:44,260
Let's go there.

485
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,977
Okay.

486
00:40:53,478 --> 00:40:54,686
It's...

487
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,588
...not raining anymore.

488
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,391
You're right.

489
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:06,564
You should go now.

490
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,342
It stopped raining.

491
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:11,235
Here. You bought this.

492
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,793
Okay.

493
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,726
- See you.
- Bye.

494
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:25,960
Wait.

495
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,108
Take it.

496
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,426
It might rain again.

497
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:48,866
Okay.

498
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:50,875
Thanks.

499
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,144
No problem.

500
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,515
I'm the one who should thank you
for walking me all the way here.

501
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,493
See you.

502
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:09,511
I'll get a heart disease at this rate.

503
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,993
I definitely realized it.

504
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,561
I can't...

505
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:38,594
...think of Kyung Seok
as just a guy friend.

506
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,044
Stay healthy.

507
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:09,954
Who is it?

508
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,960
Hello, Ms. Na Hye Sung.

509
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:14,047
Who is this?

510
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:15,841
Sorry to visit you at this hour.
I know we haven't met.

511
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,561
My name is Jung Young Mo.

512
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:21,732
It's me.

513
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,590
What do you think you're doing?

514
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:44,712
Is this your way of getting back at me?

515
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,991
How did you find me here?

516
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:49,985
Did you have someone look into me?

517
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,918
Do you still have no respect for me?

518
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:54,539
That you would barge into my
home in the middle of the night?

519
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:02,194
Send Kyung Seok home.

520
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,809
- What?
- Are you pretending to be clueless?

521
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,779
After Kyung Seok met with you
yesterday, he left home.

522
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:14,409
You told him that I hit you...

523
00:44:14,896 --> 00:44:17,230
...when you saw him again after 10 years?

524
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:20,892
I didn't tell him that.

525
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:22,332
You didn't?

526
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:27,632
Only two of us know what
happened between us.

527
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,293
Then you told him.

528
00:44:36,025 --> 00:44:37,717
Where is Kyung Seok now?

529
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,345
If you know where he is,
will you take him?

530
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:43,648
That's up to Kyung Seok.

531
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:48,172
Get out if that's all you came to say.

532
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:05,266
It's been 10 years since
you last met, right?

533
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,371
- Keep yourself under control.
- Yes, sir.

534
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:28,147
What's up this weather?

535
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,767
Let's go.

536
00:45:32,365 --> 00:45:34,132
Gosh, it's so uncomfortable.

537
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,380
You're back.

538
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:40,638
What are you doing?

539
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:45,929
How did you sleep on the couch?
I almost fell when I turned.

540
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:47,678
I don't move when I sleep.

541
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:50,114
You should take the room tonight.

542
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:53,513
That's fine. Don't make me call
911 after you fall off there.

543
00:45:56,747 --> 00:45:59,963
I might move back home.

544
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:02,663
If I move back in after
using up the deposit,

545
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:04,762
my dad really might kill me.

546
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,165
When will you go back?

547
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,468
I don't know. I should ask my mom first.

548
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,872
You should move back in too.

549
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,905
- Stop being a rebel.
- I won't move back in.

550
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,372
If you don't, how will you get by?

551
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:20,990
I'll get a part-time job.
I'll get a place too.

552
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,348
Just put up with me until then.

553
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,672
Hey, you think you're
better than me, right?

554
00:46:27,756 --> 00:46:32,156
Making a living in this world
isn't that easy. Got that?

555
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:36,560
Get the lights. I'm going to sleep.

556
00:46:40,856 --> 00:46:42,456
Is there a specific job you'd like?

557
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:43,267
No.

558
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:46,772
No questions regarding your
family or your personal life.

559
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:48,376
You can't submit the copy
of your family registry.

560
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:50,295
No jobs that require you to talk a lot.

561
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,576
You can't work every day or overtime,

562
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:55,079
but you want a job that pays well?

563
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:55,970
Yes.

564
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,183
I think...

565
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:02,086
...it'd be better if you
look for a job yourself.

566
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:03,487
Pardon?

567
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:05,405
There must be a lot of job postings...

568
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,958
...on the recruiting website
or the school website.

569
00:47:12,256 --> 00:47:13,672
- I'll go a little later.
- Okay.

570
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:17,168
(Job Placement Office)

571
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:24,093
Why is he coming out of this office?

572
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:27,257
Why are you coming out of here?

573
00:47:28,422 --> 00:47:30,223
Why did he come out of this office?

574
00:47:31,928 --> 00:47:33,462
- Thank you.
- Sure.

575
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,757
Ta-da.

576
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:42,861
Isn't this cool?

577
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:44,161
Here.

578
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:48,021
- Jung Ho.
- Yes?

579
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:52,269
You know the expression,
"Little strokes fell great oaks"?

580
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,839
That applies to trees, not to people.

581
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,074
Then you should give up on Kyung Seok.

582
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,844
- Why?
- He's a person too.

583
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:03,355
You little runt!

584
00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:10,855
I saw Kyung Seok coming out
from the job placement office.

585
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,823
Why would he go there?

586
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,959
A rich guy wouldn't need a part-time job.

587
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,670
He's polishing up his reputation.

588
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:18,763
Like even a son of a congressman
has a part-time job too.

589
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,748
He's not a congressman anymore.

590
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:22,670
He will be a mayor soon.

591
00:48:31,816 --> 00:48:35,728
That jerk, Kyung Seok.
That explains his behavior.

592
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:46,037
What's up with this jerk?
Why does he order me around?

593
00:49:01,988 --> 00:49:04,188
Let's put some distance.
Put some distance.

594
00:49:05,253 --> 00:49:08,187
It won't be awkward after some time.

595
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:16,253
(Studio in Prime Location, Cool
Studio for 600 Dollars a Month)

596
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,255
(Rooftop house near school,
looking for a roommate)

597
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,554
(The rent is 100 dollars. We'll
discuss details in person.)

598
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:22,026
What are you doing?

599
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:31,011
Was the movie you watched yesterday fun?

600
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,002
Yes.

601
00:49:38,886 --> 00:49:40,587
I'm a bit busy right now.

602
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,432
Drink this, buddy. Goodness.

603
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,118
Look at that. I've never
seen him walk that fast.

604
00:49:58,215 --> 00:50:00,731
It always looked like he was
annoyed by everything around him.

605
00:50:01,153 --> 00:50:03,100
What? He's even running now?

606
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,002
Hey, Do Kyung Seok is running.
He's running.

607
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,604
What's going on? What is this?

608
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:11,520
Just like any other day,
I'm talking to myself.

609
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,811
What are you doing?

610
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:18,215
Hey, didn't Do Kyung Seok
wear that the other day?

611
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,270
That's not 55 dollars. It's 550 dollars?

612
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:23,788
Come on.

613
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,257
Buddy.

614
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:31,495
No matter how great it is,
don't copy someone else.

615
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,997
I didn't say I was going to buy it.

616
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,099
I won't buy it.

617
00:50:35,487 --> 00:50:37,887
"I won't buy it." It's more
like you can't afford it.

618
00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:42,488
Hey, you drink it.

619
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:44,937
What do you know about
my family's finances?

620
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:47,570
Oh, my. How are the finances?

621
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:50,355
How are they? Tell me.

622
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,300
We're better off than yours.

623
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:02,714
What do you know about
my family's finances?

624
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:05,177
If you keep skipping
classes, you can't graduate.

625
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,403
Do you want to stay one more semester?

626
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:08,938
It's just that it's embarrassing.

627
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:12,634
Could you come to classes after
being humiliated by a freshman?

628
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,748
Then apologize to him like an
upper class and clear the air.

629
00:51:15,843 --> 00:51:17,241
Don't avoid him.

630
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,844
I should've done that then.
It's too late now.

631
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:27,351
Is it true? Is Do Kyung Seok...

632
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,452
What?

633
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:30,354
Nothing.

634
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,459
What is this?

635
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,961
Unbelievable.

636

(Office of Chemistry Department,
Teaching Assistant: Yeon Woo Young)

637
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:01,020
Long time no see.

638
00:52:01,323 --> 00:52:02,723
Yes.

639
00:52:05,354 --> 00:52:06,936
You've been well, right?

640
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,354
Yes.

641
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:12,670
I've been wanting to see you.

642
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,003
Can we talk for a second?

643
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,366
I'm busy right now.

644
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:18,370
You're busy.

645
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:20,769
Then I'll see you later.

646
00:52:20,853 --> 00:52:21,939
Okay.

647
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:32,588
Had I known, I wouldn't have done that.

648
00:52:37,477 --> 00:52:39,657
You want to move into my place?

649
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,103
- Why?
- I moved out.

650
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:44,495
You moved out, but you don't have a place?

651

- No.
- If you moved out, why don't...

652
00:52:48,387 --> 00:52:49,566
Did you run away from home?

653
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,086
I don't want a short-term roommate.

654
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,473
It's not short-term. It's long-term.

655
00:52:58,994 --> 00:53:00,110
Take a seat.

656
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:10,401
Did you read up on the terms?

657
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,624
But as for the first month,

658
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,826
could you accept the TV
I gave you as my rent?

659
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,929
- Come again?
- A microwave or a coffee maker?

660
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,232
I saw that you don't have either.

661
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,535
Do you have no money?

662
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,738
- I'll pay as soon as I get paid.
- So you did run away from home.

663
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,420
I said I moved out to live on my own.

664
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:37,631
Have you already found one?
I mean, a roommate.

665
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:38,749
No, not yet.

666
00:53:42,632 --> 00:53:44,064
Then let's do this.

667
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:49,226
(Agreement)

668
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,028
Just pay 70 dollars a month,

669
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:53,330
but you must take care of
all the housework, okay?

670
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,735
(Agreement)

671
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,236
(Yeon Woo Young, Do Kyung Seok)

672
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:06,009
Well, just pay 30 dollars more if
you don't want to do housework.

673
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,465
I'll do it. I'll take care
of all the housework.

674
00:54:17,183 --> 00:54:19,363
Oh, it must be that way.

675
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:21,792
Put the side dishes in the fridge
and come back out quickly.

676
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,586
I should cut up the watermelon at least.

677
00:54:23,713 --> 00:54:25,696
They won't eat it if I leave it like that.

678
00:54:25,897 --> 00:54:28,699
I can't park on the street for that long.

679
00:54:28,963 --> 00:54:31,602
All right. I'll be quick.

680
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:37,107
My gosh, it's that guy.

681
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:40,310
- Pull over for a moment.
- Why? Who is he?

682
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:47,012
My gosh, it's so nice to
run into you like this.

683
00:54:47,096 --> 00:54:48,697
Do you remember me?

684
00:54:48,864 --> 00:54:50,498
Oh, yes. Hello.

685
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:54,164
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

686
00:54:55,497 --> 00:54:58,095
Thank you so much for
everything the other day.

687
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,012
Where are you headed? Get in.
We'll give you a ride.

688
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,697
Oh, it's okay. I live right there.

689
00:55:04,003 --> 00:55:05,269
Mom.

690
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,771
- Are you getting home now?
- What's up?

691
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,475
- Hello.
- Hi.

692
00:55:13,764 --> 00:55:16,265
- He's a senior in my department.
- Really?

693
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,884
You and my daughter are
in the same department.

694
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,586
Yes, hello.

695
00:55:22,788 --> 00:55:24,688
- It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

696
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:35,599
Does he live alone too?

697
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:36,900
Yes.

698
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,504
How old is he?

699
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,806
I guess he's around 26?

700
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,008
So he's six years older.

701
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:47,813
Take some of these side dishes to him.

702
00:55:47,897 --> 00:55:49,498
Oh, take some watermelon too.

703
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,014
To Woo Young?

704
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,417
He probably never buys watermelons
because he lives alone.

705
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,319
I'll cut it up for you. Take some to him.

706
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:57,321
- Okay.
- Hurry up already!

707
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,131
Can't he just drive around
the block if he can't park?

708
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,727
Make sure you take it to him.

709
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:37,879
Yes, Ms. Na.

710
00:56:37,963 --> 00:56:40,963
- How have you been?
- Good.

711
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:43,664
How are you feeling? Are you better now?

712
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:47,871
Yes, I'm fine now. Thank you so
much for your help that day.

713
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,373
No problem.

714
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,080
How's Kyung Seok?
Is everything well with him?

715
00:56:55,526 --> 00:56:58,360
Yes, he's doing great.

716
00:57:01,729 --> 00:57:04,955
I heard that you two finally met.

717
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,364
Yes, thank you for that too.

718
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,264
Well, could you give me
Kyung Seok's number?

719
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:16,046
I forgot to ask him that day.

720
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,964
Sure, I'll send it to you right away.

721
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:22,598
Okay. Take care. Bye.

722
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,597
(Do Kyung Seok)

723
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:32,864
(Kang Mi Rae)

724
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:54,805
Who is it?

725
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,707
Hey, Mi Rae.

726
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:02,430
My mom wanted me to give you this.

727
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:06,149
- Your mom?
- Yes.

728
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,730
Take the containers.
Come in for a few minutes.

729
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,528
Make sure you tell your mom
that I thanked her.

730
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,730
Okay.

731
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,433
You should put everything in the
fridge as soon as possible.

732
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,434
Oh, right.

733
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,031
Let's see.

734
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:37,047
Hey, what are you doing here?

735
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,149
I live here now.

736
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:47,657
What?

737
00:59:03,464 --> 00:59:07,577
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

738
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,513
Exactly in a month from now, your rent...

739
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:12,416
...and half of the utilities are due.
Also, we'll buy our own food, okay?

740
00:59:13,197 --> 00:59:15,218
Look at that. Woo Young is so sweet.

741
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,621
Don't you think that guy,
Woo Young, likes Mi Rae?

742
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,079
- Hello.
- Hello.

743
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,113
Hi.

744
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:21,691
Then do you live with your grandparents?

745
00:59:21,797 --> 00:59:23,794
You suddenly have a lot
of questions for me.

746
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:27,197
Do Kyung Seok and Hyun Soo A.
They look so lovely together.

747
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,598
You haven't found a part-time job yet?

748
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:30,901
Shall I set up an interview
for you at the place I work?

749
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:34,204
You owe Mi Rae an apology, not me.
