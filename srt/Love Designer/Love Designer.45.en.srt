00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,680
of money now.

175
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
I hope this can help you.

176
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
If you want to make up to me,

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,280
there is ample time ahead.

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,920
Bai Sai Group's President

179
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,320
and CEO, Su Yu Shan

180
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,160
has announced today that

181
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
he will take an early retirement

182
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,080
effective from today.

183
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,960
The company will be

184
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,160
handled by a professional manager.

185
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,240
Su Yu Shan's action

186
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,320
has caused a public uproar.

187
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,720
We have now arrived at

188
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,520
the press conference

189
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
and will interview Su Yu Shan

190
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,360
with regards to this matter.

191
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
Please tune in to Finance Frontline.

192
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,480
President Su,

193
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,040
how do you plan to handle

194
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,120
your shares in Bai Sai Group

195
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
and Wan Feng Group?

196
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,880
They will be kept untouched

197
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
for the moment.

198
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,240
President Su,

199
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
what are the considerations

200
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,600
behind

201
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,640
your decision today?

202
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,000
Everyone is very curious

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,760
and confused

204
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
about your action.

205
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,920
This should be understandable.

206
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
A lot of people

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
set targets

208
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,480
in their lives.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,920
For example,

210
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,920
to retire after earning a certain amount.

211
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Or

212
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
to retire after achieving financial freedom.

213
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
However, some people

214
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,880
achieve their targets,

215
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
but being driven by benefits,

216
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
they break their promises.

217
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,200
They start to keep fighting.

218
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,480
On the battlefield,

219
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,400
there will always be new targets

220
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,440
and new problems.

221
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
It's never-ending.

222
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,000
Do you get tired

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,040
of the intensive workload?

224
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,480
Can I

225
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,280
put it that way?

226
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,880
There is just something more important

227
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,480
and something I'm more passionate about

228
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,160
waiting for me.

229
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,880
You're back.

230
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,160
Sorry for all these years.

232
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,520
You kept waiting for me at home.

233
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,080
I'm back.

234
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,120
I'm really back this time.

235
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,320
Have one.

236
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,000
It's so sweet.

237
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,520
Can you two stop being mushy?

238
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,920
Are you bullying me for being single?

239
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,280
Chen,

240
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm bullying you. I'm bullying you.

241
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,360
Wait a minute.

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
Let me take a photo first.

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
This is the fruit cut by

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
the famous Designer Zhou.

245
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,400
I need to post it on my Moments

246
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,080
to show off.

247
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,040
You're exaggerating, Wang He.

248
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,520
I'm not exaggerating.

249
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,640
You are

250
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,160
nominated for

251
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
a first-class international prize.

252
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,320
Soon, you'll be

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,520
a first-class international designer

254
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,240
I need to take this chance

255
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,920
to ride your coattails

256
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,480
and praise you more.

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,040
I might cut my finger if you keep this up.

258
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,080
She doesn't need your praise.

259
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
So what if I praise her?

260
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,520
Why does my baby need your praise?

261
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,560
Let me tell you.

262
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,920
Luckily, I proposed to her early.

263
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,440
Or else, I wouldn't

264
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,120
be able to get her now.

265
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,280
We haven't registered yet.

266
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,360
Can I back out?

267
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,840
It's too late to back out now.

268
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,080
You two, enough.

269
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,840
You're not the only one with a partner.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
So what if I have a partner?

271
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,600
What?

272
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Wu San, come.

273
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,160
What?

274
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,680
Who doesn't have one?

275
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,320
I have something

276
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
to tell you.

277
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
Wu San and I...

278
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,400
Next month,

279
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,800
we'll go on our honeymoon trip.

280
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,200
We won't have a wedding.

281
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,520
So, no red packets.

282
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,760
That's good.

283
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,000
But there's something

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,920
I have to tell you.

285
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,640
Extend the leave

286
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,480
for my Wu San.

287
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,200
No problem. For how long?

288
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,160
A month.

289
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,360
A month only?

290
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,320
It's not enough.

291
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,320
Half a year.

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is half a year enough?

293
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
A year then.

294
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,520
I'll give you five years

295
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,680
and you don't have to come back, okay?

296
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,400
Sure. Just pay the salary as usual.

297
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,040
What salary?

298
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,320
-Paid leave.
-Asking me for salary?

299
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,840
Old Song.

300
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,800
Sister-in-law.

301
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,720
Why are you back?

302
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,800
When did you come back?

303
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,560
Why did you tell us?

304
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,320
How did you come?

305
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,840
I saw that you

306
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,960
looked unhappy sometime ago.

307
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,840
So we came back to cheer you up.

308
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,760
What's there

309
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,680
for me to be unhappy about?

310
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,080
The main agenda is to

311
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,480
attend your wedding.

312
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,040
That's right.

313
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Boss, everything's all set.

314
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,120
You can go and have fun now.

315
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Let's go. We can talk later.

316
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,920
-Go!
-Let's go!

317
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,240
Let's go.

318
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,320
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

319
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
Go, go.

Let me tell you.

339
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,200
This year,

340
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,440
there are only three students

341
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,840
who got the full scholarship in our school.

342
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,400
I am one of them.

343
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,360
How is it?

344
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,480
Have you ever expected

345
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,360
your sister to be

346
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,280
a top student one day?

347
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,120
My sister is too amazing now.

348
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,160
Really.

349
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,120
Compared with your brother in the past,

350
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
you're this close to catch up.

351
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,320
That's good. You really made me proud.

352
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,720
Look at how amazing you are now.

353
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,960
If our parents know about this,

354
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,160
they'll sure be very happy.

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,440
Right?

356
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,040
Before I go back to school,

357
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,120
let's visit them.

358
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,120
We can visit Grandma as well.

359
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,640
I haven't seen her for a long time.

360
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,680
Sure.

361
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll find a time to take you back.

362
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,880
Good job!

363
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,880
Good job.

364
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,040
Well done.

365
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,480
Well done.

366
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,320
Miss Lu Na,

367
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,160
why did you choose

368
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,080
to collaborate with

369
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,800
Qian Jin Group

370
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,680
for the charity program,

371
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,640
'Hello, Qian Jin'?

372
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,760
I feel that

373
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,600
young people nowadays

374
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,520
are pretty stressed out,

375
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,440
especially women.

376
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,680
Plus, there is

377
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,000
a lack of women's

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,200
health knowledge.

379
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,080
So I hope that

380
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,320
through this program,

381
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
we can encourage more women

382
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
to love themselves and protect themselves.

383
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
Aside from

384
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,080
this charity film,

385
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,520
what are

386
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,600
your plans after this?

387
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,840
How about asking my manager?

388
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,240
Where is your manager then?

389
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,040
Wang He.

390
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,200
Coming.

391
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,400
Here. Put this on.

392
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
I'm not cold.

393
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,400
What do you mean you're not cold?

394
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,760
If you catch a cold,

395
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
I need to take care of you.

396
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,720
Whether or not I'm sick,

397
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,800
you'll still have to take care of me.

398
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,760
About Miss Lu Na's agenda,

399
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,880
we'll make an official announcement.

400
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,840
You've all worked hard today.

401
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,920
She needs to rest now.

402
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,320
Thank you.

403
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,800
-Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you.

404
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Grandma!

405
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,120
Grandma!

406
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,600
Did you miss me?

407
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
I miss you.

408
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,440
Grandma.

409
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,360
Kid.

410
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,840
Good kid.

411
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Did you miss me?

412
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,880
I miss you.

413
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,440
Zhou Fang, this is my grandma.

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,600
Why are you trying to act close?

415
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,320
This kid.

416
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,280
Grandma, don't mind her.

417
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.

418
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,880
Di, come.

419
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
Grandma, this is my nephew,

420
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Shen Di.

421
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,920
He's Luo Luo's classmate.

422
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,640
Hello, Grandma.

423
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,520
Hello, hello.

424
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,800
You're Di?

425
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,360
I often heard Luo Luo talk about you.

426
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,720
Hurry. Let's go inside.

427
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,480
Here. Let's go in.

428
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
Here. Go in.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,760
Let's go in.

430
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,120
It's hard to break.

431
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,960
Grandma, let me tell you.

432
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,080
Big bro is so sleazy.

433
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,120
Ever since Zhou Fang

434
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,840
moved opposite our house,

435
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,520
he'd always stare out

436
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
from the balcony.

437
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Stop lying.

438
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,080
When did I stare out

439
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,920
from the balcony?

440
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,320
You did always stare out from the balcony.

441
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,680
I always saw you

442
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
stare out from the balcony.

443
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm not lying at all.

444
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Grandma, don't listen to him.

445
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,720
Grandma, don't listen to them.

446
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,480
Auntie.

447
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,760
You're the same.

448
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,840
Didn't you always

449
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,760
stare out from the balcony?

450
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,400
Shut up.

451
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
Did you see that?

452
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,720
Both of them are stalkers.

453
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
What are you saying?

454
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,840
I'll feed you raw corn.

455
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Hurry and peel.

456
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,640
Did you see it, Grandma?

457
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,720
We're telling the truth.

458
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Isn't that because your auntie missed me?

459
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,520
Yeah. She's just too embarrassed to say it.

460
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,920
Come. Put it down. Your hands...

461
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,200
It's okay, Grandma. I can do it.

462
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,720
Grandma, why dote on her?

463
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,360
You should make her work more.

464
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,200
Look at what's inside.

465
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,120
Look.

466
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,920
Does your arm hurt?

467
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,200
It's okay.

468
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
We're uncomfortable anyway

469
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,600
as the chair's angle

470
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,360
is not right.

471
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,400
We should go and make

472
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,120
a comfortable chair and put it here.

473
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,960
Lie down and enjoy stars

474
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
when we have time.

475
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,920
Sounds good.

476
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
I know a craftsman

477
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
who makes chairs by hand.

478
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,200
I can ask him

479
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,080
to make one for us.

480
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,280
Why do you know everything?

481
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,200
After we eat,

482
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
we can put the chair here,

483
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,240
lie on it and enjoy stars,

484
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
bathe in the sun. It is pretty comfortable.

485
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,920
When you enjoy stars,

486
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,720
how can you bathe in the sun?

487
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,440
Can't we enjoy stars at night,

488
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,080
bathe in the sun in the day?

489
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,280
Song Lin.

490
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,920
Have you ever thought that

491
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,120
for your application,

492
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,640
aside from making

493
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
haute couture apparel,

494
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,120
shoes and jewelry,

495
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
what else

496
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,280
can it possibly make?

497
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Nothing's impossible.

498
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,960
We can make some

499
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,640
beautiful chairs,

500
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,800
sofas, coffee tables etc.

501
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,520
Some daily necessities.

502
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
In this way, we can also

503
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,840
increase the number of users.

504
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,400
And I think

505
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,120
it can be divided

506
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,360
into a few sections.

507
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
For instance, some sections

508
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
are for high-end apparel,

509
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,640
high-end shoes,

510
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,280
and jewelry.

511
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,600
And another section

512
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,560
can be for

513
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,160
the high-end customized daily necessities.

514
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,640
There can also be

515
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,600
another offline section.

516
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,920
To bring these people

517
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,960
with similar interests,

518
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,480
designers with a similar style,

519
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,520
together

520
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,320
to get to know each other

521
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,280
and make friends.

522
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,360
We can also increase our connections.

523
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,160
Actually, the reasons we do haute couture line,

524
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,080
on the one hand,

525
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,360
are to provide our users and customers

526
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,080
with the most comfortable,

527
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,800
and the most personalized

528
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,160
apparel.

529
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
On the other hand,

530
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,120
at a great extent, we are actually

531
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
protecting the core craftsmanship

532
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,680
of there designers

533
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
and craftsmen.

534
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,480
Am I right?

535
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,560
We're considered to have

536
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,680
done something sentimental.

537
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah.

538
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Plus, I feel that now,

539
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,240
more and more people

540
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,000
know

541
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
what they want.

542
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,720
They won't pursue

543
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,760
some big brands blindly

544
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,960
and use some famous logos

545
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,160
to show off their capabilities.

546
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,000
Instead, they can confidently

547
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,200
pursue the lifestyle

548
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,360
that they want.

549
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,360
That's why they say

550
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,280
haute couture exists

551
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,040
to help people customize

552
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,040
a high-end lifestyle.

553
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,320
I think this might actually work.

554
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Why are you so smart?

555
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
Is it because you're pretty?

556
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,080
Make a guess.

557
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,240
Are you cold?

558
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,720
A little bit.

559
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,760
Sweetheart, what time is it now?

560
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,520
They're still not here.

561
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,840
Zhou Fang was at

562
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,480
the dressing room just now.

563
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,440
She was gone after that.

564
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
Lin said he wanted to use the washroom

565
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,600
and he was gone in a blink of an eye.

566
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,880
What are they

567
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
up to?

568
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,400
Well. Let's find them separately.

569
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,880
Auntie, we're here.

570
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,720
OK.

571
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,080
Sit down.

572
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,280
You must be wondering

573
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,440
why we show up

574
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
riding a motorcycle?

575
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
This unconventional way of our appearance is used,

576
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,240
because Zhou Fang and I

577
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,560
got to know each other

578
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,280
because of a motorcycle.

579
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,240
At first,

580
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
to me, Zhou Fang was

581
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,200
a very annoying,

582
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,440
very difficult person.

583
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
You're not dead, right?

584
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
Do you want to die?

585
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,240
You're the one who wanted to die!

586
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,440
You drove too fast around the curve!

587
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:28,960
Do you even

588
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,880
have any common sense?

589
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,960
You're crazy!

590
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,720
Wearing like this and

591
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
walking in the middle of the road.

592
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,880
Desperate woman!

593
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,080
Are you out hunting for men?

594
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,280
You're a man.

595
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,400
Can't you push the motorcycle yourself?

596
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,640
I almost broke my arm, okay?

597
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,560
Push it for me and I'll treat you to a meal.

00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,720
We're not suitable for each other.

694
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,440
You rejected me because of Song Lin.

695
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,800
You like him.

696
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,120
Yes.

697
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,320
Hello, hello.

698
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,120
Shen Pei Pei,

699
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,080
what are you trying to do?

700
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm not trying to do anything.

701
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,320
I just wanted to...

702
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
Do you think this is fun?

703
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,080
I just wanted to come and see you.

704
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,600
But I'm worried if you see you,

705
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,680
you might get unhappy.

706
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,480
So, this was the only way.

707
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
Are you free tomorrow night?

708
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Yes.

709
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,280
Think of what to eat.

710
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,000
Life always throws us a question

711
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,920
when we expect it the least.

712
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,560
But it also prepares a surprise for us

713
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,840
around the corner.

714
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,080
We all had dreams.

715
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
We all imagined
the endless possibilities of our future.

716
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,960
But it always turns out more exciting.

717
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,199
Whether we're facing failure,

718
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,080
or in a hard time,

719
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,440
as long as we stand firm

720
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,760
of what we believed from the start,

721
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,040
have faith that the current situation

722
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,920
is not the end of our story.

723
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,000
As long as we keep moving forward,

724
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,480
we'll be able to break away from the storm

725
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,239
and welcome the rainbow.

726
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,080
Just have faith in tomorrow.

727
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,760
That hotpot restaurant

728
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,639
is really good.

729
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,400
Wait until we come back,

730
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,280
let's eat there together.

731
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,960
Sure.

732
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,480
Come back on time, okay?

733
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Don't play for too long.

734
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,680
I know.

735
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,840
Okay.

736
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,320
Okay, we can leave now.

737
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,160
You've got everything, right?

738
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,320
Luggage, toiletries,

739
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,680
passport, visa... Everything, right?

740
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,520
Stop worrying.

741
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,080
I might be careless

742
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,240
but Wu San is meticulous.

743
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,200
There won't be any problem.

744
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,920
Fine.

745
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,800
You'll be driving

746
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,360
to Europe.

747
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
I'm worried.

748
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,760
Please be safe.

749
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,080
Don't worry, Miss Fang.

750
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,680
I will send messages

751
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,320
in the group chat.

752
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,960
And you.

753
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,480
Don't quarrel

754
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,520
and come back in the middle of the trip.

755
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,920
I know.

756
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,800
Don't miss me too much.

757
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Be good.

758
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,760
Okay. I'll wait for you to come back.

759
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,680
During this time,

760
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,720
have a good rest.

761
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,480
Make use of the holiday.

762
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,400
If he calls you,

763
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,080
don't pick up.

764
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,880
Lin.

765
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
Sister-in-law has said it.

766
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,160
I'll listen to her.

767
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,920
President Song.

768
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,560
While I'm not here,

769
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,760
you have to

770
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
take good care of my Zhou Fang.

771
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
I know. Don't worry.

772
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,680
Come here.

773
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,640
I'll get going then.

774
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
Be careful.

775
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,560
-We'll go now.
-Okay.

776
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,120
Bye.

777
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,320
If there's anything, tell me.

778
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
If he bullies you, tell me.

779
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,560
Okay.

780
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,440
You'll come back and beat me?

781
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,240
I'll beat you.

782
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,000
Enough. Stop fighting.

783
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,200
I want to travel too.

784
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Where to?

785
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,920
Zhouzhuang.

786
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,000
Do you want to have a baby?

787
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,160
If we have a baby,

788
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,080
what should the name be?

789
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,040
Song Zhou Zi.

790
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,080
Song Zhou Er.

791
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,000
Which one's nicer?

792
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,080
They're not nice. Neither of them.

793
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,920
Neither of them is nice?

794
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,120

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,680

the offer.

800
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,480
No, no. What offer?

801
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,080
That... Speak Mandarin, okay?

802
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,920
Speak Mandarin.

803
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,680
Admission offer.

804
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,480
The offer

805
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,680
from Stanford University.

806
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,600
Really?

807
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,840
Di is too amazing.

808
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,840
Too amazing.

809
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920

810
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,240

Luo Luo, Luo Luo.

812
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,160
Has she received it?

813
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,640
Of course.

814
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,840

I won't let you hear it.

00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,760
of fulfilling our dreams.

867
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,280
We achieve our goals

868
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,040
and set new goals.

869
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,080
We keep working hard to move forward

870
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,600
not just to reach

871
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,800
the milestone in our hearts,

872
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
but enjoy

873
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,760
the scenery along the way.

874
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,080
Come on.

875
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,080
Do you still remember here?

876
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Of course, I remember.

877
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,920
You almost hit and

878
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,640
killed me here.

879
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,760
That's all you remember?

880
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,960
If you had killed me then,

881
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
you wouldn't have a wife now.

882
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,160
Really?

883
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,800
It's hard to say.

884
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,600
I hate you, you're annoying.

885
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,760
Get down.

886
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Hurry. Get down.

887
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,400
Time flies.

888
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,560
It's been one year now.

889
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,720
We've experienced a lot

890
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,640
for the past one year.

891
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,960
Thank you.

892
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,200
For what?

893
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,000
Thanks for tolerating and understanding me.

894
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120
Thanks for being my husband.

895
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,240
Actually, when I first

896
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,040
saw you,

897
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,000
I thought that you were special.

898
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,040
What's special?

899
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,760
Especially silly.

900
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
No, no.

901
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,920
I thought that you...

902
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,960
I can't really tell the feeling.

903
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
I guess I like you.

904
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,800
If you like me when we first met,

905
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,640
why did you sue me

906
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,520
after that?

907
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,600
Like is like.

908
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,000
Love is love.

909
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,320
But principles are principles, right?

910
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,420

911

912
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,800
Dear.

913
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,840
I want to thank you too.

914
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,840
Thank me for what?

915
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,720
Thanks for

916
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,160
unleashing me from

917
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,880
my boring life.

918
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,840
If I hadn't met you,

919
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,560
my life would revolve

920
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,320
around work only.

921
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,640
I'd like to thank you

922
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,080
for giving me a warm home.

923
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
And thank you

924
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,520
for giving me

925
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,040
such a good wife.

926
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,680
Don't you think

927
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
our home still lacks something?

928
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,880
Lacks something?

929
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,680

930
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,820

Did you just find out?

939
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,440
I just knew.

940
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

941
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,080
You can't see anything.

942
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,200
My son. Where's my son?

943
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Have you

944
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,880
thought of the name?

945
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,320
How about Song You Zi?

946
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,560
No. Let's go with Song You Cai.

947
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,200
Song You Cai?

948
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,440
Each one of us is

949
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,560
the protagonist of our story.

950
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,760
We are waiting

951
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,920

952
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,880
the right place to meet the right person.

953
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,800
We search for each other

954
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,080
so that

955

on the path towards happiness,

956
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,520
there would be someone by our side to cheer us on.

957
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,040
I hope that the person

958
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,440
who will eventually be by your side

959
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,480
