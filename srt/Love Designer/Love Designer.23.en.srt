00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,520
I thought you were cold-hearted.

177
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
But as I got to know you more,

178
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,000
I realized you're pretty warm.

179
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
Isn't she your bestie?

180
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,680
So it's also

181
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,720
considered my problem.

182
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,400
In the future, you should

183
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,560
express yourself more like this.

184
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
Or else, people would think

185
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,280
that you're an emotionless robot.

186
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,560
There's no need to.

187
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
I only want to show my good side

188
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,360
to the people around me.

189
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,600
It's limited?

190
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,840
Of course, it's limited.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,280
If it isn't, would you cherish it?

192
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,320
Fine.

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,680
After the new releases went online,

194
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,720
the reaction was pretty good.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,480
I saw it.

196
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
The sales were pretty good too.

197
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,960
You You is doing the live stream.

198
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,840
And...

199
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,240
What are you doing?

200
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,320
My mom.

201
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,600
Auntie.

202
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,800
What are you doing?

203
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
You scared me.

204
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
I dropped something. I'm looking for it.

205
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
Auntie, you're here for a stroll?

206
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Zhou Fang.

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
Zhou Fang!

208
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,000
Auntie.

209
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Zhou Fang isn't with me.

210
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,040
Zhou Fang!

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,040
Auntie.

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,360
She's really not with me.

213
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,400
Zhou Fang!

214
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Zhou Fang.

215
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,480
Zhou Fang!

216
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Why do you meet my mom like

217
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,560
you meet the teacher in elementary school?

218
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
Isn't this all because of you?

219
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Or else, why would I be scared of your mom?

220
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll go in now.

221
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,280
She'll be back in a bit.

222
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,600
Go.

223
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,680
Good night.

224
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,960
What's going on?

225
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,920
What's going on?

226
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,680
Can't sleep?

227
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,280
Mom.

228
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,920
Why did you two

229
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,840
hide it from me?

230
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,200
Did you think that

231
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
I wouldn't handle it?

232
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,680
Did you treat me

233
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,760
as a child?

234
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
In your hearts,

235
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
am I that lousy?

236
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,640
I have nothing

237
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,520
for you to be proud of.

238
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,760
Both of you must be

239
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
disappointed in me.

240
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,960
We were scared that

241
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
you'd get sad if you knew it.

242
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
But in our

243
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,440
eyes,

244
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,480
our child is always our child.

245
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,760
This has nothing to do with

246
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
what kind of person you are.

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,320
All parents

248
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,840
behave like this.

249
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
Although you

250
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,640
haven't been the most obedient
since you were small,

251
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
and you got into trouble since you were small.

252
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
But

253
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,440
you're kind,

254
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,640
open-minded, optimistic and free.

255
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,480
Nothing

256
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,800
is more important than these.

257
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,640
Your dad and I

258
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,920
have always been proud of you.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Mom.

260
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,520
Miss Fang, your new releases this season

261
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,280
look so good.

262
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,240
Many people will like them.

263
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,560
Miss Fang.

264
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,240
Is this the one

265
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,880
to be featured later?

266
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,840
It's this one. Hurry and bring it over.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,440
Okay.

268
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you think

269
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,720
during our live stream later,

270
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,040
would You You be mocked?

271
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,320
She won't be, Miss Fang.

272
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,880
Netizens wouldn't remember that.

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,640
There are many

274
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,240
big entertainment news

275
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
to gossip about right now.

276
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
Small news like yours,

277
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,960
not many people

278
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,720
would hold onto it.

279
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Don't get too worried.

280
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,240
Oh, right. I want to tell you something.

281
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,280
Today, I contacted

282
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,960
a friend.

283
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,960
He told me,

284
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,800
two days ago, Wang Ze Yang

285
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
wanted to borrow money from him.

286
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Apparently, Wang Ze Yang's

287
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,280
previous company failed

288
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,320
and he's now in debt.

289
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
He's a calculative person.

290
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
Why didn't he consider

291
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,280
about this possibility?

292
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,640
Can your friend

293
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,600
join hands with us?

294
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
What's the plan?

295
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,080
Just tell him that

296
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,280
it's okay to lend him money,

297
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,560
but it can only be in cash.

298
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
Ask him to collect it in person.

299
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,760
Nice plan. I'll get it done now.

300
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
How is it? Is it done?

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
We can start anytime.

302
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Good.

303
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,520
You You, don't get nervous.

304
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,840
Everyone, get ready.

305
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
This first round of promotion

306
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
depends on you all.

307
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,720
Show some enthusiasm.

308
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,520
All the best!

309
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,480
Hurry. Get ready.

310
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,280
I'll press start.

311
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
Prompter, prompter.

312
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Three, two, one.

313
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,160
Hello,

314
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,720
everyone in the live stream.

315
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,560
I am You You.

316
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I can see that a lot of cuties

317
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,080
are waiting for me.

318
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,480
Old Shen.

319
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,680
Uncle is sick.

320
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
It must be hard for you and Auntie

321
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
to keep staying overnight.

322
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm not occupied today.

323
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,800
I can stay overnight today.

324
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,360
I have cooked up some delicious food.

325
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,440
Eat while they're hot.

326
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm not hungry.

327
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,280
Okay.

328
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,200
When you're hungry,

329
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,920
I'll heat them for you.

330
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,319
Let's go.

331
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,319
Mom.

332
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,240
-I have something to tell you.
-Sure.

333
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,319
What's the matter?

334
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,359
Mom, you ask Shen Yuan to stay overnight.

335
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,160
Is that appropriate?

336
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,960
What's not appropriate?

337
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,440
We've known him

338
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,480
since he was small.

339
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,640
He's no different

340
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
from our own child.

341
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,960
What if he misunderstands?

342
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,040
That's better.

343
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
I would be happier.

344
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,840
Mom, what do you have in mind?

345
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,440
Have you never

346
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,880
considered about Shen Yuan?

347
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,280
Why would I consider him?

348
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,240
Then,

349
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
why don't you consider him?

350
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,360
This child

351
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
has a staid personality

352
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,160
and he respects the elderly.

353
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,040
Most importantly,

354
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,480
he has been fond of you for years.

355
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
His feelings towards you

356
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,800
can stand the test of anything.

357
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,080
Since I was young,

358
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,480
I only saw him as an elder brother.

359
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
I won't have that kind of

360
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,560
feelings towards him.

361
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,280
You only have feelings towards Zuo.

362
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
You want to marry him.

363
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,480
I know.

364
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,320
When you youngsters are in a relationship,

365
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,240
you always think that this kind of feelings

366
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,720
can last forever.

367
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,280
But the truth is,

368
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,440
it's not possible at all.

369
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
As time passes

370
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,320
and passion fades away,

371
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,680
for two people to stay together,

372
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,960
they need to consider

373
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,520
their outlooks on the world and life, values,

374
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,040
and a person's

375
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,360
character and morality.

376
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,440
To be honest,

377
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,800
your dad really wants

378
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,080
to see

379
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,160
you settle down.

380
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,600
He hopes that

381
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,280
you can get married sooner.

382
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,320
Just take Shen Yuan

383
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,040
into consideration.

384
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,000
I will never hurt you.

385
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,280
He is definitely

386
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,640
the most suitable candidate for your marriage.

387
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,920
If he's by your side,

388
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,080
your dad and I

389
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,920
won't be worried anymore.

390
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,360
It's not going to happen.

391
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Nothing's going to happen
between me and him

392
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,360
I understand.

393
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,840
But I still hope that you

394
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,360
can think carefully.

395
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,200
Is feeling

396
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
really something reliable?

397
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,600
When does it come?

398
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
When does it go?

399
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,360
Is it something you can control?

400
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,520
Yes.

401
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,440
You and Zuo

402
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
have only known each other for a few months.

403
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,800
Of course, you have feelings.

404
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,680
But he's so young.

405
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,120
Nothing is stable for him yet.

406
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,160
What?

407
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,640
Are you really thinking of

408
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
watching him grow?

409
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
The problem is

410
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,000
you watch him grow,

411
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
he gets matured.

412
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
Does he still need you?

413
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,640
I want to go back home.

414
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,400
Okay.

415
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,320
Are you done?

416
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,360
I really want to ask you.

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,720
How did you do it?

418
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,880
You're actually rejected

419
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,040
by your mother-in-law

420
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,920
and got restrictions.

421
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
I guess having money and looks

422
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
are still not enough.

423
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,080
If you keep blabbering,

424
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
I will cut your brake line,

425
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,560
you hear me?

426
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,080
No, no, no.

427
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,160
This is too expensive.

428
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,400
I was wrong.

429
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,440
Why do I feel

430
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,560
so unsettled today?

431
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,480
So deeply in love that you're troubled.

432
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I'll make a call.

433
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,800
♪ Riding the motorbike that I love. ♪

434
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,720
Hello? What are you up to?

435
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,080
Nothing much.

436
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
I'm worried about you, so I asked.

437
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,240
He's coming out now.

438
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,680
I can't talk to you now.

439
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,800
I have something on.

440
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,000
What kind of stupid joke is this?

441
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,120
Asked me to come over

442
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,240
but never showed up.

443
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,560
What should we do?

444
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,600
Go after him.

445
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,320
Fasten your seatbelt.

446
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,800
It should be this unit.

447
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
I'll give you one more week.

448
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,760
If you don't pay us back,

449
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,880
don't blame us for being ruthless.

450
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
This kind of person

451
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
needs to be taught his lesson.

452
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,360
Or else, he won't pay us back.

453
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,520
Let's go.

454
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,200
Okay.

455
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,040
Why are you both here?

456
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
Are you here to help me?

457
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,600
Don't touch her! Wang Ze Yang.

458
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,720
Wang Ze Yang, don't you misunderstand.

459
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,000
We are like

460
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,800
the gang just now.

461
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,000
We're here to get even.

462
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,120
Get even?

463
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,680
Zhou Fang.

464
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,720
I know you're not someone

465
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,840
who'd hit me when I'm down, right?

466
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,560
You must have known me wrong.

467
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,800
I am this kind of person.

468
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,440
Stop it with your moral coercion.

469
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,720
For a person like you,

470
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,760
no mercy is needed.

471
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,160
Pei Pei.

472
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,800
What happened to you?

473
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,920
You didn't

474
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,640
speak in this way?

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,960
We were so happy back then.

476
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,920
Did you forget all about it?

477
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
Shut up. You're grossing me out.

478
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,240
Wang Ze Yang. You are really something.

479
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
I didn't argue with you,

480
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
but you picked on me instead.

481
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,560
The design sketch at Izumino's

482
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,520
was stolen by you, right?

483
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,040
Zhou Fang.

484
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,440
I have my reasons.

485
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,760
Or else, I would never

486
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,600
earn this kind of money.

487
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,120
Look at my injury.

488
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Now, look at my house.

489
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,240
What a mess did they make?

490
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,280
If I can't pay them back,

491
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,200
it won't be

492
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
just kick next time.

493
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,400
Plus, I've already been

494
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,800
listed as a dishonest person by the bank.

495
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,560
Even if I want to,

496
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,400
I can't get a loan.

497
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
Pei Pei, you know

498
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,920
the feelings we had.

499
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
I treated you so well.

500
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,480
Did you forget everything?

501
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
Help me. Help me, will you?

502
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,240
Wang Ze Yang,

503
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
are you insane?

504
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,320
The things that you said,

505
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
what do they have to do with us?

506
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,840
You dug your own grave,

507
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
you fill it yourself.

508
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,520
Yes, I dug my own grave.

509
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,360
But I really have no other ways now.

510
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,080
You two are good at earning money.

511
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,400
Just see it as poverty relief.

512
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,480
Lend me some.

513
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,520
When I have the money,

514
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,280
I'll pay you back.

515
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,240
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,

516
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Wang Ze Yang?

517
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,360
Just for that bit of money,

518
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
You even framed me.

519
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,640
I had no choice.

520
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
The money was right in front of me.

521
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,680
Please, understand.

522
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
Why should I understand you?

523
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,000
Think about it...

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,280
why I should understand you?

525
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,160
If you still have a bit of conscience,

526
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,440
take out the original design sketch

527
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,600
and destroy it in front of us.

528
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,520
Then, I'll consider

529
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,960
whether to hold you responsible.

530
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,560
I thought you two came

531
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
to help me.

532
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
But it was actually for this.

533
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000
If you want the original sketch, fine.

534
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,920
Exchange for it with money.

535
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,480
Wang Ze Yang, you're amazing.

536
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,760
Even now, you're still thinking of earning money?

537
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
How much can you earn from this?

538
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,760
Not much.

539
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,280
Two million.

540
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,000
Let alone two million,

541
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,440
I don't even want to

542
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,240
give you two yuan.

543
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,960
Then, you can't blame me.

544
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
I've been with you for

545
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,280
so many years anyway.

546
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
It's not hard to earn a bit of money.

547
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,440
Oh, yeah.

548
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,880
Shen Pei Pei.

549
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,360
If you had got your dad

550
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,760
invest in my company earlier,

551
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,480
would I be in

552
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,400
this kind of mess?

553
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
You're partially responsible for it.

554
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,800
Wang Ze Yang! Even now,

555
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
you're still saying these things.

556
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,680
Are you even a human?

557
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,400
I only have this rotten life anyway.

558
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,160
Don't you two want to hit me?

559
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,440
Hit me!

560
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,520
If you want, use the money to exchange for it.

561
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,360
No money, no sketch.

562
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,680
In your dreams.

563
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
In my dreams?

564
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,200
I'll be in my dreams then.

565
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,360
You don't want to pay for it,

566
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,760
someone else would pay!

567
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,800
Hello?

568
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,840
Is that President Song?

569
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm Wang Ze Yang.

570
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
Zhou Fang's original sketch that was

571
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
deemed plagiarized is with me.

572
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,760
If you're interested,

573
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
we can meet up and talk.

574
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,000
When?

575
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,200
How about tomorrow?

576
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,240
What about now?

577
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
Where are you? Send me an address.

578
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,920
I'll come to you.

579
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,960
Okay.

580
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,360
I'll send you my location.

581
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,750
[Song Lin]

582
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,760
Hello?

583
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,800
Song Lin, Song Lin.

584
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm just telling you,

585
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
if Wang Ze Yang contacts you,

586
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,080
don't bother about him.

587
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,040
Why?

588
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,560
If he contacts you again,

589
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,320
just ignore him.

590
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,200
Don't pick up his call.

591
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
He wants to extort money from you.

592
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Don't worry.

593
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,520
I know what I'm doing.

594
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll hang up now.

595
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
I know what you're saying.

596
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,280
That's good.

597
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,480
President Song.

598
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
You're a big boss.

599
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,400
Just spend a little money,

600
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,160
so Zhou Fang can feel at ease.

601
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,800
Am I right?

602
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Look at you.

603
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
You can even steal Zhou Fang's

604
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,000
design sketch to register for copyright.

605
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,520
That's dirty.

606
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,560
So, what if it's dirty?

607
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,120
We're all busy.

608
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,280
I don't want to talk sense into you either.

609
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
Come forward.

610
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,160
Clarify. Apologize.

611
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
I won't hold you liable.

612
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,080
President Song, maybe you're

613
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,320
still not clear of the situation.

614
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,280
It's not you

615
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,240
holding me liable now.

616
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,120
It's whether I

617
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,920
hold Zhou Fang liable.

618
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,000
I'll tell you openly.

619
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,920
On the copyright letter,

620
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,520
there is

621
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
my name, Wang Ze Yang.

622
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,280
I've said what I wanted to say.

623
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,480
I've told you what

624
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,440
I need to tell you.

625
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,280
Suit yourself.

626
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,920
Not holding you liable

627
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,800
is my last bit of mercy towards you.

628
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,400
I knew

629
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,680
I came for nothing.

630
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't play with me.

631
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,840
Just wait and see.

632
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,240
Zhou Fang!

633
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,600
Zhou Fang, open the door!

634
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,680
Dad! Mom! Open the door!

635
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,360
Who's this drunkard?

636
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,800
Shouting in the middle of the night.

637
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,400
Open the door.

638
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,560
It's Fang Fang's ex-boyfriend.

639
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,160
I heard that he's a jerk.

640
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,800
What are you looking at?!

641
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,920
Who are you calling a jerk?!

642
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,800
You're a jerk!

643
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,520
What are you talking about?

644
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,680
Come here!

645
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,040
Who is it?

646
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,320
Dad.

647
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,920
It's me.

648
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,320

Aren't you and Old Zhou at home?

655
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,920
Someone has been

656
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,200
shouting downstairs for a while now.

657
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,600
Shout about what?

658
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
I'm not there. Old Zhou's at home.

659
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,920
Now...

660
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,920
He stopped shouting now.

661
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,320
He probably drank too much.

662
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,080
Has he left?

663
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,240
I'll go and have a look.

664
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,280
Okay, okay. I know.

665
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,640
I'll call Old Zhou.

666
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,760
Sorry.

Wang Ze Yang?

678
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,160
Chatted with him for a bit.

What did you chat with him?

680
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,920
I don't know what was wrong with him.

681
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,600
He just went crazy

682
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,520
and came to my house.

683
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,800
He seemed drunk too.

684
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,200
Where are you now?

685
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,400
My mom and I are

You have to stand up for me.

Didn't I do it

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,840
for you and mom,

697
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,960
for Zhou Fang?

698
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
I really treated you

699
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
as my real parents.

700
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,040
If you don't help me...

701
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,320
If you don't help me,

702
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,400
I can only die.

703
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
If I die,

704
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,720
we'll have to die together,

705
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,240
as a whole family.

706
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,320
Ze Yang.

707
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,960
Listen to me.

708
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,720
You calm down now,

709
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,400
okay?

710
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,960
I'm calm.

711
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,080
I'm calm.

712
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,080
How am I not calm?

713
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,040
Tell me.

714
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,920
I just want to be treated fairly.

715
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,040
Why?

716
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,200
Why is this world

717
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,560
so unfair?

718
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,840
Ze Yang.

719
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,640
Ze Yang! Put the knife down!

720
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,360
Dad!

721
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,320
Wang Ze Yang! What are you doing?

722
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,160
Wang Ze Yang, can you stop it?

723
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm telling you,

724
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,960
I must have been blind!

725
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,920
I used to

726
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,560
treat you like my own child!

727
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,960
Your own child?

728
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,440
What is Wang Ze Yang?

729
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,640
What am I to all of you?

730
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,200
Aren't I just

731
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,600
the so-called 'phoenix man'*?
(*Lit.: A self-made man with a humble origin)

732
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,840
Put the knife down!

733
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,200
I can't rise again anyway.

734
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,080
Let's die together.

735
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,840
Zhou Fang.

736
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,840
Don't come near.

737
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,200
Let's die.

738
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,800
Zhou Fang, come here.

739
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,240
Dad.

740
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,000
I've lost everything

741
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,440
anyway.

742
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,200
Put the knife down!

743
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,520
Put...

744
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,080
Put down!

745
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,880
Die together with me.

746
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,600
Die together.

747
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,520
Dad, be careful.

748
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,880
Hurry, call the police!

749
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,960
Call the police!

750
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,600
Well.

751
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,320
Where's the knife? My fruit knife.

752
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,640
Let go! Let go of me!

753
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,040
Okay. It's all okay now.

754
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,520
Everything's over now. Don't overthink it.

755
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,400
It's a bit cold, right?

756
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,480
You wear it. You're cold too.

757
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,320
It's okay. It's okay.

758
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,240
I'm okay. You wear it.

759
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,040
Men don't get cold.

760
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,960
Men are human beings too.

761
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,360
Don't treat me as a human being.

762
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,080
I'm not a human being.

763
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,040
Give me your hand.

764
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,440
Right hand.

765
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,440
Why?

766
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,000
My hand is cold.

767
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,560
Your hand is cold?

768
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,400
I'll go in now.

769
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,480
My parents should still be awake.

770
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,159
Go.

771
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,760
Zhou Fang.

772
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,320
In the future, this kind of dangerous situation,

773
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,239
you have to tell me.

774
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,080
Don't act tough.

775
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
Put on your armor first.

776
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,440
Go back and rest well.

777
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,320
I've done

778
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,239
something great today.

779
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,120
Is there any prize?

780
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,920
You name it, I'll think about it.

781
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Think about it?

782
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,600
Then, kabe-don*.
(*Lit.: Wall bam in Japanese)

783
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,480
Here.

784
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,720
Happy?

785
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,600
I meant this.

786
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,520
I'll go back first.

787
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,360
Go back.

788
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,760
Dad.

789
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,120
You're back.

790
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,880
Dad.

791
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,080
It's so late now.

792
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,200
Why aren't you sleeping?

793
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,160
Where's my mom?

794
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,160
Your mom's not feeling so well.

795
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,280
She had some medicine. She's resting.

796
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Sorry for getting you involved.

797
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,440
I didn't handle

798
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,240
this problem well.

799
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,880
How is this your fault?

800
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,880
Wang Ze Yang asked for it himself.

801
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,800
Even I didn't foresee him

802
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,320
turning into someone like this.

803
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,440
Let alone you.

804
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,440
We learn from our experience.

805
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,280
Keep this in mind in the future.

806
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,520
Okay.

807
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,960
Go sleep, Dad. It's late.

808
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,320
You sleep early too.

809
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,760
There's no work tomorrow, right?

810
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,640
No.

811
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,960
But tomorrow morning,

812
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
I have to go out early to do some stuff.

813
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,920
Don't wait

814
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,880
for me to have breakfast.

815
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,720
What a busy person!

816
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,560
I'll go rest now then.

817
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,560
Good night!

818
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,440
Aren't I just

819
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,720
the so-called 'phoenix man'?
(*Lit.: A self-made man with a humble origin)

820
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
I can't rise again anyway.

821
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Let's die together.

822
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:09,492
[County Government Market: Yanghe Spirit Classic]

823
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,640
Auntie.

824
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,160
Fang. What brought you here?

825
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,600
Here. Have a seat.

826
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,000
Here. Come on.

827
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,120
Here. Sit.

828
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,920
You haven't eaten, right?

829
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
I will cook you something.

830
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,960
Auntie, it's okay.

831
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,920
I have eaten.

832
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,720
I stopped by to visit you on the way.

833
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,600
I just wanted to ask

834
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,520
how you are recently?

835
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm good.

836
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,040
Fang...

837
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
About you and Ze Yang,

838
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,240
I know everything.

839
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,240
It's all his fault.

840
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,880
That stupid kid.

841
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,640
Fang.

842
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,360
From the bottom of my heart,

843
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm really sorry.

844
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,320
Auntie.

845
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,800
You don't have to apologize to me.

846
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,440
It's not your fault.

847
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Plus, this happened

848
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,800
a long time ago.

849
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,040
I've put it behind me.

850
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,400
I really only stopped by to

851
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,520
check on your condition.

852
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
Because I heard that Wang Ze Yang

853
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
has been running into

854
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,800
multiple debts recently.

855
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,120
It's all his second younger brother's debt.

856
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,480
He likes to gamble.

857
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,800
The amount he owed plus the rolling interest,

858
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,120
it's bottomless.

859
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,760
And he ran away.

860
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,280
The loan sharks can only look for Ze Yang.

861
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,880
Our lives now

862
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,000
are much worse than before.

863
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,560
Even his sister's tuition fee,

864
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
we can't afford it.

-President Song.
-President Song.

866
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,320
Hello, President Song.

867
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,240
Hello, boss.

868
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,640
Auntie, it's okay.

869
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,080
Safe trip.

Okay. Please take care.

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,840
There are a few contracts

873
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,560
that need your signature.

874
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,760

What is today's schedule?

877
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,880
Mainly, there are a few projects that

878
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,760
I need to check with you.

879
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
People in charge of each project

880
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,640
have arrived.

881
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,120
Can we set the meeting at 10 o'clock?

882
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,520
Sure.

883
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,800
Are your teeth real?

884
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,720
Yes, they are.

885
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,840
Let me have a look.

886
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,440
Boss.

887
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,640
Why are you

888
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,360
so happy today?

889
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Isn't it good to be happy?

890
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,560
Is it the effect of love?

891
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,080
Love makes people happy,

892
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,240
but you can't understand.

893
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,760
Then, you continue to be happy.

894
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,960
I'll go out first.

895
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,960
See you later.

896
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
You're really okay, right?

897
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,680
Do you want to sit with me again?

who give feedbacks,

903
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,960
for instance, they want to

904
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,760
return the item or so on,

905
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,440
we must accept

906
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,320

My mom told me everything.

I want to thank you.

916

You don't get me wrong either.

The one I'm helping is your mom.

Auntie is nice to me.

She's also a good person.
