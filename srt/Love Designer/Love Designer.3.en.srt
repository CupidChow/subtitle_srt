You also have to take account of

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
I gave a few comments

178
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
and she was unhappy.

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,600
Look.

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
Take a look at the dress.

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,160
It's so ugly.

182
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,600
How can you expect me to wear it?

183
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,960
Min,

184
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
which ignorant person

185
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,880
got on my wife's nerves again?

186
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
I have a guest here.

187
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
Why don't you go out first?

188
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,960
And I'll

189
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,280
think of a way to fix it later.

190
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,920
Okay?

191
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,720
Be good.

192
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,400
Mrs. Qi,

193
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,560
if you don't mind me asking,

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
are you attending a formal dinner?

195
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,840
Yeah, sort of.

196
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
What 'sort of'?

197
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,680
It is a formal dinner.

198
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,840
Yes, indeed.

199
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,840
Here is the thing.

200
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,040
We initially

201
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
planned to have

202
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,280
a wedding anniversary party.

203
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,920
When exactly

204
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
are you having dinner?

205
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
At the end of this month.

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,280
There would be

207
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,120
many of our old classmates

208
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
and acquaintances by then.

209
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,600
So, of course,

210
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
I would need to dress up.

211
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,920
But take a look at the dress.

212
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,880
It's so bland.

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
It cannot show my figure at all.

214
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,440
It's like

215
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,560
wearing a sack

216
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,160
This is embarrassing.

217
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Mrs. Qi,

218
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
here's a design sketch.

219
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Please have a look.

220
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,960
This dress

221
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,360
incorporated the embroidery

222
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
of the finest beads.

223
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,560
It has a very elegant cut

224
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,480
but nothing exaggerating,

225
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,520
bringing out

226
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,600
the grace of the wearer.

227
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,120
What do you think

228
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,880
about this kind of dress?

229
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,120
This...

230
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
It looks pretty nice,

231
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,360
but would it fit nicely

232
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
once it is made?

233
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,880
Actually, the fit

234
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,720
of a garment

235
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,360
is not only about the size,

236
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,560
but the tailoring

237
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,080
and execution of details as well.

238
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,200
Moreover,

239
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,640
Mrs. Qi, your body proportion

240
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,240
is good.

241
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,760
You will definitely look beautiful

242
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,880
in this dress.

243
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,200
Are you sure you can make it?

244
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,480
If you mess up,

245
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,920
I'll be the one suffering.

246
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,960
What are you talking about?

247
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,160
Don't worry.

248
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
This is my design after all.

249
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I will definitely

250
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,280
give it my best.

251
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,480
Do you like it?

252
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,880
Let's give it a go then.

253
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,800
If

254
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,559
you're able to satisfy my wife,

255
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,720
I'll accept

256
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,520
all the designs

257
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,919
that you brought today.

258
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,159
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

259
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,919
I'll do my best.

260
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,320
Let's go, Zhou Fang.

261
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,080
Come take my measurements.

262
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,600
Sure.

263
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,160
Hello?

264
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,880
Hello, is that Qin Qing?

265
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,600
Who's that?

266
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,960
This is Zuo Yu Lin.

267
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
The one at the bar last time.

268
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
Zuo Yu Lin?

269
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,520
Who's that?

270
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,400
Do you remember Wu San?

271
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,840
Ah, Wu San.

272
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
Hi, Wu San.

273
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,520
What's up?

274
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,800
How have you been recently?

275
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm alright.

276
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,960
That's all?

277
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
If there's nothing, I'm going to hang up.

278
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,080
Wait, wait.

279
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

280
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,800
What are you doing now?

281
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,320
Me...

282
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm at a bar.

283
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
There are so many hot guys tonight,

284
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,120
I might go back late.

285
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
I need to hang up now.

286
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,280
Someone came to drink with me.

287
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,760
Hi.

288
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,520
Hi.

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,280
What a coincidence.

290
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,760
Yeah, indeed.

291
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
What's the matter?

292
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,680
Nothing.

293
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Nothing.

294
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,560
I'll get going then.

295
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Wait!

296
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
So is there any matter at all?

297
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,800
Yes, there is.

298
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,880
What?

299
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
I like you.

300
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,240
I wanna be your boyfriend.

301
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,280
My boyfriend?

302
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Is that how you go after a woman?

303
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
It's like challenging me to a duel.

304
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
I graduated not long ago,

305
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,560
so I didn't have a job.

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
But now I've found one.

307
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,680
In a pretty good company.

308
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm slowly

309
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,160
planning out my future.

310
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,760
That's why I only came to meet you now.

311
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,360
What company?

312
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,880
Debt collection company?

313
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,960
This is just

314
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,920
a small hiccup.

315
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm working in the marketing department of

316
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
an e-commerce company.

317
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,640
Qin Qing,

318
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
I know my decision now

319
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,360
is a bit rash.

320
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,080
But...

321
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,000
But I didn't want to let you slip away.

322
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,520
From the day I left until now,

323
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
I've been missing you every day.

324
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
I also thought that

325
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
if I have the right to go after you,

326
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
since I'm such a normal person.

327
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,880
Even the simplest thing like

328
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,480
buying a bag that you like.

329
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,720
I might have to save up

330
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,600
a few months of salary

331
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
to buy it.

332
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,240
You love to travel.

333
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
But I might only have

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
10-day leave every year

335
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,000
to go with you.

336
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
But don't worry, Qin Qing.

337
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,720
I will work hard

338
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,120
and be the man that deserves you.

339
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm not sure

340
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,720
whether I can be

341
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,960
an outstanding person,

342
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,920
but I will

343
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,880
do my best

344
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,760
for my own future

345
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,120
and for you.

346
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,800
Are you done?

347
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm done.

348
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,040
How troublesome.

349
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,320
Isn't it just dating?

350
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,560
Did you need to give a speech?

351
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,800
What's so complicated?

352
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,000
Rich or not rich,

353
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
do I need your money?

354
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,880
Do I need you to feed me?

355
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,960
I don't expect

356
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,200
you are a male chauvinist.

357
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,200
I used to think that

358
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
you were pretty alright.

359
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,920
Now you're just annoying.

360
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,480
I go jogging now.

361
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Goodbye.

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,760
Are you available tomorrow?

363
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,240
See you tomorrow!

364
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Miss Fang,

365
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,240
didn't you sleep all night?

366
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,480
I slept for a bit.

367
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,920
By the way,

368
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,680
this is your parcel.

Zhou Fang, you're very talented.

402
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,000
Your talents are wasted these years.

403
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,840
Zhou Fang does deserve the credit,

404
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,560
but I'm the one

405
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
wearing this dress.

406
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,320
Look at me, my bad.

407
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,000
Of course.

408
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,040
I've must have been very lucky

409
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,840
to be able to have

410
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,079
such a beautiful woman as my wife.

411
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,040
This ring looks so pretty.

412
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,040
Is this for me to keep or to borrow?

413
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,000
This is to borrow...

414
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,560
Of course, it's for you to keep.

415
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,440
Mrs. Qi,

416
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,960
this is the diamond platinum collection

417
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,240
that we CRD

418
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,760
customized for you.

419
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,720
The Femme Allure ring.

420
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,560
It suits perfectly for a wedding anniversary.

421
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
The diamond has a cushion cut

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
and is one of the rare colored diamonds.

423
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,720
I purposely

424
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,920
had this made by a craftsman

425
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,000
with 30-year experience.

426
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,240
It compliments

427
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
your aura and status perfectly.

428
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,160
What do you think?

429
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,240
What a sweet talker.

430
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,120
Yes.

431
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
It's our honor.

432
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,920
Mrs. Qi,

433
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,040
do you think

434
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
this dress needs to further adjust?

435
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,360
No, no.

436
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,560
It fits me perfectly

437
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,960
as if I was born with it.

438
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,480
That's great.

439
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,600
Zhou Fang.

440
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,440
We'll use your designs.

441
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,680
I count on you on this batch of order.

442
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
No problem. I'll inform the factory

443
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,240
to resume production now.

444
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:55,760
Good.

445
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
You're a lawyer. You should know better

446
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
weakness doesn't mean innocence.

447
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,920
Plus, Wan Feng Group

448
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,840
is the victim this time.

449
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,400
And you think I'm too harsh.

450
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,440
You're not being professional.

451
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,880
I wasn't accusing you.

452
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,040
I really admire

453
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,720
your attitude

454
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,440
and decision this time.

455
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,040
But from another perspective,

456
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,400
Zhou Fang is tough.

457
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,120
She didn't say anything,

458
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
and focused on raising money for the penalty.

459
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,240
Tough.

460
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,520
When you made mistakes,

461
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,400
you're supposed

462
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,280
to be apologetic.

463
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,400
Right?

464
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,600
Not entirely.

465
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,200
I heard from Qin Qing that

466
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,080
she worked overnight

467
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,160
to make a dress for a client

468
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
to save the order

469
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,080
that was put on halt.

470
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Even after that,

471
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,440
I don't think

472
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
she profited much.

473
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Wait.

474
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,800
She dares to continue a stopped order?

475
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,440
Doesn't she know

476
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,120
why she was sued?

477
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,280
They

478
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,560
only used the original fabrics.

479
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
The designs were their own.

480
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,040
Hard work, right?

481
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,640
These people who plagiarize

482
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,560
have stepped up their game.

483
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,000
They even have design sketches now.

484
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,960
Well, I heard it from someone.

485
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,680
I don't know the details.

486
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
Have a look at this.

487
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,800
We've filtered out

488
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,400
27 fashion companies

489
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,720
that are suspected of

490
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,840
plagiarizing our designs.

491
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,320
How many? 27?

492
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,680
President Song,

493
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,840
you don't feel sorry

494
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,640
for overworking me

495
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,440
at all.

496
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,360
I'm giving you jobs

497
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,080
for you to earn.

498
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,600
You should feel sorry for me.

499
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,800
Fang Fang.

500
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,640
Have a seat.

501
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,240
Oh, my goodness...

502
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,640
You look terrible.

503
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm working through a hard time.

504
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Sorry, Sis,

505
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
for not picking you up.

506
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,600
Let me do it.

507
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,320
Thanks.

508
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,200
That's fine.

509
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,920
Auntie told me everything.

510
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,400
I'm not sure whether it's okay

511
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
for me to ask for your help

512
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,480
during this period.

513
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,600
No problem.

514
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
It's just taking care of Di, isn't it?

515
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:02,920
Yes.

516
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm flying to America

517
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,400
to meet your brother-in-law

518
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,320
in a few days.

519
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,480
This trip

520
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,960
might take a little bit longer.

521
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
But isn't Di

522
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,800
studying in Beijing before?

523
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,240
I'm applying to transfer him now.

524
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,520
To transfer to

525
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,880
Tan Ding Foreign Language Middle School.

526
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,160
You know that

527
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,800
your brother-in-law is always overseas

528
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
and I always have business trips.

529
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,480
I'm doing this

530
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,160
for him to be

531
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,920
closer to you.

532
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,960
So that I can be at ease too.

533
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,680
The school you applied for

534
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,600
is the best one in the city.

535
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,880
Wait until I finish

536
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
this order that I'm working on,

537
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,680
I'll look for a place

538
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,080
that is closer to the school.

539
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Don't trouble yourself.

540
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,160
Just stay at home.

541
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,960
Then, I'd have to go back home often.

542
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,440
Haven't you heard my mom's

543
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,200
matchmaking plan?

544
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,160
At least I can use Di

545
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,600
as my shield.

546
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,000
You...

547
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,520
Not that I want to nag,

548
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
but Auntie is right.

549
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,800
You're not young anymore...

550
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,720
Sis, don't talk anymore. Let's eat.

551
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,960
Anything cravings? Just order.

552
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,000
My treat.

553
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,500
[Tan Ding Foreign Language Middle School]

554
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,960
Students,

555
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,800
there is a new student

556
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,920
transferred to our class.

557
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,800
Let's get to know each other.

558
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,600
Come in.

559
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,960
Introduce yourself.

560
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,720
Hello, my name is Shen Di.

561
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,800
That's all?

562
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,120
What more is there to say?

563
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,440
Fine.

564
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,360
That's the only empty spot.

565
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,440
Sit there.

566
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,720
Okay. Thank you, Madame.

567
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,760
Madame,

568
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,520
I don't need a deskmate.

569
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,880
Song Luo,

570
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,760
this school

571
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
isn't operated by your family.

572
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,440
Go ahead.

573
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,800
Okay, students,

574
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,480
open your textbook

575
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,840
to page 39.

576
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
The sound of your earphones is too loud.

577
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,280
What?

578
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,160
You're disturbing my study.

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,920
Change your seat then.

580
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I didn't ask you to sit here.

581
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,960
No...

582
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,200
What's going on?

583
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Madame, she's listening to music during class

584
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,240
and it's disturbing my learning.

585
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,800
Song Luo,

586
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,240
hand over your cellphone.

587
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,880
This internet age is progressing

588
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,920
too rapidly.

589
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,280
In fact, the Internet is

590
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,200
slowly replacing

591
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,560
offline the real economy.

592
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,760
Sales and promotions

593
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,800
can all be done online.

594
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,280
It's more convenient and quicker.

595
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,760
But the competition is also getting stiffer.

596
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,160
Promotions done via advertorials

597
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,160
or the typical advertisements

598
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,280
are all in the past.

599
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,280
You want to promote through shows?

600
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,080
Through shows,

601
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
but not those

602
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,080
sponsorship advertisements.

603
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
I want to create a show

604
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,840
that is not only entertaining,

605
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,400
but is filled with actual content

606
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,880
and cultural value.

607
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,480
I've known you for years.

608
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,120
Do you know

609
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,640
what I admire most about you?

610
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,720
It's that you're always

611
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
one step ahead of the rest.

612
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,720
What do you think of the idea?

613
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,040
Let's work together.

614
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
Of course, this is a good idea.

615
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,160
You get someone to handle

616
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,080
the online platform.

617
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,040
As for content creation,

618
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,760
we can discuss it together.

619
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,160
Everyone has a role to work on.

620
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,520
Straightforward. Here.

621
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:54,920
Here.

622
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,320
Okay, students,

623
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
we'll stop here for today.

624
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,440
Goodbye.

625
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,400
You...

626
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,680
Here you go.

627
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Thank you.

628
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,160
Don't mind her.

629
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,760
She's always like that.

630
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,760
I'm Lin Xi,

631
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,040
academic monitor of our class.

632
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,240
Hi, I'm Shen Di.

633
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,880
I know you're Shen Di.

634
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,280
You've introduced yourself.

635
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,200
Does she

636
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,440
have any problem?

637
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,800
Her parents passed away
in a car accident

638
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,040
when she was young.

639
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,280
Since young,

640
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,600
she grew up with her elder brother.

641
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,240
That's why she acts weird.

642
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,720
Just don't mind her.

643
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,600
Or should I tell the teacher

644
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
and you can sit with me?

645
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,360
It's okay.

646
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,000
If you have any problems in your study,

647
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,800
you can always ask me.

648
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,040
Study...

649
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,560
I wouldn't need any help

650
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,240
in my study.

651
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,720
Who said you can sit here?

652
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,280
Get up!

653
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,560
Song Luo,

654
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,360
you still haven't handed in

655
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,280
the homework for this week, have you?

656
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,360
I haven't handed in the last week's either.

657
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,880
Tell the teacher then.

658
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,720
You always like

659
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,200
to tattletale.

660
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,480
You...

661
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,360
What you?

662
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,160
People like you

663
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,840
won't survive

664
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,880
more than three episodes in dramas.

665
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,800
Get lost!

666
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm wasting my breath.

667
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,840
What are you looking at?

668
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,880
Change your seat,

669
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,400
understand?

670
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,200
Why should I change my seat?

671
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,560
I'm not used to having a deskmate.

672
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,520
You're disturbing my sleep.

673
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
What are you laughing at?

674
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm warning you.

675
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,600
Change your seat

676
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,320
or I'll get you

677
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,160
to transfer again.

678
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,200
You heard me?

679
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,200
Stop looking!

680
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
Here, Di.

681
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,880
Have a chicken drumstick.

682
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,920
Someone can't have it.

683
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,720
Have all of it.

684
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,480
Here you go.

685
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Mom,

686
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,720
eat some meat.

687
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Except taking care of us,

688
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,840
you have to worry about me.

689
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,880
You must be tired.

690
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
You remember that you have a mother?

691
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,280
How many days have you not come back?

692
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,640
Ru Hui,

693
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,960
you've improved.

694
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
You can be a poet now.

695
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
That was a good rhyme.

696
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,240
Old man,

697
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,160
what's up with you?

698
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,840
What are you doing?

699
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
You're playing a good guy again,

700
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
aren't you?

701
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,520
No, no.

702
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,080
Weren't you anxious

703
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
when she didn't come back?

704
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Even more anxious than I was.

705
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,080
Yes, yes.

706
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,600
Zhou Fang!

707
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,760
You used to

708
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,640
tell us your good news and
hide the bad ones.

709
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,640
What about now?

710
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,720
You don't tell us anything.

711
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,080
I mean

712
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,840
if something had happened to you,

713
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
how worried

714
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,000
would your dad and I be?

715
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,560
Mom,

716
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,360
don't be angry.

717
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,000
Someone's on fire.

718
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,440
I was busy

719
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,600
with the company's work

720
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,240
earlier on.

721
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,960
It takes too much time to
come back and forth.

722
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm not avoiding you.

723
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,560
Don't be angry.

724
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,640
How about this?

725
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,080
When Di has his school holiday,

726
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,720
the four of us

727
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,440
go out and have some fun.

728
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,000
How's that?

729
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,840
You always talk the talk.

730
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Cool down.

731
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,080
Fine. Let's talk about something else.

732
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,040
Di has been at school for the whole day.

733
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,400
Are you tired?

734
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,080
You wouldn't want to hear

735
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,200
your grandaunt keep talking about this.

736
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,040
Old Zhou, what are you doing?

737
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,920
Are you sabotaging?

738
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,640
No.

739
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,080
Mom.

740
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,040
You just love to sabotage.

741
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,480
Mom.

742
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,960
Di,

743
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,480
how are you

744
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,280
in your new school?

745
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,400
Nothing special.

746
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,720
I always transfer school. I'm used to it.

747
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,280
I'm full.

748
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,520
I'll head upstairs.

749
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,880
You haven't finished the drumstick.

750
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,600
It's okay.

751
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,760
What's the matter, dad?

752
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,080
Don't do that again.

753
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,240
Do I have to ask an outsider

754
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,600
to know

755
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,560
the matter of my daughter?

756
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,600
Is it right?

757
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
Sorry, dad.

758
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,160
Take this card for now.

759
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,760
This is a big deal.

760
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,960
How are you going to solve it alone?

761
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
I don't it, dad. Take it back.

762
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,080
Just take it.

763
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,440
No, dad. Keep it.

764
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,840
I've gathered enough money.

765
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,640
How did you get it?

766
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:29,880
Dad,

767
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,520
why don't you go up

768
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,280
and chat with Di?

769
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,040
He looks a bit off

770
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,680
these days.

771
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,880
Don't change the topic.

772
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,080
How did you get the money?

773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,160
I sold my mortgage

774
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,520
and I signed

775
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,280
a new order.

776
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,560
The payment will be collected soon.

777
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,720
You...

778
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,840
I just can't understand

779
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,800
you youngsters.

780
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
You simply sold off your house.

781
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,000
Move back home then.

782
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,720
Don't worry, dad.

783
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,720
I have a place to stay.

784
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,680
Keep your bank card safe.

785
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,840
If mom finds it,

786
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,960
your money might just disappear.

787
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,400
How troublesome would that be?

788
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,080
Keep it.

789
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,240
I'll have a look at Di.

790
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,440
Keep it.

791
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:26,920
President Song,

792
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,440
Zhou Fang came just now.

793
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Why? She doesn't want to pay?

794
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
The exact opposite.

795
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,680
She paid for the penalty.

796
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,040
That was fast.

797
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,320
There's another amount

798
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,360
that needs to

799
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,480
go into your personal bank account.

800
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,280
What's that?

801
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,320
She said she borrowed it from you.

802
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,280
So...

803
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,160
This is your past interactions?

804
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,600
What past interactions?

805
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,400
Ms Xu.

806
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,080
Had a fight?

807
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,580
[Teaching Office]

808
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,280
Song Luo,

809
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,160
how many times have you caused trouble?

810
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,880
Tell me

811
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
what Shen Di did to you?

812
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Di.

813
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,720
Auntie.

814
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
How are you? Are you hurt?

815
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,440
I'm okay.

816
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,120
What okay?

817
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,520
Why are you hiding? Let me have a look.

818
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,760
It's just a small graze.

819
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,880
What small graze? Your skin is peeled off.

820
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,520
And you are?

821
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,960
Hello, Madame.

822
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm his aunt.

823
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Both of his parents are overseas now.

824
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm taking care of him for now.

825
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,400
I remember now.

826
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,760
Shen Di's mother told me about it.

827
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,080
Please take a seat.

828
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
Wait for Song Luo's elder brother to be here

829
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,040
and then, we can discuss.

830
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,760
Elder brother?

831
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,720
Her elder brother

832
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,560
is just another kid.

833
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,440
What would he know?

834
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,440
Excuse me,

835
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,120
please ask your parents

836
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,000
to come.

837
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,880
I don't have.

838
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,800
Don't have?

839
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,440
How did you bully Di?

840
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
I didn't bully him.

841
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,520
If you didn't bully him,

842
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,680
how did he get hurt?

843
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,920
What does that have to do with me?

844
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,680
Ask him yourself!

845
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,160
Ask him myself? I think...

846
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,720
Auntie.

847
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,680
Forget about it. I'm okay.

848
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,760
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

849
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,120
How is this okay?

850
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
He was the one who provoked me first.

851
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,440
Say something.

852
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,760
You're a man

853
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,520
and you're acting pitiful

854
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,240
behind your aunt's back.

855
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,960
Be careful with your words.

856
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,520
Didn't your parents teach you?

857
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,160
Don't dismiss me with your elder brother.

858
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Give me your parents' phone number.

859
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,840
My parents passed away.
There's no phone number.

860
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,480
You're her elder brother?

861
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,600
Yes.

862
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,880
You two know each other?

863
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,600
-Yes.
-Not really.

864
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,880
So do you know each other

865
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,920
or not?

866
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,200
Madame, that's not important.

867
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,920
Let's get straight to the point.

868
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,680
What did Song Luo do again?

869
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,720
Here is the thing.

870
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,680
Shen Di

871
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,840
has just transferred to our school

872
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,040
and is Song Luo's deskmate.

873
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,080
Both of them

874
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,440
got into an argument

875
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,800
because of the seating issue.

876
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,520
Song Luo's friends from outside

877
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,920
got into a clash with Shen Di

878
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,400
because of this.

879
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,040
I didn't ask them to hurt him

880
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,000
but just scare him.

881
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,160
If you didn't ask them to hurt him,

882
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,320
How about his injury?

883
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,200
He hurt himself?

884
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,480
Apologize now.

885
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm not wrong.

886
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,520
I only wanted him to change seats.

887
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,720
What's wrong with that seat?

888
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
I want to be alone,

889
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,680
not bothered by him,

890
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
How about sending you to the moon.

891
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,240
No one is there.

892
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,520
Why don't you go back to Mars?

893
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,720
I'd be less annoyed without you around.

894
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,480
You should know that

895
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,080
without Ms Xu,

896
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,880
you would've been expelled,

897
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,360
instead of acting rude.

898
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,960
Apologize now.

899
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,560
Apologize!

900
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,080
Forget it.

901
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,480
I never

902
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,440
took this seriously anyway.

903
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,480
Madame,

904
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
I'd like to go back with my aunt.

905
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,160
Erm...

906
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,600
Madame,

907
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,480
I'll bring Di

908
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
to the school infirmary.

909
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,480
OK. Go ahead.

910
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,320
So...

911
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,240
I knew something was wrong

912
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,000
yesterday.

913
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,800
Is it because of

914
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,840
the student named Song Luo?

915
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,800
Why don't you

916
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,640
tell me anything?

917
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,640
Auntie,

918
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,480
I feel like a joke

919
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,480
if I talk about

920
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,200
such trivial things.

921
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,280
Do you want to change to another class?

922
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,440
That student

923
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,840
does seem hard to get along with.

924
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,360
I think it's not necessary.

925
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,920
She's just childish.

926
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,960
I won't bother about her.

927
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,600
I'm worried that

928
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,120
she'll pick on you.

929
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,199
Even her elder brother couldn't control her.

930
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,120
What's wrong with her family?

931
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,520
Are her parents not around?

932
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,920
I heard from the other classmate that

933
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,800
Song Luo's parents

934
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,840
passed away a long time ago.

935
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,520
Her elder brother raised her.

936
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,600
Zhou Fang.

937
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Is there anything, President Song?

938
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,120
It was my sister's fault today.

939
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,199
On behalf of her,

940
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,719
I apologize to you and Shen Di.

941
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
Just now in the office,

942
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,760
I might have said something

943
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,719
that hurt

944
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,440
you and your sister.

945
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,120
I should apologize to you too.

946
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,320
Sorry.

947
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,480
It's okay.

948
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,160
I'll get going.

949
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,880
What's this?

950
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,000
This is the money for everything on the island.

951
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,200
Food, accommodation and cellphone.

952
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,800
Is it enough?

953
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,680
Of course. I've calculated multiple times.

954
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,560
More than enough.

955
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,360
Really?

956
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,120
Why? You want to blackmail me?

957
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,840
Yeah.

958
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,880
I realized...

959
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,880
Bullying you is kind of fun.

960
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
Can you cut it out, President Song?

961
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,720
Your sister bullied my nephew

962
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,760
and you're bullying me.

963
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,520
Your family

964
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,200
is picking on

965
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,240
my family.

966
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,760
I've paid you all that I need to.

967
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,960
I've apologized for all that I have to.

968
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,320
Can you and your family please

969
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,000
leave me and my family alone?

970
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,080
Sure.

971
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
Ever since I've known you,

972
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,360
bad news keeps coming.

973
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,120
What a coincidence? Me too.

974
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,040
I'll discipline my sister.

975
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll also discipline my...

976
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,520
I'll also discipline myself

977
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,000
not to bother you anymore.

978
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,480
Good.

979
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
Good. Goodbye.

980
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,280
Goodbye.

981
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,160
Never see you again.

982
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,040
Right. Just a friendly reminder.

983
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,320
When you discipline your sister,

984
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,120
don't be too strict.

985
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,840
It'll have a perverse effect.

986
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
She's like this even when I'm strict.

987
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,640
She'll only be worse if I'm not.

988
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,360
But

989
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,320
does your strictness work?

990
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
You should find problems

991
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,760
of yourself as well.

992
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,440
You asked me out today

993
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,440
to eat with me?

994
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,880
Today,

995
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
I received the first salary

996
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,040
of my life.

997
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,320
So I asked you out

998
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,120
to celebrate.

999
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,480
Sir, may I take your order?

1000
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,160
Sure, thank you.

1001
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,000
You order.

1002
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,400
Have a look at what you like.

1003
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,360
Just order.

1004
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,880
Okay.

1005
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
Since you're so sincere about it,

1006
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,720
I am a bit hungry now.

1007
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,800
Let's see what is good.

1008
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,920
Two serves of lobster sashimi.

1009
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,360
Yes.

1010
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,560
Two Fo Tiao Qiang*.
(*Lit.: Buddha's Temptation)

1011
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes.

1012
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,800
Do you eat sea cucumber, abalone,
and shark fin?

1013
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,080
Yes. I can eat anything.

1014
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,160
Okay. Two of that.

1015
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,600
Yes.

1016
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,160
And the bird's nest soup,

1017
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,240
two serves.

1018
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,960
That should be enough for two.

1019
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,840
You can order later.

1020
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Sure.

1021
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,360
What do you want to drink?

1022
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm fine drinking this.

1023
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,040
Do you have red wine

1024
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,520
from 1982?

1025
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,360
Yes.

1026
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,800
Give me the best one.

1027
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,800
Sure.

1028
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,720
Thank you.

1029
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,680
You're welcome.

1030
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,520
What's going on?

1031
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,560
Fight.

1032
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,280
Fight?

1033
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,600
Pleased to work with you.

1034
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,800
Thank you President Du for your trust.

1035
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,160
Wang Ze Yang!

1036
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,440
Qin Qing?

1037
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,760
Why are you here?

1038
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,800
It really is you.

1039
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,000
I thought I had

1040
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,840
the wrong person.

1041
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,400
Aren't you in jail

1042
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,560
for fraud?

1043
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,640
Why...

1044
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,840
You're released already?

1045
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,880
No...Qin Qing...

1046
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

1047
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Jokes aside,

1048
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,800
you can't discredit me.

1049
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,040
I'm discrediting you?

1050
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,160
If that's the case,

1051
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,000
you can sue me for defamation.

1052
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,480
You, on the other hand...

1053
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,240
Why don't you tell them

1054
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,160
about the business scandals

1055
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,680
you've done

1056
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,840
for the past few years?

1057
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,960
Let's see whether that

1058
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,840
will keep you in jail

1059
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,920
for the next eight to ten years.

1060
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,320
No...You...

1061
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,080
President Wang,

1062
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,000
what's going on?

1063
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,280
President Du, here is the thing.

1064
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,280
This is my friend

1065
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,600
and we have a slight misunderstanding.

1066
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,840
Why don't you get some rest

1067
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,800
and I'll explain it to you later.

1068
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,400
If you don't want to be cheated,

1069
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,040
don't work with him.

1070
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,440
He lied to his partners

1071
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,520
and ran away with the money.

1072
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,200
He even cheated

1073
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,360
his own fiancée.

1074
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,920
Wang Ze Yang,

1075
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,920
did you really think

1076
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,680
you'll be safe

1077
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,520
just by hiding?

1078
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,200
You were the one behind

1079
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
the design plagiarism.

1080
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,160
How dare you

1081
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,400
let someone else take the blame?

1082
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,360
Where is your conscience?

1083
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,920
Qin Qing!

1084
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,240
What are you blabbering about?

1085
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,400
This is an important client.

1086
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
Our company operates on

1087
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,840
strict protocols and regulations.

1088
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,560
Don't worry.

1089
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,560
I have

1090
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,640
tons of proofs.

1091
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,920
You're not sued yet

1092
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,480
because Zhou Fang is soft-hearted.

1093
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,360
After all, you two were

1094
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
in a relationship for a long time.

1095
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,880
Even if you're a scumbag,

1096
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,840
she accepted the fact as it is.

1097
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,560
I don't understand

1098
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,680
what you have

1099
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,440
to attract her?

1100
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,960
Even the third wheel showed up

1101
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
and she still didn't hold a grudge.

1102
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,400
No...

1103
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,000
President Wang, how about this?

1104
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,360
You settle your problems first.

1105
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,360
As for our agreement,

1106
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,840
we'll discuss it some other time. Okay?

1107
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,640
President Du...

1108
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,080
President Du, let me explain.

1109
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,440
President Du...

1110
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
She's not done yet.

1111
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,640
Happy now?

1112
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,240
Happy now?

1113
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,640
I'm just starting.

1114
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
What just starting?

1115
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,480
You're just a shrew!

1116
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,200
You know that?!

1117
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,000
Say it again if you dare.

1118
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,720
You slapped me?

1119
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,720
You dare to slap me?

1120
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,120
You...

1121
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,160
What are you doing?

1122
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,720
You've found a help.

1123
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,520
Fine.

1124
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,960
I won't fight women.

1125
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,720
I'm calling the police.

1126
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,680
Don't you leave.

1127
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,600
You dare to slap me.

1128
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,400
Calling the police?

1129
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,720
Call the police now.

1130
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,280
Let's go

1131
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
and settle everything there.

1132
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
Be a man and call the police.

1133
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,800
I...

1134
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,600
My phone ran out of battery.

1135
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,680
Otherwise, I would've called.

1136
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,440
Let me tell you,

1137
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,920
watch your backs.

1138
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,360
Mad dogs.

1139
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,480
Wu San, don't let him leave.

1140
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,080
You see.

1141
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,560
Jing Wen had only just passed

1142
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,640
the child to our care.

1143
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,600
How did this happen?

1144
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,680
Worst case scenario, we transfer school.

1145
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,520
Those kids

1146
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,800
aren't the ones

1147
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,680
who would listen

1148
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,960
to your advice.

1149
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,920
We've only just settled the admission

1150
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,040
and we're transferring again?

1151
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,160
This is the best private school

1152
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,080
in the city.

1153
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,280
We don't have to worry

1154
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,640
about Di's study and grades.

1155
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,440
We should be concerned about

1156
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,360
his safety. That's the most important.

1157
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,400
Why don't we see

1158
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,760
how it goes for the next days?

1159
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,440
I think that deskmate of his

1160
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,200
won't do

1161
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,440
anything reckless.

1162
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,000
You don't even know her.

1163
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,640
How can you be so sure?

1164
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:04,966
[Qin Qing]

1165
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,200
Hello?

1166
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,720
Huh?

1167
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,640
Okay, noted.

1168
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,040
What happened?

1169
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,720
Something came up with Qin Qing.

1170
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,480
I need to head over now.

1171
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,360
Sleep early.

1172
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,920
Don't rush. Be careful.

1173
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,400
Okay.

1174
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
Tomorrow,

1175
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,680
remember to come back for dinner!

1176
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,640
Okay.

1177
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,200
What happened?

1178
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,480
Where's Wu San?

1179
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,840
He's keeping an eye on Wang Ze Yang.

1180
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,440
Why did you bring him here?

1181
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,760
He is a sly fellow.

1182
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,080
He's hard to spot.

1183
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,080
After that,

1184
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
I followed him wherever he went.

1185
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,280
He had enough of me

1186
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,040
and said

1187
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,600
he wanted to talk to you.

1188
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
So I brought him over.

1189
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,920
I'll go in.

1190
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,320
