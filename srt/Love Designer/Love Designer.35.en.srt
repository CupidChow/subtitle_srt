00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
meet Ms Tian.

177
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
Why didn't I think of that?

178
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
He dared to lie to me.

179
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,840
Maybe he wasn't lying.

180
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
Maybe he was just hiding it from you.

181
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,600
Hiding is lying.

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm so angry.

183
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Don't be angry.

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,600
Here you go.

185
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Drink some dietary fiber

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,200
to replenish.

187
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,680
Here you go.

188
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,080
You gave me a scare.

189
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,400
Your luck is so bad.

190
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,240
Here, Mom.

191
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm so angry.

192
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,480
That girl! Who didn't know her?

193
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,320
When she was in high school,

194
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,960
she was infamous in the school.

195
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,840
At night,

196
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
she even climbed over the wall to go out.

197
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Why would you like

198
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,280
a girl like her?

199
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
Mom, all those were

200
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,320
immature acts when she was young.

201
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,680
She's changed now.

202
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,320
Lin Lin.

203
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Mom isn't

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
someone unreasonable.

205
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,040
Mom wants to communicate with you

206
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,240
and hear your thoughts.

207
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
But you've just stepped into society.

208
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,400
You're too young and childish.

209
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,480
Mom can't just sit back and

210
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
watch you go down the wrong path.

211
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,240
You and Qin Qing

212
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,200
are not the same kind of people.

213
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
In terms of personality

214
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,320
or value,

215
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,360
you two are different.

216
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,400
Do you understand?

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,960
And you even thought of

218
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,360
making up so many good words

219
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
to compliment her.

220
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,480
Tell me which of those strong points

221
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,160
fit her.

222
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Mom, I'm telling the truth.

223
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,200
You don't understand how she is like now.

224
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,080
We have thought carefully

225
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
about our future together.

226
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,559
We're neither acting on impulse

227
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,920
nor just for fun.

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
You want to make me angry, don't you?

229
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,880
Mom, can't we

230
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,000
discuss it?

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,320
There's nothing to be discussed.

232
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,480
I will definitely not allow

233
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,520
you and her to be together.

234
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,480
Break up with her now!

235
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,440
Don't ever see her again!

236
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
Do you hear me?

237
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,720
Why did you

238
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
lie to me?

239
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,480
What's wrong with you?

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,640
No, Sweetheart.

241
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,400
I didn't want to hide it from you either.

242
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,320
But if I had

243
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
told you

244
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,720
who my mom was from the start,
you might...

245
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't be angry.

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
Why don't you hit me?

247
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,880
Will it get better if I hit you?

248
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,520
If it will, I'll hit you.

249
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
Did your mom

250
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,640
ask you to

251
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,400
break up with me?

252
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
Don't worry.

253
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,480
Although I usually

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
listen to my mom,

255
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm not a mama's boy.

256
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,760
I have my own judgements.

257
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
So your mom

258
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
did ask you to break up with me?

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,240
What did she say?

260
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,160
She didn't say much.

261
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
She just mentioned

262
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,440
the rivalry between the two of you back then.

263
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
But I knew these things,

264
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,160
all along.

265
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
You did?

266
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,760
When I was in middle school,

267
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,240
and went to find my mom
in the high school section,

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
I saw you.

269
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
I've been fond of you then.

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,200
What?

271
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,480
But at the time,

272
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
everyone mingled within

273
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
their own academic year group.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,480
Not to mention

275
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
we were a few academic years apart.

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
How would you have

277
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
noticed a kid like me?

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,960
Then why didn't you

279
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,920
tell me earlier?

280
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
I told you.

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,040
Do you remember the day you and

282
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Miss Fang crashed our party?

283
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,800
I told you that I knew you.

284
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,880
You didn't believe me.

285
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,400
Did you?

286
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,560
Yes.

287
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,520
You even said that

288
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,120
my way of flirting was old-fashioned.

289
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,520
But after that, I thought

290
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,440
it didn't matter if I told you.

291
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
You didn't remember me anyway.

292
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,360
Qin Qing,

293
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,400
to be able to see you again

294
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,320
after I graduated,

295
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,680
I must be

296
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,600
really lucky.

297
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,400
You don't know that

298
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,480
when I was young,

299
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,720
I went to the high school section
to see you after school.

300
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
I was really happy

301
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,040
every time I saw you.

302
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,120
But after that,

303
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
my mom found out.

304
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
She was scared that I'd get into puppy love,

305
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,840
so she was really strict with me.

306
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
And I didn't have the chance

307
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,120
to go and see you again.

308
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,040
When you graduated,

309
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,000
I even cried at home for a few days.

310
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,440
Wait a minute.

311
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,000
Let me sort this out.

312
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,520
So...

313
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
So when I was in high school,

314
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,840
Ms Tian kept picking on me

315
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,440
because of you?

316
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
I was part of the reason.

317
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,040
But it was mainly because you

318
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,880
didn't study,

319
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,120
were always late, had puppy love,

320
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,800
and even...

321
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,400
Wait.

322
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
I didn't have puppy love.

323
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,960
It's just that I was always out...

324
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Out to play games.

325
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,200
No,

326
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,680
stop mentioning things in the past.

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
How can I be so unlucky?

328
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,200
Finally, I'm in a relationship.

329
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,880
Why must I

330
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
run into Ms Tian?

331
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,640
No...Ms Tian is pretty nice.

332
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,160
For the next few days,

333
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,960
I'll go back and

334
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,760
talk to her.

335
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,920
It should be alright.

336
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,640
If things don't get better,

337
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,040
forget about it.

338
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Forget about it?

339
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,440
You mean to

340
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,480
forget about our relationship?

341
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,560
I can handle my mom.

342
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,840
But can you not

343
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
say these things next time?

344
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,360
You said it.

345
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
You'll handle your mom.

346
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,920
I got it.

347
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,320
It's so cold. I'll go first.

348
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,040
Wait...

349
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,400
I haven't even handled you.

350
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,840
Qin Qing!

351
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,120
What are you doing?

352
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
What are you so happy about?

353
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,120
I miss you.

354
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,880
Of course, I'm happy to see you.

355
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,400
Really?

356
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,560
Let's go.

357
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,760
Let's eat something good.

358
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,920
Okay?

359
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,920
Okay. I'll pick up a call.

360
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,480
Hello, President Su.

361
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,160
Zhou Fang.

362
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
I asked Chief Editor Dai Fei out

363
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,480
for a meal.

364
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
Do you join us?

365
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,920
I'll introduce her to you.

366
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,240
Chief Editor Dai Fei?

367
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,320
Yes.

368
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,800
Two celebrities are coming too,

369
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
who will be helpful for

370
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,200
our TKY Shop.

371
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,280
We can promote

372
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,000
your haute couture line too.

373
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,160
Okay.

374
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,040
Okay. It's decided then.

375
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,480
I'll send you

376
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,160
the address later.

377
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,040
Come at 7 p.m.

378
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,120
Okay.

379
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,720
You have something on?

380
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,520
I'll go and look for Wang He.

381
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,400
He was looking for me.

382
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,080
I'll get going.

383
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,800
Come and have a bottle.

384
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
Why did you come?

385
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,800
Why can't I come?

386
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,360
This is my place.

387
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Now that you're dating,

388
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
you're even busier than

389
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,040
when you had work.

390
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
You have free time to visit me?

391
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,880
Got into a fight?

392
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,120
No.

393
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Jealous?

394
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,960
Who is it?

395
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,200
Which man is so capable that

396
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,720
he can make you, Song Lin, jealous?

397
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm not jealous.

398
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,800
I just regret a little bit.

399
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,040
I shouldn't have

400
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,160
pushed her to Su Yu Shan.

401
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,160
What's their relationship like?

402
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
They're partners.

403
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
But Su Yu Shan...

404
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,280
appreciates her.

405
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,520
Isn't that good?

406
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,880
What are you jealous of?

407
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm not jealous!

408
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,320
You just don't admit it.

409
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,560
You're just too used to

410
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,800
taking control of everything.

411
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,880
Now, Zhou Fang

412
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
is no longer within

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,400
your control.

414
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,920
So, you feel insecure.

415
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,800
Am I right?

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
It's not insecure.

417
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,680
This kind of feeling is...

418
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Frustration.

419
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
I want to protect her,

420
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,280
but she doesn't need it.

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,320
Didn't you admire

422
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
her independent personality?

423
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,120
When both of you are so strong,

424
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
this kind of problems

425
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,760
are bound to happen.

426
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
It's not the same thing.

427
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,440
I am a man. Right?

428
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,800
If your girlfriend,

429
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,000
no matter what happens,

430
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,040
doesn't rely on you,

431
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,000
doesn't depend on you,

432
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,000
how frustrating is that?

433
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,120
To be honest.

434
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,360
I think

435
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,280
it's not that she doesn't

436
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,960
need you completely.

437
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,440
Two people getting together,

438
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
you both being shine in the field

439
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,160
was supposed to be a wonderful thing.

440
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
In this modern society,

441
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
women are becoming more independent.

442
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
This is a challenge for

443
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
men's desire to control.

444
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,720
Okay, okay.

445
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,440
Don't be angry.

446
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,880
Since you like

447
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,600
the kind of woman like Zhou Fang

448
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
and admire her

449
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,480
independent personality,

450
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
you should therefore accept

451
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,560
her independent personality.

452
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,960
Not everyone is like

453
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,160
your bro, me,

454
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,520
who is so obedient to you.

455
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,760
Obedient to me?

456
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,040
Bottoms up then.

457
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,720
The dress I wore at

458
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
the film festival last time

459
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,880
made me looked really fat.

460
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,880
When I came back,

461
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,840
those anti-fan ID's

462
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,640
said that I was...

463
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,920
Old-fashioned, fat and round.

464
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,040
I was so angry.

465
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,440
Miss Dai Fei,

466
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,280
when can you

467
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
get me on your magazine?

468
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
Help me whitewash the title.

469
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,360
My fashion resources

470
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,520
are just very bad.

471
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,880
Let me tell you

472
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,520
still pictures have limited persuasion.

473
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,400
You still have to

474
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,080
put more effort in your styling,

475
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
do some marketing,

476
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,360
and you'll be a fashionista.

477
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,760
Thank you, Miss.

478
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,920
Exactly.

479
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,160
Next time, you can look for Zhou Fang

480
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,000
for your red carpet styling.

481
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
She's doing haute couture now.

482
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,960
President Su, you're flattering me.

483
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,200
Really? That's great.

484
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,200
Miss Zhou,

485
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,600
let's exchange our WeChat accounts later.

486
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,680
Just call me Zhou Fang.

487
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,480
Sure.

488
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Zhou Fang.

489
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,680
So are you going to the fashion show

490
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,400
this time?

491
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm still a

492
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,760
fairly new designer.

493
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,440
So, I haven't received any invitation.

494
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
President Su, look.

495
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
She'll be a huge designer in the future.

496
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,160
Why didn't you arrange it for her?

497
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,360
We'll arrange it.

498
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
We're already arranging it.

499
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,240
We'll arrange.

500
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,680
I know that for your TKY Shop,

501
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,280
from the ready-to-wear garments

502
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,480
to the haute couture,

503
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,480
if you don't go and have a look in Europe,

504
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,720
you won't make it.

505
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,599
You have to see more

506
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,480
learn more,

507
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
and communicate more with

508
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,560
other good designers, right?

509
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,839
You are right.

510
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,400
I can vouch for this.

511
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,800
I remember when I was still

512
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,520
unpopular,

513
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,599
those fashion weeks

514
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,880
would not invite me.

515
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,839
So, I went there

516
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,640
with a group of

517
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,560
photographers,

518
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,079
and sent out press releases when I went back.

519
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,240
They thought that

520
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,880
I was invited.

521
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
Promotion is very important.

522
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
Who knew that the entertainment world

523
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
is the same as the fashion world?

524
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Yeah. In the future,

525
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,960
you should hold your own shows too.

526
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,080
And you have

527
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,960
President Su as your a good resource.

528
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,560
You'll achieve brilliant results.

529
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,360
Am I right?

530
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,440
You are right.

531
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,680
We can go to

532
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,600
the fashion week this time.

533
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
We'll arrange it.

534
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Let's meet in Milan.

535
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Sure. Let's meet in Milan then.

536
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,000
Come.

537
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,120
Come, raise your glasses.

538
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,960
Come.

539
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,560
Cheers.

540
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,040
You drank a lot?

541
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,200
I didn't.

542
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,440
I want to tell you something.

543
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
Su Yu Shan said he would bring me

544
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,640
to Milan Fashion Week.

545
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,200
Go.

546
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,120
Sleep in your room.

547
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,520
I'll carry you. Here.

548
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,520
Sweetheart,

549
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
the meal is ready.

550
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,160
Come over and eat.

551
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,040
Wu San.

552
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,040
Take the facial mask for me.

553
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,040
Open it. Put it on.

554
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,400
Sweetheart.

555
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,680
These days, you've been

556
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,720
using this whitening task,

557
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,320
so your skin looks better.

558
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,120
What do you mean by better?

559
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Fair like the snow, delicate as a flower.

560
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
Such a sweet talker.

561
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,320
It's so nice to have someone serving me.

562
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,080
Here.

563
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,920
You ordered takeouts?

564
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,520
You've cooked,

565
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,480
why would I order takeouts?

566
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,560
Maybe it's the parcel.

567
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,160
I'll go and get it.

568
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,920
Don't tell me it's Ms Tian?

569
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,160
My mom? No way.

570
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,920
Back then in our school,

571
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,880
she was known to be

572
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,560
the Big Four Captors.

573
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
It's not hard to find my place.

574
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,960
So should we open the door?

575
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,200
Open it.

576
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm innocent

577
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,080
and upright.

578
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,720
What am I scared of?

579
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Open it.

580
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,000
Miss Fang, it's you.

581
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,360
What were you doing?
It took you so long to open the door.

582
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,240
Where's Qin Qing?

583
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,280
She...

584
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Was there just now.

585
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,960
Where?

586
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,920
Why are you hiding?

587
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,720
It's you both.

588
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,040
I was scared to death.

589
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,160
I thought it was Ms Tian.

590
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,000
Miss Fang, you have fun.

591
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,600
I have something at the company. I'll get going.

592
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,680
You're going now?

593
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,920
Message me on WeChat.

594
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,320
Okay.

595
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm starving.

596
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,920
Is there anything to eat?

597
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
Wu San has cooked. Let's go.

598
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,160
Let's go.

599
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,880
Take off your coat.

600
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm starving.

601
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,800
Are you going to the fashion week?

602
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
This day has finally come.

603
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
I'll go with you then.

604
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Me too. Me too.

605
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,080
No problem.

606
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Who would've thought that

607
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,360
President Su

608
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,320
was so scheming

609
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,600
towards Wan Feng Group back then,

610
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,240
but with you,

611
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,640
he's like a kind big brother.

612
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,800
Don't tell me he's in love with you?

613
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,360
Hold it.

614
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
He's not in love with me.

615
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,600
He thinks highly of me.

616
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,600
Thus,

617
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,400
I have to

618
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,240
prove myself with my work.

619
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,520
And he's not

620
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,240
a bad person.

621
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,040
He's pretty decent.

622
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,720
He's not a crooked person.

623
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,320
I can be at ease then.

624
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,080
Let's not talk about this.

625
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,640
Are you done with your creation

626
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,400
for the jewelry exhibition?

627
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,880
It was done ages ago.

628
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,120
I am very motivated

629
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,080
and hardworking now, okay?

630
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,240
You can ask Pei Pei.

631
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,440
A few days ago,

632
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,120
I even asked her

633
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,840
to find a team for me

634
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,760
to shoot a promotional video.

635
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,600
Yeah. I can prove.

636
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,520
Oh, yeah. Our trip to Milan this time,

637
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,760
I have a lot of interviews assigned.

638
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
By then, can you two

639
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,080
make time for me?

640
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
A piece of cake.

641
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,120
No problem.

642
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,480
Come.

643
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,440
Here's to our trip to Milan.

644
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,040
Cheers.

645
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,280
To everything

646
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,840
to go smoothly for us. Cheers.

647
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,720
Cheers.

648
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,560
Where's your toast?

649
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,560
To us

650
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,760
fulfilling our dreams. Cheers.

651
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,600
Cheers.

652
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,240
Here.

653
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,160
I'm full, Mom.

654
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,880
Eat more.

655
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,640
I've eaten enough.

656
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,880
Your dad passed away early.

657
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,280
Mom raised you up

658
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,440
on my own.

659
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,120
Now you're all grown up,

660
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,040
have your own thoughts,

661
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,040
you don't listen to Mom anymore.

662
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,840
You think Mom's interfering too much.

663
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,640
Mom, I didn't mean it that way.

664
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,600
Okay then.

665
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,400
Then,

666
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,200
have another piece of meat.

667
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
I'll eat. I'll eat.

668
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,480
Lin Lin.

669
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,880
This weekend, I've asked Auntie Huang

670
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
and her daughter to have a meal.

671
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
You know

672
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Auntie Huang's daughter.

673
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,360
When you two were small,

674
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,040
you both always played together.

675
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,320
Now, the girl is

676
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
pretty and elegant.

677
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,400
She is great.

678
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,320
By then, you can come along.

679
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,240
If you youngsters get together,

680
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,920
you'll definitely have common topics.

681
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,840
Mom,

682
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,200
don't beat around the bush

683
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,400
to introduce a girlfriend to me.

684
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,760
You know that I...

685
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,120
Mom knows.

686
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
You youngsters

687
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
have your own thoughts.

688
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
But as a mother,

689
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
I have to think for you

690
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,600
beforehand.

691
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
You two have different

692
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,280
outlooks on life and values.

693
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,000
You two won't last long.

694
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Mom.

695
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
She's not like what you think

696
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
she is.

697
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
We're determined

698
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,520
to be together.

699
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,680
I'm afraid that you're the one who is determined,

700
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,560
whereas she's just having fun
for the moment.

701
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,880
If you're together with Qin Qing,

702
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
in the future, with financial pressure,

703
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,800
the age difference,

704
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,600
and her temper and personality,

705
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,600
are you sure that

706
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,080
you can really live with her?

707
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,240
A human's lifetime

708
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,160
is neither very long nor very short.

709
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,760
When you realize it,

710
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,120
it'll be too late.

711
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,000
Auntie Huang's daughter

712
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,320
is working at a bank.

713
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,720
Her job stable,

714
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,520
she is pretty

715
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,680
and she also has a good personality.

716
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,960
I just want you two

717
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,040
to have a meal together,

718
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,440
get to know each other.

719
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,080
What's wrong with that?

720
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,720
Lin Lin.

721
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,520
I hope

722
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
you can consider it.

723
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,560
Hello?

724
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,840
Hello, sweetheart.

725
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,440
What's up?

726
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,960
Remember to bring

727
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,880
a few thick clothes.

728
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,600
I think it should be fine.

729
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
A trench coat is enough.

730
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,800
Didn't you say

731
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,760
to travel in Europe

732
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,480
for a long time?

733
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,960
What if the weather gets cold?

734
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,000
You make the point.

735
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,240
Okay. I'll bring thick clothes.

736
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,280
Wu San.

737
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,240
When I'm not around,

738
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
take good care of Coco for me.

739
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,440
No problem.

740
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,880
Sweetheart.

741
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm sorry.

742
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,960
I can't travel and

743
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
have fun with you this time.

744
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,800
Don't say this.

745
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
Get your work done,

746
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,920
and wait for me to come back. Okay?

747
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,440
Love you.

748
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,680
Love you.

749
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,960
That's it for now. I need to pack.

750
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,640
Xiao Fei, I think it can

751
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,680
be more precise here.

752
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay.

753
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
And the detail here.

754
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,800
Sure.

755
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,960
What are you two doing?

756
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,880
Lin, it's good that you're here.

757
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,720
There's a surprise for you.

758
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,880
Surprise? There's a breakthrough?

759
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,240
According to your advice,

760
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,880
we've upgraded

761
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,760
the product.

762
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,640
We've upgraded the huge hardware

763
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,960
into the cell phone terminal.

764
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Now, our application

765
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,040
can be used directly

766
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,880
on cell phones.

767
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
Although it has still yet

768
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,920
to be debugged to its best condition,

769
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,080
we've managed to overcome

770
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,160
most of the technical difficulties.

771
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,800
Xiao Fei,

772
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,720
let's demonstrate it.

773
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,000
Sure.

774
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,360
The data is out.

775
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,520
Only with a photo?

776
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,760
This is not bad.

777
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,280
How about

778
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,000
the precision?

779
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,560
The accuracy needs further improvement.

780
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,560
But Xiao Fei and the others

781
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,280
have come up with

782
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,960
a new set of calculation.

783
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,400
We'll test it soon.

784
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,760
Yeah.

785
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,760
Technical problems

786
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,320
can be solved.

787
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,440
It's just a matter of time.

788
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,280
Don't worry.

789
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,560
The entire modeling system

790
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,720
is basically set up now.

791
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
The main thing is the sampling

792
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
of the data on the clothes.

793
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,560
It needs a huge number of samples.

794
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,240
The associated haute couture brands have to

795
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,120
give us authorization

796
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,080
to be included in our project.

797
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,800
So from now on,

798
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,920
we need more

799
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,760
business collaboration.

800
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Since this technology

801
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,680
is mature,

802
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,520
the largest problem has been solved.

803
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,280
I guess I'll have to

804
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,720
set up a team for this.

805
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
I won't drink today.

806
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,960
I heard that President Song

807
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,240
is looking for a new office.

808
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,680
Yeah.

809
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,520
I need to recruit new staff.

810
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,040
My current place isn't big enough.

811
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
My personal advice is

812
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,000
you can put

813
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,920
this option on hold first.

814
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,080
Because there's news

815
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
in the market that

816
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,520
President Song's investor

817
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,480
is facing some problems.

818
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,880
So,

819
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,400
the investor will re-evaluate

820
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
your relationship with him.

821
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
After this, you will face

822
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,640
a big problem with your funding.

823
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,480
You've done it.

824
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,800
Is it necessary for you to come

825
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,560
and tell me?

826
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,760
It's necessary.

827
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,320
Very necessary.

828
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
Because I like fair competition.

829
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,280
To give you enough time

830
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,080
to recuperate.

831
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,040
And everything

832
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,880
can be solved.

833
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,800
However,

834
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,800
I hope this won't affect

835
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,880
your relationship with Zhou Fang.

836
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,080
After all,

837
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,680
we just began our collaboration.

838
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,640
Don't worry.

839
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,040
I separate my work well from private interests.

840
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,960
As for my funding matters,

841
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,160
you don't have to worry.

842
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,040
I can still sustain it.

843
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,160
Entrepreneurship

844
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,920
isn't about who is faster.

845
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,520
We need to see

846
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,200
who can last to the end.

847
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,040
Enjoy the drink yourself.

848
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,480
So last time,

849
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,080
the matter that

850
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,280
you wanted to tell me but you didn't

851
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,600
was the matter about Su Yu Shan.

852
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,080
Right?

853
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,640
You two

854
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
are rivals now.

855
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,560
Whether it's to take precaution

856
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,520
or to knock you out,

857
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,800
the way he cut off your funding

858
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,760
was understandable.

859
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,320
I guess he had

860
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,480
planned this a long time ago.

861
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,920
Xiao Fei has obtained a new result

862
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,960
for application development.

863
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,480
I'll send it to you.

864
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,280
Help me take a look.

865
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,640
Forget about it.

866
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,320
Since we are a

867
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,520
shareholder of Wan Feng,

868
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,600
we won't invest

869
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
in your project.

870
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,760
Last time,

871
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,080
I've already made myself clear.

872
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm not asking you to invest.

873
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,080
Didn't you say your insight has

874
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
never been wrong in this industry?

875
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Help me take a look.

876
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Can't you help a friend?

877
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Sorry. I'm late.

878
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,320
Listen up,

879
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,680
if you didn't show up,

880
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,280
I was going to call the police.

881
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
I can't stand for another second.

882
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,880
I was too busy.

883
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,400
The studio was busy up until now.

884
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,640
I finally got to rush here.

885
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,160
My cell phone.

886
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,080
Eat. You're hungry, right?

887
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm starving.

888
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,320
Enjoy the meal.

889
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,280
You ordered

890
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,160
everything I like.

891
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,880
There's a cake too.

892
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,880
I'm so tired.

893
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,680
Let me have a bite of the cake first.

894
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,160
Uhm...

895
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,520
How's the experience store coming along?

896
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Pretty smoothly.

897
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,000
With Su Yu Shan's help,

898
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,600
a lot of things

899
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,880
can be successful

900
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,920
with him as the middleman.

901
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,480
That's good.

902
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,680
I have something to tell you.

903
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,560
Sorry.

904
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:15,920
I need to answer a call.

905
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,480
Go ahead.

906
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,320
Hello?

907
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,440
I've checked the fabrics.

908
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,560
Okay. Sure.

909
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
How is the financing of

910
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
your project going?

911
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,320
Today,

912
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,160
I spoke to

913
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,840
their boss.

914
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,320
This matter is still...

915
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,840
I...

916
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,160
Answer it.

917
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,920
I know.

918
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,600
For the fabrics,

919
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,360
if you've confirmed it,

920
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,400
you can make the decision.

921
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,120
You don't have to

922
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,240
report to me every time.

923
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,640
Okay.

924
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,600
What did you say just now?

925
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Just now, I said...

926
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,480
have a meal first,

927
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,400
then get back to work.

928
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,360
Okay?

929
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,840
Don't work now.

930
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,520
Okay. Very quick.

931
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm done after sending this.

932
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,639
Here.

933
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Put down your phone.

934
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,360
Finish the meal first.

935
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,280
Do it after you finish the meal.

936
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,400
Hurry. The food's getting cold.

937
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,199
But they are

938
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
waiting for my reply.

939
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,920
I can't let them

940
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,000
wait for me.

941
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,320
Please understand.

942
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,480
Fine.

943
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,560
Hurry up.

944
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,800
Finish everything at one go.

945
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,040
After you finish, have your meal.

946
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,480
Okay?

947
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,560
Okay.

948
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,560
You're off work.

949
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,239
Don't they know that?

950
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,840
The employees are

951
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,760
working overtime.

952
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,320
I can't possibly

953
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,199
do nothing.

954
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,000
I should at least

955
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,159
handle these things for them.

956
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,000
Hurry up.

957
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,400
Okay. Done.

958
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
I'm starving.

959
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,040
Finally, I'm done.

960
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,720
Have some of this. It's cold now.

961
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,960
There's something on your mouth.

962
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,560
About the...

963
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,240
The matter with technology financing,

964
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,440
Are you at

965
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
the active side, right?

966
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,920
How can you be active

967
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
in terms of financing?

968
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,400
We're asking money from others, okay?

969
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,320
Everyone who's doing financing...

970
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,720
Answer it.

971
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,440
Didn't I say it last time?

972
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,920
The fabrics can't be delayed anymore.

973
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,000
The orders can't be delayed either.

974
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,080
Hurry and make the sample.

975
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,800
We can't postpone

976
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,840
the new season anymore.

977
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,040
I'll talk to him.

978
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,360
Okay.

979
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,160
I switched it off.

980
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,560
I'll talk after I'm done eating.

981
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,120
Hurry and eat.

982
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,280
You like this.

983
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,160
Potatoes.

984
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,080
You eat. I'm full.

985
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,440
Meat.

986
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,280
You eat.

987
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,000
Pull it down.

988
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,000
You're angry?

989
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
No. I'm just full.

990
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,080
I'll go and get the bill.

991
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm leaving tomorrow.

992
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,080
Do you have anything to say to me?

993
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,880
No.

994
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,880
Are you angry?

995
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,440
I'm a bit busy with work recently.

996
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,760
A lot of stuff is waiting for me to handle.

997
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
I didn't say you can't be busy.

998
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,520
Your work is the most important.

999
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,680
You should know about

1000
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,880
this kind of working pace the most.

1001
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,480
Just because your work

1002
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,560
is more relaxed now,

1003
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,720
you don't

1004
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,520
understand my work now.

1005
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,600
No, I don't. I understand.

1006
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,800
What I'm saying now is

1007
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,680
you have a problem in

1008
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,840
your time management. You get me?

1009
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,640
What can I do?

1010
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,560
Matters come to me

1011
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,200
one after another.

1012
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
I need to reply to them.

1013
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,840
And

1014
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,800
my staff

1015
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,920
is all very efficient,

1016
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,840
I can't have work getting stuck

1017
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,720
because of me.

1018
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,120
You're a fashion designer.

1019
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
But now, you're also

1020
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,120
a boss.

1021
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,360
You can't do everything

1022
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,280
yourself.

1023
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,000
Why do you have a team them?

1024
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,600
Your team is there to help you

1025
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,440
handle those

1026
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,080
trivial and small matters.

1027
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,960
You just have to make the right judgment

1028
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,520
at crucial times.

1029
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,200
My team is made up of newcomers.

1030
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,000
If they can finish

1031
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,320
the work that I assigned to them,

1032
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,560
that's good enough.

1033
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,600
Then I...

1034
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,920
You can't compare

1035
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,840
your professional team

1036
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,080
with my team of newcomers.

1037
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,600
There's nothing to compare.

1038
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
If you don't compare with a professional team,

1039
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,680
who do you compare with?

1040
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,640
With the passersby?

1041
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,880
And let me tell you.

1042
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,000
If the team is unprofessional,

1043
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,960
if the team can't work properly,

1044
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,680
whose problem is it?

1045
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,440
It's not the team's problem.

1046
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,400
It's your problem.

1047
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,840
It's your problem in selecting your team.

1048
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,080
So we're talking about

1049
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,960
my selection problem now,

1050
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
aren't we?

1051
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,440
I'm now talking to you about

1052
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,640
your problem in management.

1053
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
You're a good designer.

1054
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,440
But you don't know about management at all.

1055
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,640
Yes. I'm not

1056
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,720
good at managing.

1057
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
But what can I do?

1058
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,760
Nowadays, all the

1059
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,440
brand designers

1060
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,120
are doing this way.

1061
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,920
We have to come up

1062
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,600
with our products

1063
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,800
and manage staff at the same time.

1064
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,240
What can I do?

1065
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,040
Do I have a choice?

1066
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,320
Why do others have a choice,

1067
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,120
but you don't?

1068
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,320
Everyone's making their own brand.

1069
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,680
Everyone's a designer.

1070
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,840
Why other people

1071
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,680
can make time for other stuff,

1072
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,400
but you can't?

1073
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,680
What are you trying

1074
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,600
to say now, Song Lin?

1075
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,040
I'm trying to tell you the truth.

1076
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,960
From our dinner tonight

1077
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,000
up until now,

1078
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,080
you have kept being angry with me.

1079
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,840
What happened?

1080
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,200
Is it because I neglected you?

1081
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,400
Did you not neglect me?

1082
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,600
I neglected you.

1083
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,040
Sorry. I apologize.

1084
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,880
But what can I do?

1085
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,160
Haven't I always stayed

1086
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,080
by your side?

1087
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,120
And...

1088
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,360
And I'm striving hard for my career.

1089
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,760
Is that wrong?

1090
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,120
Shouldn't I work hard for it?

1091
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,000
When did I ever say that

1092
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,480
it's wrong for you to strive for your career?

1093
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,960
From the start until now,

1094
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,640
when have I not

1095
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
supported your career?

1096
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,160
What I'm saying now is

1097
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,000
your time management is faulty.

1098
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,600
Do you understand?

1099
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,880
Song Lin, why are you

1100
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,080
being like this today?

1101
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,960
When you worked before,

1102
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,000
you didn't tell me anything,

1103
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,840
and hid everything from me.

1104
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,760
Did I say anything?

1105
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,080
Now, you want me to be gentle,

1106
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,480
soft, obedient and docile.

1107
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,440
What kind of a girlfriend

1108
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,640
do you want?

1109
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I showed my true self

1110
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,120
in front of you

1111
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,320
and you don't like it now.

1112
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,720
If you are

1113
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,880
a male chauvinist,

1114
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,480
you want me

1115
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,560
to follow whatever you say,

1116
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,600
to worship

1117
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,680
everything that you say,

1118
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,200
then sorry,

1119
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,040
I don't think I can do it.

1120
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,320
What do you mean?

1121
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,160
Is it because I don't

1122
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,640
have a job now,

1123
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,560
I'm very free every day?

1124
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,400
Is it because you think you're so busy?

1125
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,240
Zhou Fang, what do you mean?

1126
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You have a bit of

1127
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,840
success now.

1128
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
You are very talented.

1129
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,120
No one's denying that.

1130
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,480
It's okay for you to work,

1131
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,440
but you need to have some self-awareness.

1132
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,080
You understand?

1133
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,640
Or else, why is Su Yu Shan

1134
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,360
working with you?

1135
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,720
What does he see in you? Talents?

1136
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,000
Then tell me, what does he see in me?

1137
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
What does he see in you? I'm a man.

1138
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,720
I know better than you.

1139
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,000
What do you know?

1140
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,560
When I collaborated with Su Yu Shan back then,

1141
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,400
I asked you

1142
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,040
whether you mind that

1143
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,640
I work with him?

1144
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,440
You said no.

1145
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,840
You agreed with me. You supported me.

1146
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,200
And now? What's the point of

1147
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,120
saying all these now?

1148
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,080
What do you mean?

1149
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,400
Are you blaming me now?

1150
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Are you blaming me

1151
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,840
for not stopping you

1152
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
from pursuing your dreams?

1153
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
Or are you blaming me

1154
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,240
for not stopping you

1155
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,040
from going to Su Yu Shan?

1156
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,360
So, what do you want now?

1157
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,480
I quit, okay?

1158
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,240
I get off the car, okay?

1159
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,160
I don't want to be here anymore.

1160
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,160
What are you doing?

1161
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,480
Why do you get off the car?

1162
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,520
Why can't I get off the car?

1163
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,600
Leaving you at the side of the road.

1164
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,640
Does that sound right?

1165
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
We can talk when we get back home.
