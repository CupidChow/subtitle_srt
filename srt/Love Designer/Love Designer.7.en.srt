00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
My allergy

347
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,590
towards cats,

348
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,470
is it curable?

349
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,560
This is hard to say.

350
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,070
Allergy can be

351
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,680
spontaneous in a way.

352
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,230
Are you okay?

353
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm okay.

354
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
But I've heard some people said that

355
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,110
if a person hangs around cats

356
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,760
for a period,

357
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,920
he might develop immunity.

358
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,040
Is it true?

359
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm not too sure about that.

360
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,920
But I have heard of

361
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
similar stories.

362
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,000
Then, I'd like to

363
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,800
sign up for membership.

364
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,470
Miss Fang, you're here.

365
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,760
Where's Qin Qing?

366
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,280
Miss Qing hasn't been in a good mood

367
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,160
for the past few days.

368
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,640
Please go in and have a look.

369
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,160
Sure. I'll go in.

370
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,430
Quarreled?

371
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,000
Just leave me alone.

372
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,310
Why hasn't

373
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,110
Wu San find you

374
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,880
for the past few days?

375
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,000
Broke up?

376
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,830
He and I were never together

377
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,680
to begin with.

378
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
No such a thing as breaking up.

379
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,520
If you like him, just be happy together.

380
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,070
Why do you want to make it so complicated?

381
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,520
I don't like him.

382
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,520
He's totally

383
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,760
not my type, okay?

384
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,040
Miss Fang.

385
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,280
Wu San.

386
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,070
What's up with you and Qin Qing?

387
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,520
There's no problem.

388
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,640
Miss Fang, don't worry.

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,640
I will get together with Qin Qing.

390
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,640
Are you alright?

391
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,160
I'm alright?

392
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,590
Miss Fang,

393
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,680
I'll meet you in a few days.

394
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,640
Sure.

395
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,920
That's all for now.

396
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,110
Boss.

397
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,160
You're here again?

398
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,880
I think my condition today

399
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,470
is pretty good.

400
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,520
Give me something strong.

401
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,880
You must really like

402
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,830
this girl.

403
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,680
But

404
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,560
don't force yourself.

405
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,400
I think I can handle it.

406
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,160
Okay.

407
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,350
Pick a cat.

408
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,590
Egg Tart, it tastes good, right?

409
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,470
Have some meat.

410
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,800
Such a good cat.

411
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,160
Boss.

412
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,800
Don't you think

413
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
if I've improved tremendously?

414
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,310
The cats are close with you now.

415
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,830
I think you should give up.

416
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,710
This thing should be done progressively.

417
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,110
You can't rush it.

418
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,160
No, boss.

419
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,310
I'm sure I can do it.

420
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,800
If I don't hurry

421
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,310
and develop my immunity now,

422
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,560
I won't get the chance anymore.

423
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,920
Qin Qing.

424
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,160
What do you think of

425
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
my new designs this season?

426
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,160
This color looks good.

427
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,880
I like it.

428
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,310
Avocado green.

429
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,710
It brings out the skin color.

430
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,470
Hello?

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,070
Yes, I am. What's the matter?

432
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,520
I'll come right away.

433
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,830
What's up?

434
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,830
Anything happened?

435
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,680
Wu San is admitted into a hospital.

436
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,520
Wait. Car keys.

437
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh yeah.

438
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,520
Let's go.

439
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,040
303.

440
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,430
Where is 303?

441
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,470
303 is here.

442
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,040
Here, here.

443
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,520
Are you okay?

444
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,190
I'm okay.

445
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,680
I'm okay.

446
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,680
Are you

447
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,400
out of mind?

448
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,400
Why did you go play with cats?!

449
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,230
Wu San, what were you up to?

450
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,000
It's not like you don't know

451
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,110
that you're allergic to cats.

452
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,880
The doctor exaggerated it.

453
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,950
I'm okay.

454
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,680
I was thinking of

455
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,040
improving my immunity towards cats.

456
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,920
If I cure my allergy,

457
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,470
then

458
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,430
I can give you a surprise.

459
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,070
Do you have common sense?

460
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,230
You can be immune by doing that?

461
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
Who told you that?

462
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,110
Don't get angry.

463
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
I heard that

464
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
if I spend more time with cats,

465
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,470
I'll be immune to them.

466
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,560
You love Coco so much.

467
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,190
If I want to be your boyfriend,

468
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,230
I can't keep being like this.

469
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,830
That's why I...

470
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,520
Enough.

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,950
I'll go out for a while.

472
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,070
You really want to

473
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,920
be my boyfriend so badly?

474
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,520
Only dating, no marriage.

475
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,110
Is that okay?

476
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,160
Okay.

477
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,800
We will date for three months. Okay?

478
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,070
Three months...

479
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,310
Why is it only for three months?

480
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,310
Because I might get tired of you.

481
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,350
Not okay?

482
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,000
O...Okay.

483
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm okay.

484
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,040
Okay.

485
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,310
Okay.

486
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
What do you mean by 'okay'?

487
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,310
You accept me?

488
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,190
Did I succeed in going after you?

489
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,560
What else do you think?

490
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,280
Finally...

491
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,560
What are you doing?

492
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,640
Why are you here?

493
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,950
Why are you here?

494
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,160
My staff fell sick,

495
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,880
so I came to visit.

496
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,880
How about your cold? Feeling better?

497
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,560
I've recovered.

498
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,760
I don't dare to be sick. I'm scared I'll be tortured.

499
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,310
President Song,

500
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,880
why are you here?

501
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,830
You didn't even go to work.

502
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,430
And here you are. Attached.

503
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,110
I...

504
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,110
I had an allergic reaction.

505
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,710
Allergic to love?

506
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,710
Don't tell me

507
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,830
President Song has a strong immunity

508
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,400
to love?

509
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,110
I don't.

510
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,310
But it depends on the person.

511
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,000
How's your immunity

512
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,070
to love?

513
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,280
I'll head off now.

514
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,110
Head off to find love?

515
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,070
I didn't drive here. Give me a lift.

516
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,640
Go, go.

517
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,230
Take care.

518
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,310
What happened?

519
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
What's going on, Wu San?

520
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,800
Suddenly, I...

521
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,310
Suddenly, I can't breathe.

522
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,310
Can't breathe?

523
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,000
Nurse! Nurse!

524
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,000
I think I might need artificial respiration.

525
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,160
Drive.

526
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,470
Why are you sitting at the back?

527
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm not your driver.

528
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,040
Not happy about it?

529
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,520
Hurry, drive.

530
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,560
Sit in the front.

531
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,110
I'll only drive if you sit in the front.

532
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,070
Why are you so troublesome?

533
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,680
How old are you? So childish.

534
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,520
Fasten the safety belt.

535
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,040
Drive.

536
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,350
What's the matter?

537
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,520
Urgent matter.

538
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,070
Today, the staff in charge of our platform

539
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,190
met a few VIPs.

540
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,280
How big are they?

541
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,880
Su Yu Shan of Bai Sai Group.

542
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,400
What are you laughing at?

543
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,190
I laughing because
he's finally showing his claws.

544
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,350
He seems pretty determined

545
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,190
to bear down on me in all aspects this year.

546
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,400
Let me tell you. Su Yu Shan

547
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,350
is simply scared that

548
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,190
you'll use this show

549
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
to broaden your domain.

550
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,470
I appreciate his recognition.

551
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,760
Bai Sai Group

552
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,400
has made it clear.

553
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,190
Name all the conditions and price we want.

554
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,040
The only thing they want

555
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
is the show's

556
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,190
exclusive naming rights.

557
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,950
Don't you know that

558
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,040
we practice excludability against

559
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,880
people of the same business?

560
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,000
Of course, I know.

561
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,040
That's why I rushed to see you,

562
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,640
so that we can

563
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,110
come up with a strategy beforehand.

564
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,230
You are their target.

565
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,070
Fine. I got it.

566
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
What do you mean by that?

567
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,190
You don't want to discuss a strategy?

568
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,110
There's no strategy.

569
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,160
What strategy is there to be discussed?

570
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,160
Lu Na.

571
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,470
Why are you here?

572
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,880
I just wrapped up my filming,

573
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,920
so I came to see you.

574
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,160
Thank you.

575
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,110
Don't put on a sulky face.

576
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,040
You might

577
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,070
need my help.

578
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,430
About this matter,

579
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
she might be of help.

580
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,640
We'll see.

581
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,920
I'll leave first. I have something on.

582
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,950
Are you not bothered?

583
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,680
I have something on.

584
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,070
What did you say in the end?

585
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,160
I told him to leave me alone.

586
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,470
Don't help or make it hard for me.

587
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Nothing good ever

588
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
comes out of his mouth.

589
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,680
But I think

590
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,190
he still cares for you.

591
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,520
Look.

592
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,110
He purposely got you a unit

593
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,230
right opposite his.

594
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,430
And he followed closely

595
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,950
on your application form and your work.

596
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,230
I heard Wu San said that

597
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,400
there were a lot of applicants.

598
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,470
So why did he have to

599
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,040
read your files?

600
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,640
He's obviously into you.

601
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,950
What's up

602
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,800
between you two?

603
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,520
What can there be between us?

604
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,070
I'd rather be in a relationship with this

605
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,350
than with him.

606
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,160
He and I are just neighbors,

607
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,430
normal friends, student's guardians.

608
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,710
Do you

609
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,000
still mind about that...

610
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,760
Lu Na?

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,560
Can you even trust what the media said?

612
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,280
Have a meal and you're a couple,

613
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,710
arm around the waist and you're married,

614
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,190
eat too full and you're pregnant.

615
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,040
Are you even

616
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,070
listening to me?

617
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,230
You keep eating.

618
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,760
It's good.

619
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,710
Anyway, whenever I see him,

620
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,830
I just want to quarrel with him.

621
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,920
Every time we meet,

622
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,950
we would argue.

623
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,000
If I get together

624
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,590
with this kind of person,

625
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,470
my future

626
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,830
will be chaotic.

627
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,590
You two argue every day,

628
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,000
but you still meet every day.

629
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,040
But I have to remind you.

630
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,920
A man like Song Lin,

631
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,350
who naturally beckons women,

632
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,830
is generally wilder than how he looks.

633
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,400
Plus, they can't settle down.

634
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,950
This kind of men

635
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,070
is fine as boyfriends,

636
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,640
but not as husbands.

637
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,160
Don't worry.

638
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,040
I won't

639
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,830
get together with him.

640
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,560
Seriously?

641
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,470
Of course.

642
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,560
Have you seen her before?

643
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,760
Who?

644
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Don't act dumb.

645
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,160
The designer named Zhou Fang.

646
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,110
Have you seen her before?

647
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,470
Yes, I have.

648
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,470
What's going on

649
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,470
between the two of them?

650
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,000
How would I know that?

651
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,070
They were involved in a lawsuit before.

652
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,710
They're not close. Don't worry.

653
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
Normal friends.

654
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,160
Are you sure?

655
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,350
I asked you to keep an eye on Song Lin.

656
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,710
Why is this kind of woman

657
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,760
appearing around him?

658
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm not his dad,

659
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,110
he's not my son.

660
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,160
How am I supposed to control that?

661
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,830
What do you want to do?

662
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
What do I want to do?

663
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,830
Help me then.

664
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,110
I'll think about it.

665
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,470
Enough. Don't overthink it.

666
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,880
Eat as usual, drink as usual.

667
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,520
Trust me.

668
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,160
Just let Song Lin

669
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,070
be free for another two years.

670
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,590
When there comes a day

671
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,520
he decides to settle,

672
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,160
you'll still be there

673
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,920
waiting for him.

674
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,310
He'll definitely marry you

675
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,040
instance.

676
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,040
Do you trust me?

677
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,190
Are you sure?

678
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,350
What if...

679
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,230
What if I didn't get him

680
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,350
in the end?

681
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
If you didn't get him,

682
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,830
I'll be your safety net.

683
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,920
I'll marry you.

684
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,070
Go away.

685
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,470
No sense of humor at all.

686
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,230
Handsome guy, let's have a drink.

687
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,590
I see you've finished entertaining your goddess.

688
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,190
When do you...

689
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,000
plan to tell her?

690
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,230
Tell what?

691
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,160
Tell her that I have a crush on her for ten years?

692
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,230
Yeah.

693
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,230
Look at what food

694
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,680
I've brought you.

695
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,760
I don't even have to guess.

696
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,920
Were you thinking of buying anything else?

697
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,710
This food is seriously good.

698
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,470
Regarding the matter with Su Yu Shan,

699
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
Lu Na will definitely help you.

700
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,470
It's not easy to invite a female celebrity

701
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,470
who's as popular and good at acting

702
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,470
as her.

703
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,560
The price is high, the schedule is full.

704
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,310
Plus,

705
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,310
Lu Na already said that

706
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,710
for you,

707
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,470
she will definitely

708
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,350
appear in our show.

709
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,110
They will surely

710
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,230
take account of this factor.

711
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,000
Therefore,

712
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,920
it's about time

713
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,760
that we

714
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
show them

715
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,920
our ace, Lu Na.

716
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,160
I'm talking to you.

717
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,350
Think about it.

718
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:46,950
I'll think.

719
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,680
She already said that

720
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
no matter what you need,

721
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,350
just let her know,

722
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,310
and she'll help you out.

723
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,920
What are her conditions?

724
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,800
What do you think?

725
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,190
What are you looking at? A pretty lady?

726
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,040
Nothing.

727
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,280
Zhou Fang lives there.

728
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,080
It can't be.

729
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,080
Really?

730
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,150
Lu Na was right.

731
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,520
Are you in a relationship

732
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,430
with Zhou Fang?

733
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,040
What relationship?

734
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,150
When do you think it is?

735
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,560
It's one-sided.

736
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,280
Put a sock in it.

737
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,840
You think I don't know you?

738
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,760
You're not that pure and innocent.

739
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,520
Don't try to

740
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,230
improve your image

741
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,390
with these cheap tactics.

742
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,080
You're not going after her?

743
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,230
Why should I?

744
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,040
This type of feeling

745
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,560
comes and goes.

746
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,280
Plus, if you like someone,

747
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,360
it doesn't mean to be together.

748
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Just like you.

749
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,600
You can't trust this type of feeling.

750
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,190
This is karma.

751
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,320
You'll forever be a bachelor.

752
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,430
You're still single now.

753
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,320
Where's your girlfriend?

754
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,360
Me?

755
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,870
I always get into trouble for talking too much.

756
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,760
Hello? Have you found out?

757
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,120
Did Zhou Fang move there?

758
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,190
Yes, she moved here.

759
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,390
I just came out of Song Lin's house.

760
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,670
Okay. I got it.

761
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
Why did you look for me?

762
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,040
You should know

763
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,320
why I looked for you, don't you?

764
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,280
No, I don't.

765
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,000
Are you

766
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,280
renting Song Lin's house?

767
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,670
Yes.

768
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,800
Do you know that

769
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm his girlfriend?

770
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,520
You're meeting frequently in private

771
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
with someone who has a girlfriend.

772
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,670
You even moved into his house.

773
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,560
What should I think of this?

774
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,150
Song Lin told me before

775
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,390
that you two are work partners.

776
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,360
He told you that?

777
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Of course.

778
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,670
You actually believe what he told you?

779
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,000
Do you know

780
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
whether he's telling the truth?

781
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,800
You don't understand him.

782
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
Whether or not it's the truth,

783
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,040
I have never

784
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,120
crossed the line with Song Lin.

785
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,280
You don't have to worry about this.

786
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,630
But your existence

787
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,630
has already affected us.

788
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,560
Do you understand that?

789
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,760
I didn't

790
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,630
think much about it before.

791
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,710
But now I think

792
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,520
I might have not

793
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,190
considered things thoroughly.

794
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,470
I didn't pay attention

795
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,430
to keeping a distance.

796
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,760
If this matter

797
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,840
really has affected you,

798
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,560
I apologize.

799
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
But I have absolutely no motives

800
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,470
towards Mr Song Lin.

801
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,040
And I've never thought of

802
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
ruining other people's relationship.

803
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,760
If you don't wish to

804
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,950
ruin other people's relationship,

805
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,000
within three days,

806
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,630
move out of Song Lin's house.

807
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,040
The rent that you lost,

808
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,150
I'll compensate you.

809
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,600
You don't have to.

810
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,670
Don't act tough.

811
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,630
I understand fully

812
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,040
about your financial situation.

813
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,120
Don't make things

814
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,150
hard for yourself.

815
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,470
You might have understood

816
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,360
my financial situation,

817
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,760
but you don't understand me.

818
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,390
I won't take the money

819
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,320
that I didn't earn.

820
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,280
Goodbye.

821
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,630
Who is it?

822
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,320
Why are you here?

823
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,120
My brother isn't cooking today.

824
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,280
He asked me to come and find you.

825
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,630
You're eating now!

826
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,520
Just in time.

827
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,320
What are you eating?

828
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,670
Hotpot.

829
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,120
Is there this type of hotpot?

830
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,800
Never seen it before?

831
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,670
You're just picky.

832
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,230
Be grateful that there's something for you to eat.

833
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,120
You want taste and nutrition,

834
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,950
this is the best choice.

835
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,080
After all, there is nothing left

836
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,120
in our fridge now.

837
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,040
Eat now. It's boiling.

838
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,280
Not bad.

839
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,600
You can take spicy, right?

840
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,230
What flavor is this? It's so good!

841
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,150
It's good, right?

842
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,150
If there's nothing on,

843
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,870
how about I come over often

844
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,470
to have a meal?

845
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,430
It's just another pair of chopsticks.

846
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,280
We'll see.

847
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,670
Stingy.

848
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,470
Having hotpot?

849
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,430
Come, join us. It's just started to boil.

850
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,000
It smells nice.

851
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,120
Who asked you to come?

852
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,150
I came to pick Luo Luo up. What's wrong?

853
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,600
You should go back.

854
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,800
You should go back.

855
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,600
What do you mean?

856
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,630
This is my home.

857
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,760
Let's go back then.

858
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,120
Let's go back.

859
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,430
Fine.

860
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,560
Eat.

861
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,560
I'll go back now.

862
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,230
Luo Luo,

863
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,870
come back when you finish eating.

864
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,870
Okay.

865
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,320
If

866
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,630
you can't finish it,

867
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,520
bring some soup back.

868
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,280
I haven't eaten either.

869
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,630
I'll go now.

870
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,230
And I've never thought of

871
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,430
ruining other people's relationship.

872
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,320
If you don't wish to

873
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,360
ruin other people's relationship,

874
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,360
within three days,

875
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,950
move out of Song Lin's house.

876
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,380
[Numerous house resources]

877
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,710
Hello.

878
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,470
Miss,

879
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,470
didn't you just move in?

880
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,190
Something happened

881
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,230
and I want to move out.

882
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,430
Didn't I pay

883
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,630
one-year rent?

884
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,600
I've only stayed here

885
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,430
for less than a month.

886
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,670
So I was thinking,

887
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,950
if I sublet it out,

888
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,800
would the loss be

889
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,630
slightly less?

890
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,630
Miss, it is

891
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,360
written clearly in our contract that

892
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,360
no subletting is allowed.

893
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,360
If you want to sublet the unit,

894
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,430
you must obtain permission from the landlord.

895
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,230
How about

896
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,840
I go and ask

897
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,560
the landlord?

898
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,280
Never mind, never mind.

899
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,390
I won't sublet it for now.

900
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,670
Then, your rent for a year...

901
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,800
It's okay, it's okay.

902
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,560
I won't sublet it.

903
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,000
Let me think about it.

904
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,520
Okay, bye.

905
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,520
What are you planning now?

906
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,760
I'm just tidying up. Do some exercise.

907
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,040
Why are you moving out?

908
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,560
Who's moving?

909
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,760
Why are you moving out?

910
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,230
I don't want to stay there anymore.

911
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,360
Why?

912
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,280
No reason.

913
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,150
Have you met Lu Na?

914
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,150
No.

915
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,040
You

916
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,870
have a girlfriend,

917
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,840
can you keep a distance

918
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,710
with other women in the future,

919
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,870
just to avoid any misunderstanding?

920
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,390
She said she's my girlfriend?

921
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,320
And I say she's not.

922
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Do you believe her or me?

923
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,150
Zhou Fang...

924
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,390
Ever since you and Di moved over,

925
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,630
Luo Luo has been very happy.

926
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,230
If you move out,

927
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,800
I wouldn't know how to tell her.

928
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,000
Plus, I've been

929
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,710
busy with work recently.

930
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,710
I don't have time to look after her.

931
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,230
Don't move out and stay

932
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,000
for now?

933
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,870
Luo Luo needs you.

934
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:05,120
Are you trying to

935
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,190
coerce me morally?

936
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,950
Is it so straightforward?

937
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,120
If there's nothing else,

938
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
please go back.

939
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,150
Then, are you still moving?

940
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,520
I'll think about it.

941
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,630
Think carefully.

942
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,670
Luo Luo needs you.

943
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,520
Luo Luo needs you.

944
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,710
Luo Luo needs you.

945
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,390
