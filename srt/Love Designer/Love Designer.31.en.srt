00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,720
Drive slow.

177
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,760
Sure, sure.

178
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm sorry, Madam Cheng.

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,640
This kid...

180
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
You're awake?

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,920
What is your name?

182
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Zhou Fang.

183
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,280
Good.

184
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,400
Rest well.

185
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
No big movements.

186
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,920
Where is this?

187
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
This is the intensive care unit.

188
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,360
Your condition worsened

189
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
and you went unconscious.

190
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,840
The doctors have performed

191
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,160
emergency treatment,

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
but you still have to stay overnight

193
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
and be monitored tonight.

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Don't worry. Rest well.

195
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,880
It's you.

196
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
I guessed that you hadn't left,

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
so I sneaked out to see you.

198
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,840
Where is Luo Luo?

199
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
I sent her back.

200
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,240
Why didn't you go straight back home?

201
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,200
Why come to the hospital?

202
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,320
You really think I want to come?

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Both of you

204
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,320
are here.

205
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,600
Don't get me wrong.

206
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm only worried about Zhou Fang.

207
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
Fang's situation just now

208
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,440
was pretty scary.

209
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,280
Luckily, she's getting better now.

210
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Don't worry.

211
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Doctor Bai and the rest

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,960
are very professional.

213
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
Luckily, you realized it soon enough.

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,160
Otherwise,

215
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,800
I really can't imagine.

216
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,360
Miss Fang is in the intensive care unit now.

217
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,680
She'll receive the immediate

218
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,720
supervision and treatment.

219
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
Why don't you go back and rest?

220
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,480
You can come

221
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,440
during visiting hours

222
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,080
tomorrow.

If you're really worried,

224
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,760
I'll go and keep an eye for you.

225
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,560
Forget it.

226
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Your condition

227
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,640
isn't any better.

228
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,320
You should go back.

229
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
I'm feeling okay.

Your coat.

It's cold here. You put it on.

Hello? It's me.

How is Zhou Fang now?

Don't worry. Her condition is considered stable.

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
Can you pass her the phone?

241

242
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,840
to rest now.

243

Let's not disturb her.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
True.

245
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Let her rest then.

246
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,880
Thank you.

Be careful when you're driving.

Don't rush.

Okay. Don't worry.

Who am I to you?

Why didn't you tell me that you were sick?

334
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,240
I thought

335
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
before you come back,

336
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,720
I would have recovered.

I couldn't reach you, and couldn't contact you.

340

345

wherever I'm at,

346
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
if you have anything,

347
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,320
you tell me immediately.

00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,360
see me ever again.

350
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,680
Let me have a look.

352
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,760
What are you crying for?

353
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,360
I won't get sick anymore.

355
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,840
Uncomfortable?

356
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,440
Feel okay now?

357
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,080
Don't cry. Lie down.

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,280
Lie down. Come.

359
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't cry. Don't cry.

360
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
You have to tell me next time.

361
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,320
The doctor said your condition

362
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,960
isn't stable yet.

363
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
You might get a fever

364
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,040
at night.

365
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,320
You may be uncomfortable again,

366
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,040
okay?

367
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,040
Eat something.

368
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,840
Don't want to eat?

369
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
How can you get better if you don't eat?

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
I'll get better if you hug me.

371
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,480
You want a hug?

372
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,920
I won't let you hug me.

373
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,360
The taste seems good.

374
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,440
Because you brought it.

375
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,560
Song Lin prepared it.

376
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,440
If there's nothing, I'll get going.

377
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,440
Be careful on the road.

378
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,640
Drive slow.

379
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
If there is any special circumstance,

380
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,640
call me.

381
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
Why did you wake up so early?

382
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
I couldn't sleep.

383
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
Thinking about Zhou Fang?

384
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,360
If you miss her, call her.

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
She might still be sleeping now.

386
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,640
Let her sleep.

387
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,440
I won't disturb her.

388
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
Who knows that having a flu

389
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,400
can lead her to

390
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,040
the intensive care unit (ICU)?

391
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,520
If it was me,

392
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,440
I would've been scared to death.

393
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,920
Even I didn't know that having a flu

394
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,760
would end up in the ICU.

395
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,480
She was very scared.

396
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
Don't worry too much.

397
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,640
Zhou Fang has always been energetic

398
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,560
and strong-hearted.

399
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
She'll definitely get better.

400
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
I wish that

401
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,040
she can get better soon, okay?

402
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,120
You're making porridge for Zhou Fang, right?

403
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,040
I'll scoop it out when it's done.

404
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
Miss Qing,

405
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
that means even if I go to the hospital,

406
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
I won't see Miss Fang.

407
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,480
Yeah.

408
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,360
That's good too.

409
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,000
She can rest and heal quietly.

410
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,000
When her fever go away,

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think she can be discharged.

412
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,600
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,200
Miss Fang is someone who is

414
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
like a cat with nine lives.

415
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
A small illness like this can't take her down.

416
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
Miss Qing, don't worry.

417
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,840
Wu San will be fine too.

418
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,920
When did I worry about him?

419
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,200
But you mentioned about him

420
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,280
a few times just now.

421
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,240
Did I?

422
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,120
Yes, you did.

423
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,040
The way you two talk

424
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
one after another now,

425
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,560
that's some good chemistry.

426
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,200
Don't talk nonsense.

427
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,640
Then...I'm leaving.

428
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,800
Be careful when you

429
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,440
go out nowadays.

430
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,520
Wear your mask.

431
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,200
Only I have to be careful?

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,720
Everyone...Be careful.

433
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,680
I'll go now.

434
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,320
Okay.

435
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,160
Contact via WeChat, okay?

436
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
Why are you so annoying?

437
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,760
I am annoyed.

438
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,920
My dad hasn't recovered yet

439
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,360
and Zhou Fang is sick.

440
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,480
How can I not be annoyed?

441
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,720
But you still have the mood to joke around?

442
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
Asking both of us to come over

443
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,400
at the same time.

444
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,080
Are you unhappy with it?

445
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
If it wasn't for me,

446
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,360
can you meet him?

447
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,680
You should pay more attention

448
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,520
your Wu San.

449
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,280
Don't always have your bark worse than your bite.

450
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
What if something really

451
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,160
happens to him?

452
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,360
It'll be too late for you to regret.

453
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,880
Spit. Spit.

454
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,800
Touch wood.

455
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,080
Spit. Spit.

456
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
Look at you,
still saying you don't care?

457
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm not talking to you.

458
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,760
Hello, mom.

459
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,840
Fang, are you back?

460
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,120
Not yet. Still a few days more.

461
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,200
Didn't you say

462
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,280
it's for one week?

463
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
Don't worry.

464
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,440
As soon as I'm back in Shanghai,

465
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,080
I'll call you

466
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,160
immediately.

467
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,880
You think I don't

468
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
want to go back home now?

469
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,560
Uhm... If you two

470
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,280
are going out,

471
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,600
remember to wear masks.

472
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
Many infectious diseases prevail recently.

473
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,120
I'm worried that you two would fall sick.

474
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,800
How many times have you said it?

475
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
You really think that

476
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,160
I have Alzheimer's disease, don't you?

477
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,920
I'll keep that in mind.

478
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,200
Okay. I'll hang up then.

479
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
Is Zhou Fang getting better now?

480
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,480
Don't even get me started.

481
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,520
The nurse said she couldn't

482
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,280
sleep at all.

483
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,080
She kept having nightmares.

484
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
I brought food for her.

485
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,720
She only took a few bites

486
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,200
and she was full.

487
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
People tend to think a lot

488
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,320
when they're sick.

489
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,360
The more they think, the harder it is to sleep.

490
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
At least I was like that anyway.

491
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,480
But...The way she's

492
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,320
not eating nor sleeping,

493
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,520
even a normal person can't stand it.

494
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,080
You should go to sleep.

495
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,760
I'll visit her at the hospital

496
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,280
later.

497
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,360
It'll be troublesome if her condition

498
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,000
worsens again.

499
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,200
But... At this hour,

500
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,280
you won't get to see her.

501
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,560
As long as I can stay close to her.

502
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
What do you plan to say

503
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,520
if you see her?

504
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,920
Just keep her company.

505
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Do you remember when I was young

506
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,960
and I got sick,

507
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,200
how you cheered me up?

508
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,040
Before everything gets better,

509
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,680
one will have to experience the nights.

510
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,240
It might be long,

511
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,720
or it might be gone when you wake up the next day.

512
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,360
But you don't have to be afraid.

513
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,080
I'm here.

514
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,520
This is

515
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,000
the goodnight radio station, exclusively for

516
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,840
Little Zhou Fang.

517
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,480
Welcome to tune in.

518
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,400
When Luo Luo left home,

519
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,200
she was very young.

520
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,080
She often couldn't sleep at night.

521
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,360
What could I do?

522
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
So, every night,

523
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,520
I would tell her stories.

524
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Every day at 9:30 p.m.

525
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,440
For every single day.

526
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,600
Luo Luo

527
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,040
would listen and slowly fall asleep.

528
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
Sometimes, she would even have a sweet dream.

529
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,040
So,

530
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,800
from now on,

531
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,320
let my voice be

532
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,040
your guardian angel.

533
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,200
No matter how

534
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,240
the future looks like,

535
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
no matter how far the future is,

536
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,680
don't worry, don't be scared.

537
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,320
Because I'll always be here.

538
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,560
I'll always be

539
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,240
by your side.

540
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,280
How are you feeling? Did you sleep well last night?

541
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,000
Pretty well.

542
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm a bit hungry now.

543
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,480
You're hungry?

544
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,840
Then call your boyfriend and

545
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,160
ask him to bring you some food.

546
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,320
Okay.

547
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,040
Check your temperature later.

548
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,720
Okay.

549
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,720
Listen to me.

550
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,960
If you can eat something,

551
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,800
it means you're

552
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,600
recovering.

553
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,720
You didn't sleep much

554
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,240
last night, right?

555
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,000
Do you want to

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,920
go and have a rest later?

557
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,800
Don't bother about me.

558
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,280
How was last night's show?

559
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,920
Are you satisfied?

560
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,520
Who knew your voice

561
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,440
can sound so good?

562
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,560
Have you considered being a voice actor?

563
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,480
Do you have any ideas today?

564
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,520
Anything you want to listen to?

565
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,040
Let me think.

566
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,640
I think

567
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,640
we shouldn't settle with just aural.

568
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Visually,

569
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,120
do you want to do something?

570
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,080
What do you want to see visually?

571
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,160
Enough.

572
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,240
I knew you don't mean good news.

573
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,760
Say it.

574
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,040
Hot hunk's striptease.

575
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,040
No way.

576
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,000
Are you crazy? That's is a hospital.

577
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
Do you want to get me arrested?

578
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,440
Fine.

579
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,160
Enough.

580
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,360
Grab some sleep after you're done eating.

581
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,080
Bye.

582
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,040
Why are you here?

583
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,160
I guess taking care of a patient

584
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,800
is indeed tough.

585
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,440
About what happened last time,

586
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,440
sorry.

587
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm really sorry.

588
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,040
The situation was urgent.

589
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,680
I didn't have a choice...

590
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,920
Enough. Hold it.

591
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,360
Don't get courteous with me.

592
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,800
How is Zhou Fang?

593
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,920
She's much better,

594
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,040
but she's still in the hospital.

595
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,440
By the way,

596
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,720
Last time, you told me not to

597
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,400
tell Qin Qing about the negotiation

598
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,640
being terminated when I see her,

599
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,920
I didn't say anything.

600
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,440
Yeah. Don't tell them.

601
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
You tell Qin Qing

602
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,040
and she tells Zhou Fang.

603
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,320
When Zhou Fang knows it,

604
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
she'll blame herself and get sad.

605
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,040
It's unnecessary.

606
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,280
Let's get down to business.

607
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
With the failed negotiation last time,

608
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,840
you're in a passive position now.

609
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Ling Xi will no longer

610
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,080
proceed with the investment.

611
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,280
Other buyers who were taking
the wait-and-see approach

612
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,480
have begun to speculate.

613
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,480
Their attitudes are ambiguous.

614
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,840
Their intentions are unclear.

615
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,960
I know. It's understandable.

616
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,040
When I left last time,

617
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I knew this was going to happen.

618
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,720
Still, thank you.

619
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,400
You really

620
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,120
helped me a lot this time.

621
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
We'll talk about it again when it happens.

622
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,080
Yeah.

623
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,160
From now on,

624
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,240
only you can help yourself.

625
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,560
But Ling Xi...

626
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,240
I know her.

627
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,960
She's not an unreasonable person.

628
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,480
If she's willing to talk to you,

629
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,200
it means that they

630
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,920
think this deal

631
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
is beneficial for them.

632
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,200
What we need to do now

633
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,080
is to think of an idea

634
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,640
to get them to

635
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,320
continue to consider.

636
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,600
The power of love is so great.

637
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,280
It seems that you'll be out of

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,640
the hospital in another week.

639
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Let's hope so.

640
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,920
These two days,

641
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,080
you didn't visit Wu San again.

642
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,720
You don't know how tormented he feels.

643
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
Just take care of yourself.

644
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,640
Stop worrying about others.

645
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
What do you mean 'others'?

646
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,560
Wu San is not others.

647
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,240
Then I'll make time

648
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,360
to visit him for you.

649
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,040
Is it OK?

650
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,840
You obviously

651
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,760
want to visit him.

652
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
You just don't want to admit it.

653
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,160
I'll hang up. Go to sleep.

This is the progress report of the project.

Please have a look.

Okay. I'll read it when I'm back.

the subsequent investment,

you don't have to worry.

663

I'm in the process of implementing it.

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,080
Thank you, President Song.

665
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,720
With you, we're much at ease.

666
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,600
Recently, everyone has been

667
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,400
working very hard.

I'll give you all a paid leave.

670
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,120
Thank you, President Song.

671
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,800
Get back to work.

672
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,320
Okay.

673
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,320
How are you?

674
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,240
Miss Fang.

675
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,640
Why are you here?

676
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm here as a hospital mate.

677
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,760
You should go back.

678
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,000
If Lin knows,

679
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
he'll be worried about you.

680
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,560
He came just now.

681
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,560
I heard from the nurse that

682
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,960
your readings aren't going down.

683
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,520
It's like drinking alcohol.

684

Why is there even an after-effect?

685

Seriously.

686
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,360
It's okay. Relax.

00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
Now that I'm watching you,
I still feel like crying.

Go.

719
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,080
You're already discharged.

720
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,520
Why isn't there

721
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
any news about him?

722
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
I don't know.

723
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
The doctor said his readings

724
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,200
haven't gone down.

725
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,680
He's a man

726
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,720
and he's weaker than you.

727
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,520
Maybe it's because

728
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,440
no one's taking care of him.

729
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,040
If you miss him,

730
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
just give him a call.

731
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,440
How about you call him?

732
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,840
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

733
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,600
Sorry.

734
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,240
Powered off.

735
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,480
Powered off?

736
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,200
Why would it be powered off?

737
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,480
Don't tell me something happened.

738
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,680
No way.

739
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,120
Maybe his phone ran out of battery?

740
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,880
No.

741
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,400
I need to go and have a look.

742
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,160
Hello.

743
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,240
Can I know

744
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,920
where the patient is

745
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,640
who was using this bed?

746
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,920
I'm not sure.

747
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,800
I just got transferred here.

748
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,680
But I heard the nurse said that

749
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,320
a patient was

750
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,440
sent for resuscitation just now.

751
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,520
Resuscitation...

752
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,280
This is the resuscitation room.

753
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
What are you doing?

754
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,720
I'm the patient's family member.

755
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,800
Family members can't go in.

756
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,760
Doctors are resuscitating the patient.

757
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,040
Wasn't he okay?

758
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,720
Why...Why did he need resuscitation
all of a sudden?

759
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,680
Please calm down.

760
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,080
The patient has developed

761
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,160
viral myocarditis.

762
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,280
He's in critical condition.

763
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,600
Please don't cause more trouble here.

764
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,800
Just wait for the news.

Qin Qing.,

784
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,960
I agreed to break up with you at the time

785
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,920
because I didn't want to push you.

786
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,560
But now, I want to

787
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,440
give myself a push.

788
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,600
You were right.

789
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,840
Lover and soulmate

790
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,880
are two entirely

791

different concepts.

792
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,400

793

794
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
Can you stop

795
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,440

796

797
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,560
and trap yourself in it?

Sometimes,

800

standards are
