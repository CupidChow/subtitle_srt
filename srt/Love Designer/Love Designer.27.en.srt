many problems in quality as well.

After a check in a hospital, it was said

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
to be due to the quality of the clothes.

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
It seems like this news is talking

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
about us.

70
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
No problem.

Calm down.

72

But a lot of buyers are

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
applying for purchase returns.

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Then let them return their purchases.

75

Don't overthink

136
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,880
and don't go walking around.

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Wait for me back home.

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Today, I asked you to come.

139
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm sure you all know about the reason.

140
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Chen Chen, tell them.

141
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,600
Okay.

142
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,320
After the investigation,

143
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
the allergic reactions were due to

144
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,960
the allergenic dyes in the textile

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
exceeding the standard.

146
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,560
which leads to contact dermatitis.

147
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,160
Long-term contacting with the skin

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,560
it may also induce cancer.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Hence, this issue

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,480
is very serious.

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
President Song has ordered

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,560
investigation on the dye and
the preparation factories.

153
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,120
We'll find the source of the issue soon.

154
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,880

155
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,160

156
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
a fashion company.

157
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,160
The clothes that we made

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,520
has caused health problems

159
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,200
to our consumers.

160
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,600
This is a big problem.

161
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,920
I think this problem

162
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,120
will continue to simmer.

163
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
Presidents, let's hear your thoughts.

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,680
President Song.

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
I think at the moment,

166
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,280
the most urgent thing is to
recall the products

167
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,120
and negotiate with the consumers

168
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,080
to compensate them privately.

169
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,680
Minimize the loss as much as we can.

170
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,800
We can't

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
draw fire upon ourselves.

172
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,640
This issue is

173
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,440
an operational problem of the brand.

174
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,840
It's their own fault.

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
They need to bear the consequences.

176
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
We need to draw the line

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,200
with the brand.

178
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
We can't let Wan Feng Group

179
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
get involved in this.

180
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,960
We need the consumers to be clear that

181
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,760
this issue is

182
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,840
a mistake of the brand.

183
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,160
Because of

184
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
the plagiarism issue before,

185
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
our brand was taken down explicitly.

186
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
Now that it went back online,

187
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
a more serious issue happens again.

188
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,640
The shareholders will pick on this.

189
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Therefore,

190
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,040
we need to come to a verdict now.

191
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
Or else, a series of chain reactions

192
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
will make the situation go out of control.

193
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,400
The compensation and drawing lines

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,320
that you all mentioned

195
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,080
can't solve

196
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,880
the fundamental problem.

197
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,440
If the fundamental problem isn't solved,

198
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,360
similar problems will

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,040
arise next time.

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
What happens then?

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
But the current problem

202
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,640
should be solved first.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,480
As for the fundamental problem...

204
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,360
President Song.

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
There are no outsiders here,

206
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
I'll be direct.

207
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,080
I think you're too much of a gentleman.

208
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,200
We can totally

209
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,000
let them have

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
a taste of their own medicine.

211
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,360
If the issue this time

212
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,840
is really related to Bai Sai Group,

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
I have an idea.

214
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,760
After all, Bai Sai Group is

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,360
a listed company.

216
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,720
In terms of reputation,

217
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,559
they have to be more cautious.

218
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,640
If they

219
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,840
took improper approaches to

220
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
carry out the competition in the market,

221
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,400
we can seek

222
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,159
legal means to

223
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,039
press charges against their actions.

224
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Let them get the punishment they deserved.

225
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
Even if they clarify afterwards,

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,480
on the one hand, their stock price

227
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,640
would be affected.

228
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,760
On the other hand,

229
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
there's already a scandal.

230
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
The impact towards Bai Sai Group

231
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
will be irreversible.

232
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,240
Sorry.

233
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,720
I came back late.

234
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,680
Don't worry.

235
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
This war,

236
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
we'll win it soon.

237
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,600
How do you plan to win it?

238
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
This issue...

239
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
was planned by you?

240
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,880
The people in Wan Feng Group

241
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,920
are already panicking.

242
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,680
We can take this chance to

243
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
acquire a lot of their shares.

244
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,360
From now on, within the country,

245
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,080
there won't be any strong

246
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,880
competitions anymore.

247
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Once the acquirement is over,

248
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,680
can we take

249
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480
a rest?

250
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
Happy birthday.

251
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you like it?

252
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you.

253
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,200
You rest first.

254
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll come back after some work.

255
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,680
Why are you here?

256
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,560
I knew you had nowhere to go

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
and didn't want to go home.

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's find a place and drink.

259
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,880
Sure.

260
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,880
Why are you zoning out?

261
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm trying to sort out my thoughts.

262
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,880
Didn't Mencius once said?

263
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,440
To be bestowed with great responsibility,
one must be crucified with an ordeal

264
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,520
so as to break one's will and spirit,

265
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,160
exhaust one's muscles.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,240
You're already halfway there.

267
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,000
You're good at consoling.

268
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm just thinking...

269
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm scared that this issue

270
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
would affect Song Lin.

271
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,600
Regardless of whether

272
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
it is someone framed me

273
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,920
or just my bad luck,

274
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,240
he always rushes to the front line

275
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,000
to solve it for me.

276
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
I think it's a bit unfair.

277
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
What's unfair about it?

278
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Having a man standing in front

279
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,960
and protecting you.

280
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
Isn't that good?

281
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,760
But I think it's unfair.

282
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,600
This world itself

283
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,280
is unfair.

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The roles of men and women

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,880
are different as well.

286
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,880
After all, he loves you so much.

287
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,320
It's not about whether he loves me.

288
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,560
It's about him

289
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
stepping forward every time something happens.

290
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,440
I think he should be treated fairly.

291
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,880
I think you care about him too much.

292
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,080
This Song Lin...

293
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,480
Which part of him

294
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
attracts you so much?

295
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,640
What's with your expression?

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't have any expression.

297
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,640
Then, what's in your mind?

298
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,040
What's in your mind?

299
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Let's go back soon!

300
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,440
So eager to meet him?

301
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,880
Fine.

302
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,920
You're back.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm back.

304
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,720
You must be tired.

305
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm so tired. I'm so tired.

306
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
You're so heavy.

307
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,800
Sit down.

308
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll get you some water.

309
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,920
Have some water.

310
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,480
Sit down.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,360
How about?

312
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,600
It's comfortable.

313
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,400
Song Lin.

314
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
Actually, I can

315
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,880
solve this problem myself.

316
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,560
It's the brand's

317
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,680
problem to begin with.

318
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,240
But if you come forward,

319
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,560
it'll affect

320
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,040
Chuang Pin Net and Wan Feng Group.

321
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,320
I know.

322
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
You know it and you still act like this?

323
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Can you be more rational?

324
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
If the result of being rational

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
is to lose you,

326
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
I won't choose to be rational.

327
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,400
Don't worry.

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,360
I'll protect you well this time.

329
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,080
You're up?

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,960
Do you even think about

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
me, your sister?

332
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,880
What is that nonsense?

333
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,960
Hurry and go to school.

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,200
I'll go now.

335
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,560
Don't be late.

336
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,720
Bye.

337
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,920
Chen Chen,

338
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,160
when will the lab test results

339
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,960
be out?

340
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
It'll take a least a week

341
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
to get the results.

342
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,200
A week is too long.

343
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,280
We can't wait that long.

344
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,280
How about this?

345
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll contact my friend for it.

346
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,520
As for the consumers,

347
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,760
contact them.

348
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,480
I'll negotiate

349
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
the compensation with them.

350
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,720
This matter

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,839
shouldn't be done

352
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,720
by you personally, right?

353
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,640
It's good to show some sincerity now.

354
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,160
Okay, I got it.

355
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,760
I don't want perfection.

356
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,640
I just hope that

357
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,800
my regret is something else,

358
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,480
instead of him not loving me.

359
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
I can understand

360
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
your feelings.

361
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,320
But this is life.

362
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,240
I think when you have time,

363
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,840
you should have

364
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
confide to your friends more,

365
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
or chat with

366
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,240
your husband.

367
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,360
This way, it'll be

368
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,880
better for both of you.

369
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
If I have someone to chat with,

370
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
someone to talk to,

371
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,960
I wouldn't be here

372
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,200
having a psychological consult.

373
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,840
I stay at home every day.

374
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,240
Waiting for him.

375
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,720
Waiting for him to come back.

376
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,360
I just want to talk to him.

377
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,760
Even if it's just a few sentences.

378
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,080
Even if

379
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
he scolds me,

380
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,360
I would feel pretty happy.

381
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you understand?

382
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,680
I understand your feelings.

383
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,880
But Miss Lin,

384
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
I think when you're available,

385
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,880
you should bring your husband

386
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,960
here.

387
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,040
-You're here.
-Miss Fang.

388
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,560
Are you okay?

389
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm fine. I'm alright.

390
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,960
I want to ask you for a favor.

391
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,680
What is it? Tell me.

392
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,240
I've written a letter of apology.

393
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,040
I'm not sure

394
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,720
whether it's okay.

395
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,920
Can you check it for me?

396
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,760
You want to make a public apology?

397
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,920
I think...you can still wait for a while.

398
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
If you're too proactive to apologize,

399
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,160
what if the consumers

400
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
accuse you back falsely

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
and simply ask for compensation?

402
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,160
I don't want to wait anymore.

403
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,600
I'll compensate if I have to.

404
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Someone has to come out

405
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,520
and apologize for this matter.

406
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Plus, this matter

407
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,880
has to be solved with

408
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
on my own,

409
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
or else, more people will be involved.

410
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,680
You just don't want to involve Song Lin,
right?

411
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,360
Why are you here?

412
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Why release a letter of apology?

413
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,040
I don't agree.

414
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,960
I have my plans.

415
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
Someone needs to step forward

416
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
and apologize for this matter.

417
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,520
Furthermore, I am

418
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,560
the person in charge of the studio.

419
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,680
If I

420
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,440
hide now,

421
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,400
in the future,

422
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,200
how can I explain it

423
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,320
to my staff and consumers?

424
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,960
I know you're doing it for me.

425
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,360
But if we can correct our mistakes,

426
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,000
I think next time,

427
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,680
we won't make

428
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,400
the same mistake again.

429
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Just this once.

430
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,440
It won't happen again.

431
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
Let me have a look.

432
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,400
Look at what?

433
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,760
Letter of apology.

434
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,600
It's here.

435
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
So sincere?

436
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,880
Of course.

437
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
This year, Wan Feng Group

438
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,040
kept having

439
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,920
issues with reputation.

440
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,480
This is an

441
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,360
undeniable fact.

442
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,280
This is what an enterprise

443
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,960
fears the most.

444
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
A small leak can sink a great ship.

445
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
If this carries on,

446
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,480
I'm afraid

447
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
we won't make up for the loss.

448
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,720
I agree.

449
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,920
For these two years, the global economy

450
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,600
hasn't been stable.

451
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
The competition within each industry

452
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,920
is getting stiffer as well.

453
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,120
Our current situation

454
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,880
is not a coincidence.

455
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,840
But if we don't take actions,

456
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
sooner or later, Wan Feng's reputation

457
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
will be worn down.

458
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,880
Within an industry,

459
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,080
the resources are limited.

460
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,360
Rather than having enemies,

461
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,400
it's better to cooperate for a win-win.

462
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
I think

463
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,920
now, we can consider

464
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
the acquisition plan that

465
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,720
I suggested before.

466
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,960
Before it collapses,

467
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
sell it with the best price.

468
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,520
You all know about

469
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,240
Wan Feng's business plan

470
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
for these two years.

471
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,640
Plus, our overseas market

472
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
is developing very well now.

473
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,600
Why rush to liquidate?

474
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,720
President Song.

475
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
Don't blame us.

476
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,680
These few years,

477
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,320
the global economy hasn't been stable.

478
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
We all think that,

479
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
only with cash in our hands,

480
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,640
we can feel

481
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,360
more secure.

482
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,600
Now, the only company in the industry

483
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,640
that can

484
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
acquire Wan Feng in one go

485
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,480
is Bai Sai.

486
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,280
Plus, they are keen to acquire.

487
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,120
Nothing is better than that.

488
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,080
To be able to have them as partners.

489
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Why not?

490
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
Wan Feng and Bai Sai

491
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,240
are both fashion companies,

492
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,000
but the projects we carry out

493
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
are entirely different.

494
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,680
Bai Sai focuses on top international brands.

495
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,840
They bring in top tier brands

496
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,040
from overseas into the country

497
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
to set up their flagship stores in

498
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,680
local supermarkets,

499
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,640
Wan Feng

500
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,800
has always focused on

501
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,720
local

502
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,720
designer brands.

503
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,760
We want to introduce

504
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,840
China's designers,

505
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,640
and China's designs

506
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,320
to overseas and export them globally.

507
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,480
This is what we're doing.

508
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Furthermore,

509
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,880
if we partner with them now,

510
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,200
we're not turning

511
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,400
our opponent into a partner,

512
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,520
we are giving away our territory

513
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,320
to the other party.

514
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,760
No offense, President Song.

515
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,040
From the things that happened this year,

516
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,880
I think you changed a bit as well.

517
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,160
In a lot of matters, you were unlike before.

518
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,240
You were really indecisive

519
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,960
and misjudged several times.

520
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,360
Where do you place

521
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
the interests of the company

522
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,400
and shareholders?

523
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
I don't like what you said.

524
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
We did nothing but invested some money,

525
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,040
and acquired some shares.

526
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,480
The one who has been striving
for Wan Feng Group

527
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,960
has always been President Song

528
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,880
and his team.

529
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,640
If not for President Song,

530
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,280
where did the money that we earned
all these years

531
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,280
come from?

532
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,920
Blown over by the wind?

533
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,560
Exactly.

534
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,200
President Song's hard work

535
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,320
is well appreciated.

536
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,600
He is insightful

537
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
and has a good executive ability.

538
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,440
Otherwise, all of us wouldn't have

539
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,320
joined Wan Feng.

540
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,000
Am I right?

541
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,360
Yes.

542
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,840
But, a successful investment

543
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,800
will eventually reach its time to pull out.

544
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,120
I'm simply choosing

545
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,840
a close-to-peak time to do so.

546
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
However,

547
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,000
President Song

548
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,440
is Wan Feng Group's

549
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,360
largest shareholder after all.

550
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,360
If the shares that

551
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,320
we sell off end up not being a lot,

552
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,320
then, for President Song,

553
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,400
it shouldn't have

554
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,200
much impact.

555
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,400
Am I right?

556
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,800
Unless the shares that are sold

557
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,240
exceed your ratio.

558
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,960
But,

559
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
this won't be possible.

560
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,140
[Letter of Apology]

561
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, my.

562
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,160
What is this?

563
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,960
Zhou Fang,

564
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,000
I saw your

565
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
letter of apology online.

566
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
What's going on?

567
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,680
I am Zhou Fang,

568
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,320
Fang Studio's

569
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,080
chief designer

570
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,320
and brand director.

571
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,520
A few days ago, some consumers feedbacked that

572
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,840
a few of our shop's garments

573
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
had quality issues.

574
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,920
We are trying our best to

575
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
investigate the whole situation.

576
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,760
Before the results are announced,

577
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,200
to all the consumers,

578
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,640
everyone who has

579
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,520
supported our brand,

580
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,360
I am sincerely sorry.

581
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,640
I'd also like to apologize to

582
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,360
Chuang Pin Net

583
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,840
and Wan Feng Group, who have

584
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,280
supported the development of our brand.

585
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,360
No matter what the result is,

586
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,600
this remains our fault.

587
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,160
At the management level,

588
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,480
the lack of strict monitoring

589
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,320
resulted in contaminated materials

590
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,160
getting into the market.

591
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,400
My sincere apologies for that.

592
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,040
At the same time, I will do my best

593
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
to make up for the loss of the consumers.

594
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,600
I hope everyone

595
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,440
can give me a

596
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,160
chance to start over.

597
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,560
In the future,

598
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
I will ensure to pay attention

599
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,560
so that similar issues

600
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,440
will not arise again.

601
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Please watch over us.

602
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:18,960
President Song,

603
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,960
you don't have to be so angry.

604
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,480
Zhou Fang was

605
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
a bit rash today.

606
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,160
But it's all to

607
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,440
help us regain our reputation.

608
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,760
She can't even

609
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,800
fend for herself.

610
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,000
Yet, she's thinking about you.

611
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,040
That's loyal.

612
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,640
Loyal?

613
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
We're doing business here,

614
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,640
not barging through the world.

615
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
Loyalty alone is useless.

616
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,640
If she didn't apologize today,

617
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,760
the loyal one who barges through the world

618
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,320
would be you.

619
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,360
Okay then.

620
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,200
If there's anything,

621
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
call me at any time.

622
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,480
Thank you, Lawyer Shen.

623
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,320
It's my job.

624
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,120
You're welcome.

625
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,040
I'll get going then.

626
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay. Goodbye.

627
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,720
How was the discussion?

628
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,560
What about the supplier?

629
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,680
You need to sue them.

630
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,840
President Song is

631
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,880
already investigating this issue.

632
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,400
If they find anything,

633
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,600
they'll press charges.

634
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,800
By then, we'll bring them out

635
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,720
and show their face to the public.

636
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,960
This issue is their fault,

637
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,360
but we're the ones taking the blame.

638
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,800
This issue was indeed

639
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,600
my oversight as well.

640
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,440
Next time, a crucial stage

641
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
and the important matter like this

642
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,720
should be overseen

643
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,280
by our own staff.

644
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,360
A newly established brand

645
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,760
is like kids learning how to walk.

646
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,040
It's normal to trip and fall.

647
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,400
Which brand dares to say that

648
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,520
they've never had problems before?

649
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,080
Right?

650
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,160
So,

651
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,080
the important thing is

652
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,280
how we handle it.

653
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,640
From TKY Shop's

654
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,040
establishment until now,

655
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,880
everyone has been working hard.

656
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,520
Nothing can't be overcome.

657
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,680
These few days, I've

658
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,480
done a bit of research.

659
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Quality control of dye material

660
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,520
is a common

661
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,360
source of problems.

662
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,000
On the one hand,

663
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
I'm feel bad for you.

664
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,880
On the other hand,

665
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,080
I'm sorry towards the consumers.

666
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
They bought the clothes

667
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,360
happily

668
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,320
and this happened.

669
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
If it was me, I wouldn't be happy either.

670
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,640
I have

671
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,720
told the staff.

672
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,200
If there are customers at the customer service

673
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,480
who want to return or exchange their items,

674
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,640
we'll do our best to satisfy them.

675
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Besides,

676
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,800
If there's anything

677
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,440
to solve face to face,

678
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,040
I'll compensate in person.

679
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,480
That's all we can do.

680
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
A lot happened in these past few days.

681
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,800
Sorry, Miss Izumino.

682
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:19,880
No problem.

683
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,480
Let's work hard together.

684
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,200
This shall pass.

685
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,880
Let's work hard.

686
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,600
I'll get back to work.

687
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:26,960
Sure.

688
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,560
Have you eaten?

689
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,720
Yeah.

690
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,000
How about you?

691
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,400
Here.

692
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,760
My sister got me water.

693
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,760
This is rare.

694
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,760
My sister's water

695
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,440
tastes different.

696
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,960
Put a sock in it.

697
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
I saw that recently,

698
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,600
you haven't been doing so good.

699
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,200
It's life.

700
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,960
There will always be

701
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,400
small trips and falls.

702
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,160
But you're tough.

703
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,120
You'll get through it.

704
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,280
Luo Luo.

705
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,120
Recently, I think you've

706
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,640
grown up.

707
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
You even know to care about me.

708
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,040
You're my elder brother.

709
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,480
Who else can I care about?

710
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,760
Enough.

711
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,240
I'll do my homework.

712
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,680
Good night.

713
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,920
What are you doing?

714
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,280
Nothing. Just stay at home.

715
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,680
Let's go out.

716
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,000
Sure.

717
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,520
You strained yourself again.

718
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,600
Don't scold me this time.

719
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,640
I don't want that every time something happens,

720
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,000
I would act as if I was not involved,

721
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,840
with my hands in my pocket,

722
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
waiting for you to charge forward

723
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,280
and solve it for me.

724
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,800
I want to shoulder it too.

725
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,640
What kind of

726
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
girlfriend did I have?

727
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,800
It's more like

728
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,120
I have a reliable brother for myself.

729
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
You realized it?

730
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,680
It can't be concealed anymore, bro.

731
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,040
Conceal it from me. Don't tell me.

732
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,400
Didn't we say

733
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,560
we would shoulder it together?

734
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,760
Bro.

735
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,440
Enough!

736
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,800
I know you want to protect me.

737
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,720
You want to make me feel that

738
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
it's safe by your side.

739
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,600
The thing I want to tell you is

740
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,240
I can protect you too.

741
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,400
When you have

742
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
something unhappy,

743
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,480
feeling down and uncomfortable,

744
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,720
or even a bit gloomy,

745
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
you can show everything.

746
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll accept it all.

747
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,800
Because the one I care about

748
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,160
isn't the capable one

749
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,760
to the outside world,

750
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,040
but the one who you really are.

751
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,400
Welcome.

752
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,360
Sorry for the long wait.

753
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,080
President Song is here.

754
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,600
Please have a seat.

755
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,360
Sit, sit, sit.

756
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,760
Thank you all

757
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,640
for making time

758
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
to come over here.

759
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,560
Don't mention it.

760
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,960
At this moment,

761
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,360
if we still

762
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,280
don't unite,

763
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,360
how is that right?

764
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,640
Exactly, President Song.

765
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,920
They have already

766
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,680
formed an alliance.

767
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,840
Probably they plan a hostile takeover.

768
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,040
We need to

769
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
think of something.

770
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Those ungrateful fellows.

771
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,080
They never think about how Wan Feng

772
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,160
got to where it is now.

773
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,680
Exactly, President Song.

774
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
What do you plan to do?

775
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,680
All of us will definitely support you.

776
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,920
Based on the situation now,

777
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,360
if they are really thinking of

778
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,840
hostile acquisition of shares,

779
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,440
then, from my perspective,

780
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
I can only act as fast as I can

781
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
and reacquire

782
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,800
my shares as much as possible

783
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,600
to guarantee my shareholding ratio.

784
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,400
What are

785
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
your thoughts about

786
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,720
my suggestion?

787
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,760
Everyone,

788
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,000
is there any problem with

789
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,840
the share transfer agreement?

790
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,800
It's okay.

791
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,880
No problem.

792
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,920
Since you're satisfied,

793
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,240
we can sign the agreement now.

794
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,920
Sure.

795
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,120
Thank you all.

796
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
I look forward to working with you.

797
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,280
Good to work with you, President Su.

798
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,360
Thank you, President Su.

799
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,640
Look forward to working with you.

800
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,200
Is this comrade Zhou Fang?

801
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,800
Dad.

802
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
What brought you here?

803
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,240
You should have called me.

804
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,160
You just sat there?

805
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,000
Dad is not that silly.

806
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,600
I checked the time before coming.

807
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,080
Where's my mom?

808
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,360
Your mom wanted to come too.

809
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
But I stopped her.

810
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
Luckily. Let's go inside and talk.

811
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,240
Madam Cheng.

812
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,480
Sorry, I'm late.

813
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,880
I came early.

814
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,360
Uhm...

815
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,720
We'd like to order.

816
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,960
Hello, what would you like to drink?

817
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,360
I'll just have water.

818
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,680
As for Madam, a cup of

819
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,680
Americano.

820
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,680
The coffee beans need to be

821
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,240
roasted darker.

822
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,520
Sure. Please wait for a while.

823
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,080
Thank you.

824
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,680
Not bad. You still remember my taste.

825
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Of course, I can't forget.

826
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,280
Madam Cheng

827
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,520
enjoys a quality lifestyle.

828
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,120
That's why your brand

829
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,800
has always been

830
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,040
in the front line of the industry.

831
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,960
I'm old now.

832
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,280
This market

833
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,800
is where you youngsters

834
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,160
make a name for yourselves.

835
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
Ever since you left the company,

836
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,120
I really never thought that

837
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,199
the rate of your growth

838
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,719
can be so fast.

839
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,480
This is because you were the one

840
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,960
who brought me into the industry.

841
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,320
I had a good teacher.

842
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,719
After you passed Si Yue over to me,

843
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm still not able to

844
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
hand in

845
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,080
a good answer until now.

846
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,639
Business is ever-changing.

847
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,480
A period of ups and downs

848
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,600
means nothing.

849
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,080
Oh, yeah, Song.

850
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,320
For Wan Feng,

851
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,239
how many shares can you get?

852
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,560
Currently in my hands, there is

853
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
38%.

854
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,199
Have you added it with mine?

855
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,719
No.

856
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,280
Wan Feng's shares are important

857
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,440
to you.

858
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,880
You now have

859
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,320
43%.

860
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,200
Dad.

861
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
Here. Have some tea.

862
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,960
Anyway,

863
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,280
although the process

864
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,560
was a bit messy in the middle,

865
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,840
everything is under your daughter,

866
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,840
my control.

867
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,200
Stay put to devise the strategy

868
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,120
for the victory of a distant battle.

869
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,360
My daughter's a military expert now.

870
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
Are you confident?

871
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,680
Of course, I'm confident.

872
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,240
Plus, I'm not

873
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,920
the only one

874
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,640
solving the matter.

875
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,320
My team is

876
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,160
helping me as well.

877
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,200
Each of them

878
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,480
is trying to think of a solution for me.

879
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm very thankful for that.

880
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,560
Horses for courses.

881
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,800
You're better than me at that.

882
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,840
I like your confidence.

883
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,520
There are situations that

884
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,880
you have to experience

885
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,640
to realize a lot of things.

886
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,280
How did the lyrics sing again?

887
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,000
If there's no wind and rain,

888
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,880
how would there be rainbow?

889
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,240
Exactly.

890
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,120
To be honest,

891
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,720
I only recently realized that

892
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,600
experiencing those problems,

893
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,600
each problem

894
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,640
has helped me to grow.

895
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,200
Just like what you said, sometimes,

896
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,280
experiencing setbacks

897
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
isn't exactly a bad thing.

898
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,960
Each process

899
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,680
happens for a reason.

900
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,360
Moreover,

901
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
when I think about it,

902
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,320
if I really can't take it anymore,

903
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,600
there are still you and mom back home.

904
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,440
When I think about this,

905
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,960
I'm full of energy.

906
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
It's not like you'll

907
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,840
throw me away, right?

908
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,680
Fine.

909
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
With what you just said,

910
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,000
I feel much at ease.

911
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,880
It's too late.

912
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,400
I need to go back.

913
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,880
So rush?

914
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,600
Your mom is waiting for me

915
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,840
to report to her.

916
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,080
Fine.

917
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,560
Be careful on your way back.

918
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,280
It's a deal then.

919
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,720
Come back home during the weekend.

920
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,320
I will cook you something good.

921
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,280
Sure.

922
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,880
I'll go now.

923
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,200
I'll walk you out.

924
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,400
You don't have to.

925
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,400
Madam Cheng,

926
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,480
even now,

927
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,400
you're still willing to help me.

928
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,040
Thank you so much.

929
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,360
That's because you're talented

930
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
and virtuous,

931
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,560
unlike the youngsters nowadays.

932
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,440
There aren't many youngsters nowadays

933
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,520
who know about

934
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,560
gratitude.

935
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,520
Few are as upright

936
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,760
as you.

937
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,640
I believe in you.

938
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,760
In the future,

939
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
you'll achieve great things.

940
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,880
We're

941
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
running a business, and sometimes,

942
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,880
there's no other way.

943
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
When I think of it sometimes,

944
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,160
if I had used some tactics

945
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,920
at the beginning,

946
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,000
I wouldn't have

947
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,040
ended up like this today.

948
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,320
You have to remember.

949
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
The world won't turn its back

950
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
on someone conscientious.

951
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,480
To have a clear conscience,

952
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,520
the road might get

953
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
a bit rougher for you.

954
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,400
But you'll go farther.

955
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,600
It appears that Su Yu Shan has been

956
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,560
giving you a hard time.

957
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,840
So many years have passed.

958
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,440
Even I came out of it.

959
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,640
He's still trapped inside.

960
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
I didn't expect it either.

961
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,520
He'd be so persistent with Si Yue.

962
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,240
But Madam Cheng, don't worry.

963
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,560
I'll definitely develop Si Yue well

964
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,800
and let it go a long way.

965
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,960
You and he are rivals.

966
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,040
But for my daughter,

967
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,640
he is indeed

968
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,920
an affectionate man.

969
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,960
Enough.

970
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,320
Let's not talk about old memories.

971
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,560
Let's talk about you.

972
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,680
I heard that you're in a relationship.

973
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,800
Why do you know everything?

974
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,440
Bring her to meet me.

975
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,440
Of course, of course.

976
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,360
I'm preparing for it.

977
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,520
President Su.

978
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,440
All of the agreements

979
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,680
on the acquisition this time are here.

980
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,240
A few newly confirmed ones

981
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,080
need your signature.

982
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,560
President Su.

983
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,920
This time,

984
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,920
acquiring Wan Feng's shares at such a high price,

985
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,160
is it worth it?

986
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
Don't worry. You can leave.

987
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,920
President Song.

988
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,160
Why are you waiting for me here?

989
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,200
President Song.

990
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,160
Let's talk upstairs.

991
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,040
President Song, urgent situation.

992
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Long story short.

993
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,800
How many shares do you have now?

994
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,200
43.

995
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,480
These two days, I've been trying to find out

996
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,720
the situation on Bai Sai's acquisition.

997
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,440
A few shareholders remained neutral.

998
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,720
And some shareholders

999
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,640
have sold their shares

1000
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,520
to Su Yu Shan.

1001
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,320
Your condition right now

1002
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,040
doesn't look optimistic.

1003
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,080
No worries.

1004
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm prepared for

1005
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,560
the worst scenario.

1006
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,560
President Song.

1007
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,280
If Su Yu Shan

1008
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,120
really becomes Wan Feng's

1009
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,640
majority shareholder,

1010
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,720
what would happen to you?

1011
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,400
Should we find another way

1012
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,200
before it's too late?

1013
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,400
Thank you.

1014
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,480
For what?

1015
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,240
Thank you for

1016
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,960
still standing by my side.

1017
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
Go back. Get back to work.

1018
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,640
