[Episode 38]

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm so tired.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,640
Sit for a while.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,640
I'll get you something.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,440
This is Luo Luo's drawing book.

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
Don't forget to take it

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
when you go back later.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay.

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm going to wash up.

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
What's wrong?

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
You called me to come here

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,920
in such a hurry.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Wu San.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,120
I asked him out several times.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
But he didn't come.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,240
I have not seen him

41
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,120
for several days.

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,920
Have you asked him what happened?

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,080
He said he is busy at work.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
He said his mother is sick.

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,840
Anyway, he has a lot of reasons.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,720
Isn't because that

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
his mother is sick?

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,960
Stop bothering.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,600
His mother is sick.

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,520
But he shouldn't

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,680
ignore my messages.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
Furthermore,

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,360
I sent many gifts

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,280
to his mother.

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,840
All the gifts have been returned.

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,640
I have a feeling.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,960
If this condition continues,

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,000
we're done.

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,800
Maybe Ms Tian

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,120
always keeps an eye on him.

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,800
So he can't find a chance

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,520
to see you.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,960
No.

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,600
He is not a mummy's boy.

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
This is really my first time

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,520
to see you

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
becoming so restless and lost

68
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
because of a man.

69
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,280
I don't know

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,200
what's wrong with me.

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,960
I used to think that

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,040
he wouldn't leave me.

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,640
Because he loves me so much.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,840
He will appear when I miss him.

75
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
When I feel annoyed after seeing him,

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,640
he will disappear obediently.

77
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
Now I'm really scared.

78
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,640
I'm scared that he will disappear

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,520
from my life.

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,960
Do not worry.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,000
Wu San is not that kind of person.

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,320
He is very responsible.

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,040
I know that

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,080
he is not that kind of person.

85
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,160
But

86
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,720
I liked

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
Jiang Yan so much before.

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
I didn't act like this.

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,160
Do you think that

90
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,600
I am hopeless already?

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,760
Hopeless.

92
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,640
What to do?

93
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't you just want to see Wu San?

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,040
That's very easy.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,400
It's really not easy.

96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,720
I really can't handle Ms Tian.

97
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,440
You can't do it alone.

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
Let me help you.

99
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Tonight, I'll cook

100
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
your favourite

101
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,760
bean stew noodles for you.

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,960
Mom, let me do it.

103
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,720
Have a taste and see if

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,880
my cooking skill is better or Dad's.

105

Hello, President Song.

106
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,040
Hello, Zuo.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm going to deal with

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,800
an investment project now.

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Come with me.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Please send me the address.

111
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll go and meet you.

112
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,960
No need.

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,080
Send me your address.

114
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,200
I'll pick you up.

115
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Ok, no problem.

116
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
What's wrong?

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Mom.

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,560
The company suddenly
has an urgent matter

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,640
that I need to go to meet a client.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,400
I can't accompany you

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,120
tonight for dinner.

122
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,160
Okay.

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
Go ahead, I'm fine.

124
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,080
Company matters are more important.

125
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,200
Okay, mom, I'm leaving.

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,520
I'm leaving, mom.

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,720
Lin.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
Who are we going to meet today?

129
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,120
I need to get ready.

130
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
You need to get ready indeed.

131
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
Today, we are meeting

132
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
President Zhou and President Qin.

133
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,240
What do you mean?

134
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,360
I didn't expect it, Lin.

135
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
You will do this kind of thing?

136
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,560
Do you think I wish to do so?

137
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,640
Nice watch.

138
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,080
Looks good, right?

139
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
Previously, Qin Qing

140
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,800
went to Italy

141
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,720
with Miss Fang.

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,520
She bought it for me.

143
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,160
Did Miss Fang buy any gift

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,920
for you?

145
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,960
Yes, she did.

146
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
What did she buy for you?

147
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
It's none of your business.

148
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,440
So much nonsense.

149
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,840
I want to compare.

150
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,600
Compare?

151
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,120
Buy me a house. Compare then.

152
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,440
Sweetheart, sorry.

153
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,400
I should explain this matter

154
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
to you clearly.

155
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,160
Sorry for making you worried.

156
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,880
I'm fine.

157
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,640
It's not your fault.

158
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,720
You are not angry?

159
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,040
Why do I have to be angry?

160
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
I am the one being inconsiderate.

161
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,040
I am responsible to tell you

162
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,720
about this matter.

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
But don't worry.

164
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,240
I have figured out a good way

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
to talk to my mom.

166
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,880
But it takes time.

167
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,360
During this period,

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
I also did a self-reflection.

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,520
Why my mom is so against

170
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
towards our relationship?

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,440
Actually, I am

172
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
the main reason.

173
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,840
Because in my mom's eyes,

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,800
I must be

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
a child without judgement.

176
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,480
So she was so anxious

177
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
to decide for me.

178
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,760
I will prove to her

179
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,600
that I am not a child.

180
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
We did not act on impulse

181
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
about our relationship.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
I will do my best

183
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,040
in my career

184
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
and be responsible for my relationship.

185
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,760
So that I can tell her

186
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,720
in an independent and equal position

187
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,600
as soon as possible...

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,920
that I want to be together with you.

189
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,360
It's a notice, not a request.

190
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,159
Was it fun in Italy?

191
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,440
Did you go out

192
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,159
for shopping?

193
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,400
Yes.

194
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,880
Did you buy anything

195
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
that you like?

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,400
Of course, I did.

197
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,280
What did you buy?

198
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
Clothes, bags,

199
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
shoes, jewelers, make-ups...

200
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,480
You bought so many things.

201
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,840
Did you have a look at

202
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,800
menswear or something else?

203
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,800
I didn't go shopping for menswear.

204
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,880
I only look for womenswear.

205
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,200
That's true.

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Why did you look for menswear?

207
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,640
What's wrong with you?

208
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
What does your facial expression mean?

209
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,720
What facial expression?

210
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
Nothing, just chatting.

211
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,560
During this time, I have been thinking

212
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,520
how to prove myself

213
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
to my mom.

214
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,560
But I didn't provide you

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,400
with a sense of security.

216
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,640
Wu San.

218
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Qin Qing.

219
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
You don't need to say anything.

220
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
I just want to tell you

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
regardless

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,960
of the situation now,

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
in my heart,

224
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,840
I, Zuo Yu Lin

225
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,760
have realized that

226
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,200
my life would not be complete

227
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,000
without Qin Qing.

228
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
Do not worry.

229
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
I will definitely work hard.

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,080
Blame on me.

231
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
I was so naughty when I was young

232
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,760
that makes you feel difficult now.

233
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I blame myself for being so obedient
when I was young

234
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,240
that makes you feel so wronged.

235
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,720
Let me look at you.

236
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
I haven't seen you for these few days.

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,760
You are not eating well again.

238
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
You became thinner again.

239
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,680
Let me cook some good food for you.

240
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Wu San.

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,800
Hug me again.

242
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
Okay.

243
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,240
Sweetheart.

244
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,880
Promise me to take good care of yourself.

245
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,240
I will.

246
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
Eat on time.

247
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,000
Sleep well, okay?

248
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
You too, eat well.

249
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Enough.

250
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm leaving now.

251
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,800
Be good.

252
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,080
After you go back,

253
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,280
listen to your mom.

254
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't talk back to her.

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,640
If

256
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
she asks you to go on a blind date,

257
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,720
just go.

258
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I know you keep me in your heart.

259
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,200
That's enough.

260
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,280
Do not worry about me.

261
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,640
Zuo.

262
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,040
What time is it?

263
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,920
9:30.

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,880
9:30.

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,360
This watch is nice,
where can I buy it?

266
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Italy.

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
Italy.

268
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Qin Qing bought it for you?

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
That's nice.

270
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,760
Aren't you going back?

271
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,880
I'm not going back.

272
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,680
I'll stay here tonight.

273
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,760
Okay.

274
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,960
You must...

275
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,120
I can't do it.

276
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
I'm leaving.

277
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
Then I'm leaving too.

278
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,040
Wu San.

279
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,000
Be good.

280
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,520
Goodbye.

281
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,280
Drive carefully.

282
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,960
Okay.

283
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,200
I've told you he cares

284
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,920
about that watch.

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,760
Yes, he is.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,640
Lin.

287
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
Can you...

288
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,440
If you are going to let me

289
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,240
see you both being lovey-dovey again,

290
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
don't talk about it anymore.

291
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Next time,

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
I will be only in charge of making phone calls.

293
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,680
Let Chen Chen save you.

294
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,840
Got it, Lin.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
Young man.

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
So happy?

297
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,960
Of course, I'm happy.

298
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm happy

299
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,640
to see my dear Wu San.

300
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,200
Song Lin asked me why

301
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280
I didn't prepare a gift for him.

302
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,720
Why?

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Didn't you buy him a gift?

304
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
You haven't given it to him?

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,840
I haven't done it yet.

306
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,840
What are you doing so hard?

307
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
I don't want to tell you.

308
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,360
I don't want to listen.

309
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
I want to find my dear Wu San.

310
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,280
Coming to the mall early in the morning,

311
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,520
what do you want to buy?

312
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,400
Are you going to

313
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,160
cook for me?

314
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,920
Recently I have been so busy every day,

315
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,880
working overtime every day.

316
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,480
It's been a long time

317
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,440
since I cooked for you.

318
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Didn't last time you say

319
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,120
you want to eat crayfish?

320
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,240
I've learnt it online.

321
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,960
I'll cook for you tonight.

322
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,440
So good?

323
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay.

324
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,760
Tonight, let's invite Ling Xi

325
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
to come over and eat together?

326
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,160
Why invite her

327
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
to come over for dinner?

328
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,840
Didn't you keep on saying that

329
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,880
you want to invite her for a meal?

330
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,120
But you still haven't invited her.

331
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
So this crayfish meal

332
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,640
is not just

333
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,560
for me.

334
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,880
No.

335
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
Back then, my company

336
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
was having a hard time,

337
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,320
we lost our capital fund and

338
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
the equity couldn't sell out,

339
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,760
But later Ling Xi

340
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,480
helped us

341
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,600
sell them out.

342
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,080
At that time, you said you wanted to
invite her for a meal.

343
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,400
But you haven't invited her until now.

344
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm thinking that it will show our sincerity

345
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
if we have a meal together at home?

346
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
It's fine if you are unhappy about it.

347
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,280
Let's eat by ourselves, don't invite her.

348
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,320
Call her.

349
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,600
Or else I look stingy.

350
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,400
You're nice.

351
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
Hurry, give me the plate.

352
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,720
Coming.

353
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,240
Here.

354
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,520
Give you a piece.

355
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,480
Smells good.

356
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,560
Put on the plate.

357
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,880
Is it hot?

358
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
So hot.

359
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,800
Hot.

360
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,120
Is it tasty?

361
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,880
Yes.

362
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,600
Not bad.

363
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,480
What else do you wanna eat?

364
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,400
Let me cook it for you.

365
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,960
Big plate chicken.

366
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,040
I'll open the door.

367
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,160
You came.

368
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
It's my first time coming to your house,

369
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,440
I don't know what to bring.

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
I bought two bottles of red wine.

371
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,960
You are being too courteous.

372
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,520
It must taste good.

373
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,160
Come in.

374
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
Smells good.

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
Almost all dishes are ready.

376
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
Ling Xi is here.

377
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,520
Sit down, sit down, the dishes are ready.

378
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,520
Okay.

379
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
We prepared these for the whole morning.

380
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,160
Looks really sumptuous.

381
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,320
You see.

382
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,480
You rarely come for a visit.

383
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
How can I not prepare more dishes?

384
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,640
All the dishes are served?

385
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,440
All done.

386
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,360
Quickly have a bite.

387
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,400
Not bad.

388
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,320
Try it.

389
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
It's really delicious.

390
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,560
Let me tell you.

391
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
Today, Zhou Fang and I

392
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,160
have done nothing except cooking.

393
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,800
Thank you both for preparing these.

394
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,320
Come.

395
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,760
Come, welcome to my house.

396
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,720
I actually want

397
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,520
to thank Ling Xi.

398
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,960
If she didn't help me

399
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,200
sell ​​the shares

400
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
to gain some capital fund,

401
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
this house would be gone.

402
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
I didn't agree to

403
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
live with you.

404
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,320
When are you

405
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,040
going to agree then?

406
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,520
See how's your performance.

407
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,200
My performance?

408
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,520
I will do well.

409
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,800
It's really awkward for me

410
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,000
to watch you both being romantic.

411
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,760
It's okay, you have soup too.

412
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
How delicious.

413
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,680
Nice cooking skills.

414
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,280
Come.

415
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,960
Thank you both for your kind hospitality.

416
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,760
Then,

417
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,119
we all must

418
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,480
keep on working hard.

419
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,960
Cheers.

420
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,040
Work hard.

421
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,119
Come on.

422
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,760
Zhou Fang.

423
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,080
President Su.

424
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,480
Here is the thing.

425
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,840
We are preparing to launch

426
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,920
the application online in advance.

427
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Can you give me

428
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,880
more designs?

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,880
Yes, I can.

430
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,440
But will this matter

431
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,320
affect Song Lin?

432
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,560
To be frank,

433
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,800
yes.

434
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,240
I know you are

435
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,160
Song Lin's girlfriend.

436
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,320
But since the day

437
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,280
you chose Wan Feng,

438
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
you're destined

439
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,040
to be his competitor.

440
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,480
In our field,

441
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,280
if you want to succeed, you must take the first place.

442
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
Otherwise, you will fail.

443
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,320
I will support you

444
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,880
and be confident to you

445
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,040
as always.

446
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,840
Su Yu Shan came to me today.

447
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,560
It's okay, don't worry.

448
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,840
Now

449
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,880
it is the important stage

450
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,120
where we both sides are competing.

451
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,160
We both should

452
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
avoid each other to some extent.

453
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,640
Is there anything I can help you?

454
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,480
You want to help me?

455
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
Let me think about it.

456
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,280
Work hard then.

457
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,960
Work hard to be

458
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,880
my most powerful opponent.

459
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,200
After all, I'll become

460
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
stronger when I meet a strong opponent.

461
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,880
I can't do anything about it.

462
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,840
But...

463
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,320
Don't say it anymore.

464
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
I'm so tired lately.

465
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,720
After some time,

466
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
It'll be more tiring when the new product launches.

467
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
But I feel better when I hug you.

468
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Why?

469
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,520
Let's go home.

470
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,360
I don't dare to be absent from work now.

471
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,000
Go to your house or mine?

472
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,040
My house?

473
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:58,920
Let's go.

474
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,720
President Song.

475
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,720
President Song.

476
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,600
Welcome home.

477
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,320
President Song, how is it?

478
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,400
Are you surprised?

479
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,720
Most of the Wan Feng's former employees

480
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
are back.

481
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,080
Thank you all for choosing me again

482
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,680
and willing to work with me.

483
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,680
Thank you.

484
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,600
Thank you all.

485
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,560
Let me introduce her

486
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,240
to you all.

487
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
She is the new shareholder of our company

488
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,280
and the foreign agent

489
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
of our company.

490
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,960
Ling Xi, President Ling.

491
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
This time, thanks to President Ling's help.

492
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,480
Our company managed to

493
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,160
operate until today.

494
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,040
Hello, President Ling.

495
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,280
Hello, everyone.

496
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,560
I have been in the industry
for so many years.

497
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,480
I rarely make mistakes

498
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,440
on my insight.

499
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
I believe this time,

500
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,480
you all

501
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,080
won't disappoint me.

502
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,680
Don't worry, President Ling.

503
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,720
Our company

504
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,840
is just getting started

505
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
on the virtual haute-couture field,

506
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,440
but technically,

507
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,160
Zuo And Fei

508
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,760
has achieved a lot

509
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,600
before this.

510
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,080
So now,

511
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,680
you all just need to

512
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,840
work together with me in the future.

513
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,800
Are you confident?

514
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,720
Yes!

515
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,320
Let's work hard.

516
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
President Song.

517
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,040
Wan Feng's

518
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,160
application has been launched online today.

519
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,020
[Wan Feng Group 's online try-on
application is launched]

520
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,840
Su Yu Shan

521
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,640
has chosen a good day

522
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,800
to surprise us.

523
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,280
It's okay, do your work first.

524
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,760
You are drawing again.

525
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,400
Aren't you particularly busy?

526
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,840
Why are you still have time to come here?

527
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
I am here to send you a meal

528
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,240
upon someone's request.

529
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
Stop working, Miss Workaholic.

530
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,360
Eat something first.

531
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
Thanks for sending the food every day.

532
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Did you receive a good order?

533
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,040
Apparently this diamond

534
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,360
is at least ten carats, right?

535
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,840
Five carats.

536
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
Can I open it and see?

537
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,640
Okay, be careful.

538
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,280
Okay.

539
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,960
It's very expensive.

540
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,280
You... It's very expensive, okay?

541
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,400
Looks good.

542
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,560
A tasteless rich man

543
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,880
wants to use it for a marriage proposal.

544
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
I guess he is very sincere.

545
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,040
He is very sincere indeed.

546
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,600
He has a good taste

547
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,960
that he knows to ask me to do design.

548
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,280
How could he be tasteless to

549
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,440
ask you to design?

550
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
He has very good taste.

551
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,040
If one day you get married,

552
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,320
will you ask me

553
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,160
to design your diamond ring?

554
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,760
Of course, I will.

555
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,760
Have you ever thought of

556
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,840
how your diamond ring

557
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,920
would look like?

558
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,120
I guess it would be something like this.

559
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,120
Do you think

560
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,760
this design needs

561
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,920
any modification?

562
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,240
I think it's perfect.

563
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,040
No need to modify.

564
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,520
If one day,

565
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,600
someone is holding this ring

566
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,640
and proposes to me,

567
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
I would say yes immediately.

568
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,400
What are you smiling?

569
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,920
I didn't.

570
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
You did.

571
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
What were you smiling at just now?

572
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
I'm hungry, let's eat.

573
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
Tell me, what were you smiling at?

574
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,640
I didn't.

575
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,120
The security system

576
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,040
must be monitored closely.

577
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Understand.

578
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,920
Take a look over here.

579
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,200
Is everything okay?

580
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,520
It's fine, President Song.

581
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,960
After

582
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,480
the security system

583
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
has been upgraded,

584
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,560
there are no more loopholes.

585
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
Now the pressure is also the motivation,

586
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,880
understand?

587
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
We need to hold this breath.

588
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,840
We can't be sloppy

589
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
on the customer's privacy.

590
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,240
Okay.

591
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,320
After the internal test

592
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,480
within these two days,

593
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,800
we can launch it online for the beta test.

594
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,480
Continue your work.

595
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Thank you all

596
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,360
for your hard work during this time.

597
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,080
I will reward you all

598
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,680
after some time.

599
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,640
Okay, thank you, President Song.

600
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,480
Hurry up.

601
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,820
[Chairman's office]

602
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,520
Don't worry.

603
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,440
Our application

604
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
will be launched online as soon as possible.

605
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,760
Okay, bye.

606
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,960
The investors are giving you pressure again?

607
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,280
I can handle them.

608
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,000
You

609
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,080
just need to focus

610
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,280
on your software now.

611
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,760
Leave everything else.

612
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,840
We have

613
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,120
lost the opportunity now.

614
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,920
Did you know

615
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,120
the key to our negotiation

616
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,760
in the U.S.?

617
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,000
Wasn't it because

618
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,040
you invested all the assets

619
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,760
in the project?

620
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,960
So

621
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,120
they agreed in the end.

622
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,720
The success of this company

623
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,760
does not depend

624
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,800
on you alone,

625
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,600
it depends on me too.

626
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,760
Why are you always

627
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,560
full of fighting spirit.

628
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,160
Have you ever...

629
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,400
had the moment...

630
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,880
the moment that you feel

631
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,280
really desperate?

632
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,480
Actually,

633
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,040
I have things that I wanted to achieve

634
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,040
but I couldn't make it.

635
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,920
But I understand that

636
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,640
I may not get it

637
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,360
forever.

638
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,480
By the way,

639
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,960
tonight, Su Yu Shan

640
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,720
invited us for dinner.

641
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,280
What does he want?

642
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
My gut tells me that

643
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,720
we have to attend tonight.

644
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Anyway,

645
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,440
we must not show any weakness.

646
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,360
Zhou Fang.

647
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,120
President Su.

648
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,480
This time, you contributed a lot,

649
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,840
so we managed

650
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,680
to launch the application successfully in time

651
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,200
I would like to invite you for dinner tonight

652
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,720
as a celebration.

653
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,480
I have something to do tonight.

654
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,120
It's time to relax.

655
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,240
It's decided.

656
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,200
I will ask my assistant

657
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
to send you the restaurant address.

658
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,840
President Ling, President Song.

659
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,480
Come here, please come in.

660
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,280
Sorry, President Su,

661
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,440
for keeping you waiting.

662
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,880
We are brothers.

663
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
No worry.

664
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,560
We still need to be courteous.

665
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,320
What's the matter?

666
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,440
Just thought of

667
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,720
inviting you both for a meal

668
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
as a token of gratitude.

669
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,120
Today,

670
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,000
our application was launched online.

671
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Thanks to

672
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
the solid foundation of Wan Feng

673
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,320
that had been built by President Song.

674
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,880
Of course.

675
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
Thanks to President Ling.

676
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,360
Your past evaluation

677
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
managed to provide us

678
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
with a large amount of funds.

679
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,880
You are too humble.

680
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,640
Wan Feng

681
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,040
can perform so well

682
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,320
under the leadership of President Su

683
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,240
who is such a capable person,

684
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,360
I'm actually very happy about it.

685
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,840
Wan Feng is a company

686
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,760
that I started by myself.

687
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,000
It's like my own son.

688
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
Here, have a drink.

689
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,160
I'm sorry, I'm late.

690
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Come, sit down.

691
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,200
You didn't tell me that

692
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,360
you have invited my girlfriend as well?

693
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,120
I didn't know you are coming either.

694
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,360
Hello, Ling Xi.

695
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,960
President Su

696
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
brought us all together

697
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,520
without notifying.

698
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,800
Is there anything you want to say?

699
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,440
I want to say that today

700
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,800
our Wan Feng application

701
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,880
managed to launch successfully,

702
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,480
all thanks to Zhou Fang's designs.

703
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,800
Because of her designs,

704
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
the number of registered users

705
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,920
is constantly soaring.

706
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,320
But at the same time,

707
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,960
your application

708
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,480
has turned into a counterfeit.

709
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,560
This is the point

710
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,640
that I would like to apologize for.

711
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,960
I don't need an apology.

712
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,400
In this industry,

713
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,280
we should be clear that

714
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
who launches it online first

715
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,840
can grab more opportunities in the market.

716
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,560
I can understand.

717
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,840
It's okay.

718
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,400
I know it too.

719
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,040
Your intention today is not just

720
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,200
to invite us for a meal.

721
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,280
The main purpose of President Su is

722
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,600
for me to congratulate you, right?

723
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,200
Then, congratulate you

724
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,960
for a successful launch.

725
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,800
I also hope that

726
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,880
your application can perform better

727
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,360
in the future.

728
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,720
Let's work hard.

729
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,320
Soorry,

730
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,360
I need to use the washroom.

731
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,120
I also want to go to the washroom.

732
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Is this necessary?

733
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,360
Yes.

734
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,680
Are you okay?

735
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
What are you planning to do later?

736
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,480
Of course, we will not

737
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,720
give up so easily.

738
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
Song Lin and I

739
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
will do our best

740
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
to keep the company unaffected

741
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,400
and continue to operate.

742
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,840
Initially, I just wanted

743
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,360
do my job well.

744
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,160
I didn't expect to bring

745
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,320
any burden and pressure to you all.

746
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm very sorry.

747
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,120
Of course, it is right for you

748
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,280
to do your job well.

749
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,200
But have you ever considered

750
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
Song Lin's feelings?

751
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,720
Yes, I am interested in Song Lin.

752
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,440
I'm not feeling well.

753
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm going back first.

754
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,360
If there is nothing else,

755
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,440
I'm going to accompany my girlfriend.

756
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm leaving now.

757
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,720
President Su.

758
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,120
You keep on fighting against us.

759
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
It's quite boring.

760
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,320
You launched the application online in advance

761
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,400
in order to seize the market.

762
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,920
But I think

763
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,840
the loopholes

764
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
in your application

765
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,480
have not been solved yet,

766
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,080
right?

767
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,320
This is not an appropriate attitude

768
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,440
that a smart manager

769
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,160
should have.

770
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,320
President Ling.

771
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,520
Thank you very much

772
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
for your reminder.

773
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,360
Today I also want to remind you that

774
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,920
it takes courage

775
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,680
for one to accept the reality

776
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,920
and acknowledge failure.

777
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,320
Maybe you will lose fewer,

778
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,480
if you stop fighting earlier.

779
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,800
Time can prove everything.

780
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,480
But I believe that

781
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,840
there is not much time left for you

782
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,480
to feel triumphant.

783
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,680
Of course, it is right

784
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,920
for you to do your job well.

785
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,880
But have you ever considered

786
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,720
Song Lin's feelings?

787
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,800
Yes.

788
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,280
I am interested in Song Rin.

789
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,520
What's wrong with you?

790
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,400
Why did you leave

791
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,040
without asking me?

792
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,480
What do you mean?

793
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,680
I felt uncomfortable.

794
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,440
About what?

795
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Just now,

796
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
I actually understand

797
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,640
what Su Yu Shan said

798
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,600
just now.

799
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,600
But I couldn't help you.

800
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,280
As your girlfriend,

801
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,960
I have no way

802
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,240
to stand with you

803
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,120
and fight on the same battlefield

804
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,080
as Ling Xi does.

805
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
So I feel upset.

806
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,640
Why you feel upset?

807
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
What happened today?

808
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,000
What's wrong?

809
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,760
Because his software

810
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,480
launched online?

811
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
Actually I knew earlier that

812
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,320
the software

813
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,960
was going to be launched online.

814
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
But due to the ethical trading policy,

815
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,560
I couldn't tell you.

816
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,080
I sometimes feel myself

817
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,320
like an outsider.

818
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,120
I even have to

819
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
confront you.

820
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,800
Will you hate me?

821
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
Why would I hate you?

822
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,560
Although you are now

823
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,120
working for Su Yu Shan's company,

824
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,240
isn't that just your job?

825
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,240
You are still

826
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,920
my girlfriend.

827
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,400
Your job there

828
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,040
won't affect us

829
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,960
to fight together.

830
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,720
I used to think that

831
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,960
we can fight together side by side.

832
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,160
I thought we can

833
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,800
work hard and

834
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,720
gain success.

835
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,880
But now the business industry

836
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,640
is so competitive.

837
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,200
I did not expect

838
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
it would become a situation like this today.

839
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,080
Song Lin.

840
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,320
I'm really scared that

841
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,160
one day our distance

842
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,040
will get further and further.

843
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm afraid we will

844
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
have nothing to say.

845
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,280
I'm afraid I can't catch you.

846
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,360
Don't think about it anymore, okay?

847
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
I have told you long ago,

848
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,800
no matter what happens

849
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,560
between us,

850
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,840
we will walk to the end together.

851
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,320
Right?

852
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,840
Didn't you agree too?

853
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,280
What do you mean now?

854
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,800
I can't be so sensible

855
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,560
like you.

856
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,679
I don't have the same

857
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,400
capability as Ling Xi's

858
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,080
to help you again and again

859
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,880
and provide you with capital funds.

860
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,679
I can't give you

861
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,679
any professional advice either.

862
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,679
Is she

863
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,520
more suitable for you than me?

864
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,360
Zhou Fang, let me tell you.

865
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,000
You are the best for me.

866
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,719
No one is more suitable for me

867
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,480
than you.

868
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,679
And I won't give

869
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,679
any chance to anyone either.

870
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,480
Okay?

871
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,520
Do you remember?

872
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,040
Don't cry.

873
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,280
Qing, you are here.

874
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
Yes, I am.

875
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,040
You are here.

876
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,200
I know you need me.

877
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,200
So I'm here.

878
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,200
I know you are in a bad mood.

879
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,840
Talk to me.

880
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,280
I think

881
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,160
I feel sorry for him

882
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
on this software incident.

883
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,720
You feel sorry for him?

884
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
What did you do wrong?

885
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,800
You are just working hard

886
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,480
for your career.

887
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,360
What did you do wrong?

888
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,560
I just don't want to be

889
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,520
his competitor.

890
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,800
I don't want to be like this.

891
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,200
What's wrong

892
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,080
if you are his competitor?

893
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,400
Comrade Zhou Fang.

894
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,920
Can I beg you

895
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,360
to separate your love relationship
from your career?

896
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,320
Can you not always think

897
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,600
for other people?

898
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,680
Why it is so tough

899
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,360
to be in a relationship?

900
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,960
It is too difficult.

901
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,240
Why is it

902
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,400
so difficult?

903
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
I'm still comforting you,

904
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,360
while I haven't settled

905
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,120
my own problem yet.

906
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,080
Ms Tian

907
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,560
doesn't accept me at all.

908
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,560
Where are you going?

909
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
This is the dress I made for Ms Tian

910
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,960
according to her body shape

911
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,760
in the photo.

912
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,560
I don't know if the size fits her.

913
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
You send this to her.

914
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
Bring it back

915
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,880
if there is any problem after trying on.

916
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,600
I will modify it for you.

917
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,000
When the time comes,

918
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
you send her

919
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,120
one of your accessories.

920
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,360
So that she can see

921
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,920
your capability.

922
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,080
Let her know

923
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
you are no longer the rebellious girl

924
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,200
during your high school,

925
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,880
but a capable and reliable

926
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,800
jewelry designer.

927
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Here.

928
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,520
Dear.

929
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,880
Why do you always

930
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,800
treat me so well?

931
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,280
Feel like a mother.

932
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,920
Qin Qing.

933
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
The gifts are already prepared for you.

934
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,440
Can't you just come over by yourself?

935
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,240
Why bring me over?

936
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,160
I'm so busy.

937
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
Zhou Fang.

938
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,840
I feel more secure

939
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,240
if you are here.

940
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,720
Besides, you are already here.

941
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,680
Why are you still nagging?

942
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
Where is it?

943
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,480
Right there.

944
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,360
Please come in.

945
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,440
Ms Tian.

946
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,120
Why are you here?

947
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,120
I...

948
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,240
Hello.

949
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,200
Ms Tian,

950
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,760
it's been a long time

951
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,560
since my graduation.

952
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm just here to visit you.

953
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
Just be frank.

954
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Don't beat around the bush.

955
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,520
Ms Tian.

956
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,200
Hello.

957
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,000
I am Zhou Fang,

958
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,160
a friend of Zuo Yu Lin and

959
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,000
Qin Qing.

960
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,280
Qin Qing wanted to visit you

961
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,040
since a long time ago.

962
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,840
She is not sure what gift

963
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,640
we should give to you.

964
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,520
This is a dress

965
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
that is designed by me.

966
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,600
This is a fine jewelry

967
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,400
that is designed by Qin Qing.

968
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,440
We hope you will like it.

969
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,800
They are too expensive.

970
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,560
I can't accept them.

971
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,040
They are not expensive.

972
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,240
This is a small token of gratitude from us.

973
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,120
Thank you.

974
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
But I can never accept

975
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
these.

976
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,360
It's better for you to bring back

977
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,680
and give it to your elders.

978
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
You are my elder.

979
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,440
Thank you.

980
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
Thank you for coming to see me.

981
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,440
You graduated almost ten years ago.

982
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
As a teacher,

983
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,680
I have more

984
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,800
anticipation and blessings for you.

985
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,680
I hope you can have a better life,

986
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,800
and you can find

987
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,200
your happiness as soon as possible.

988
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,040
However,

989
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,960
our Lin Lin

990
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,440
is definitely not your destiny.

991
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,360
I'm sorry.

992
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,120
Drink slowly.

993
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,200
What problem

994
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
can alcohol solve?

995
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,600
Then tell me

996
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,800
how I can solve it.

997
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,120
I want to get drunk now.

998
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,320
I want to forget

999
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,400
how shameful I was just now.

1000
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Were you ashamed just now?

1001
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,280
I don't think so.

1002
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,080
It was not shameful at all, okay?

1003
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,280
I

1004
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,320
always feel

1005
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,200
quite confident in myself.

1006
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,160
But today,

1007
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
just now,

1008
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,720
I feel like I am

1009
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,480
worthless.

1010
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,360
Like a fly,

1011
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,080
I was disgusted by others.

1012
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
Can you stop thinking

1013
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,120
so much?

1014
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,960
I don't even

1015
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,840
think it

1016
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
so embarrassing.

1017
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,000
Maybe she has already

1018
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,680
forgotten about it.

1019
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,880
You are the one who is thinking about it.

1020
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,360
It's okay if she despises me.

1021
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,720
But she treated you

1022
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,440
in a rude way too.

1023
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,800
I don't think

1024
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,680
she was being rude to me.

1025
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,200
Let me tell you.

1026
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,560
This is the first time

1027
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,400
we have made efforts.

1028
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,840
At least, Ms Tian

1029
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,920
had a new perspective about you.

1030
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,080
And she also saw

1031
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,200
your work already, right?

1032
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
That doesn't count.

1033
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,240
She wouldn't

1034
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,960
look at it properly.

1035
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,560
In her eyes,

1036
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,520
I used to be a bad student,

1037
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,880
and now I'm a bad woman.

1038
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,240
Forget about it.

1039
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,400
Forget about what?

1040
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,960
What do you mean?

1041
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,680
I want to give up.

1042
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,280
What are you giving up?

1043
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,240
Let me ask you.

1044
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,240
If now

1045
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,320
Wu San is the one sitting opposite to you,

1046
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,280
what do you think he will do?

1047
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,040
He will work on it

1048
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,840
without hesitation.

1049
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,480
You taught me before

1050
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,640
about men

1051
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,280
and women.

1052
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,360
Today, it is my turn

1053
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,080
to give you a lecture.

1054
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,040
Drink this first.

1055
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
Before this, you always said that

1056
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,760
you always had

1057
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,560
bad luck in your relationships,

1058
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,840
and met some unreliable men.

1059
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,720
Why was it so?

1060
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,880
Because when you meet a problem,

1061
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,160
you never try to solve it.

1062
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,040
The problem will always be there

1063
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,880
once you don't solve it.

1064
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,840
I even said that others are not reliable.

1065
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,040
I think I am pretty

1066
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,800
unreliable too.

1067
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,240
Who said you are not reliable?

1068
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,160
Who said you are not reliable?

1069
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,400
You tell me, I'll go beat him up.

1070
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,240
I think you are reliable.

1071
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,400
And you are becoming more and more reliable.

1072
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,720
Tell me.

1073
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,200
Before you met Ms Tian,

1074
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
you and Wu San

1075
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,960
quarreled every day,

1076
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,360
always had a fight for nothing.

1077
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Now,

1078
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,160
you both are so overwhelmed

1079
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,040
by love.

1080
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,800
What does this mean?

1081
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
This means that

1082
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,240
impediment leads to motivation.

1083
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,520
Only when there is a challenge,
there is a breakthrough.

1084
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,160
Right?

1085
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
You should thank

1086
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,040
Ms Tian.

1087
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,520
You both are so in love with each other.

1088
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,760
I can't even believe it

1089
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,080
if I didn't witness the situation that day.

1090
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,880
You can become like that,

1091
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,360
Qin Qing?

1092
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,600
You are quite persuasive.

1093
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,440
Don't just give up so easily.

1094
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
She hasn't really given you a challenge.

1095
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,000
You are going to give up already.

1096
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
This is unfair to Wu San.

1097
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,760
I believe we will

1098
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,040
find the breakthrough of Ms Tian.

1099
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,120
Do you believe it?

1100
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,240
I believe it if you are with me.

1101
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,760
I am always with you.
