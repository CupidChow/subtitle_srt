that Wu San was so busy,

what is

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
so noticeable about me?

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,720
be noticeable to me?

177
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,080
I see.

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
Mrs Su didn't come today

179
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
just to customize clothes.

180
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,240
I get it now.

181
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,520
To be honest to Mrs Su,

182
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,320
President Su has helped me a lot,

183
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,840
he recognized my talent.

184
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm very thankful that

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,920
he gave me the chance

186
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
to put my thoughts in action.

187
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,760
That's it?

188
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,880
That's it.

189
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,600
I heard that

190
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,960
you are Song Lin's girlfriend.

191
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,280
Yes.

192
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,160
A girl with your personality

193
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,320
should be

194
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,760
pretty popular among boys.

195
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,040
Actually,

196
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,080
as long as my boyfriend likes me,

197
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,640
that's enough.

198
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,520
You don't believe me?

199
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,720
I believe you.

200
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,560
I've never doubted you.

201
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,880
I came here today to see

202
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,000
what kind of person he gave

203
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Si Yue's building to.

204
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Mrs Su, I think

205
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,000
President Su definitely

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,040
cares about you a lot.

207
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
Even other people like us

208
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
can tell obviously.

209
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
A few days ago in Milan,

210
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
he purposely went to the jewelry exhibition

211
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,200
to select jewelry for you.

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,680
Have you received it?

213
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,800
I received it.

214
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,080
Every festival and anniversary,

215
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,800
he would buy jewelry for me.

216
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Mr Su really loves me a lot.

217
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,320
Let's not talk about this anymore.

218
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,360
Are there other designs?

219
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,520
Let me have a look.

220
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
Here are some fabrics.

221
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,520
You can have a look.

222
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Okay.

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
They are seasonal.

224
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,280
This trip to the United States

225
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
went pretty smoothly.

226
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
Go back and have a good rest.

227
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,120
The investment fund

228
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
will come in within these two days.

229
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,200
This time,

230
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
thanks to you.

231
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,720
I really have to thank you.

232
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,600
Let's not say

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
such empty words.

234
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
They're not edible or usable.

235
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,520
Look at you.

236
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,880
If there's anything you want to eat or use,

237
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,680
tell me.

238
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,560
Not a problem.

239
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,960
As if I don't eat out enough

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
all year round.

241
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,200
If you really want to thank me,

242
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,520
cook a good homemade meal

243
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,880
by yourself to reward

244
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
your hero, me.

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,760
What? I cook?

246
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,120
Why? You're not willing to?

247
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,480
You're so smart.

248
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
You should master it very fast.

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,920
Moreover,

250
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,400
the things I want to eat are very simple.

251
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,120
Braised pork, pickled bamboo shoots,

252
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
and sweet and sour fish.

253
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,280
Tell me. You quit

254
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,520
for my small company.

255
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Do you regret it?

256
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,760
Don't flatter yourself, okay?

257
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,800
The reason I left

258
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,920
the previous company

259
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,680
is because

260
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,000
their decision panel

261
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,000
had doubts about

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
my business judgement.

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,240
This is something

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
I can never tolerate.

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,560
Plus, my collaboration with you

266
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
has its financial return.

267
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,240
Only hard cash feels real.

268
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
But the only thing

269
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,040
I can do is the investing section.

270
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,280
The rest

271
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,320
depends on your team.

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,760
Don't worry about this.

273
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,280
I'll send you back first.

274
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,560
Send President Ling back home first.

275
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
It's okay, Mister.

276
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,760
My house is too far.

277
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,520
Send him back first.

278
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
I'll feel sorry about that.

279
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,520
Don't.

280
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,640
I'll take a nap first.

281
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,640
You've worked hard for the past two days.

282
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,760
You've worked hard too.

283
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,720
Have some rest.

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
Thank you for this time.

285
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
How did you know I came back?

286
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,040
I'll get going.

287
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,160
Bye.

288
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
You came to pick me up?

289
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,120
I heard from others.

290
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,440
This time, I left in a hurry.

291
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,560
I didn't get to tell you.

292
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,560
But let me tell you

293
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,280
good news.

294
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I've sold the shares.

295
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,080
All of the shares.

296
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,320
The problem is solved,

297
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,520
so the company is saved.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,560
Song Lin.

299
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,160
I know you don't want to share with me

300
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,200
about your work,

301
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
but you should at least talk to me

302
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,240
about private matters.

303
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,280
For example, where you're going?

304
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,440
Who you're going with?

305
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
For how many days? When are you coming back?

306
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,800
As your girlfriend,

307
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
I have the right to know about these.

308
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,880
You know that day,

309
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,920
I went to your company for you.

310
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,480
Zuo Yu Lin told me,

311
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,560
you went to the United States with her.

312
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Do you know how I felt?

313
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,400
And for the past three days,

314
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,680
aside from that message,

315
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
you didn't contact me at all.

316
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,400
It's too cold.

317
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,520
Let's go back and talk. Okay?

318
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Let's go.

319
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,920
Song Lin.

320
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,360
If you continue to

321
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,320
ignore my feelings,

322
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
I think our relationship

323
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
can't last any longer.

324
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,920
Grandma.

325
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Ya Ya.

326
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,120
I miss you.

327
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,920
This weekend, come back to visit Grandma
if you have time, okay?

328
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,640
Okay. Then I...

329
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,440
I'll go back today. Okay?

330
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Okay, okay.

331
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,720
I'll hang up now.

332
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,040
That's the story.

333
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,680
I think I get what you said.

334
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,520
About this...

335
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,120
If it was back then,

336
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,320
I'd definitely be angrier than you.

337
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,880
You know my personality.

338
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,320
You don't even have to say,

339
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,320
I would've found Song Lin

340
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,920
to teach him a lesson.

341
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,240
But recently,

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,720
after experiencing

343
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
the matter with Ms Tian,

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,800
I realized that

345
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,480
for two people who love each other

346
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,600
to get together,

347
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,400
it's really not easy.

348
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,680
So,

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,280
when we face problems,

350
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,920
we have to be calmer.

351
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,840
Actually, I'm not angry about

352
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,440
who he went with

353
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,240
or where he went.

354
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
What I'm angry about is

355
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,320
why he never told me anything

356
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
before all this happened.

357
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,720
If I didn't go to the company that day

358
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,080
and bump into Zuo Yu Lin,

359
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,880
I wouldn't even know

360
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
that he went to the United States.

361
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,760
He has been doing this recently.

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,040
Whether it's about work

363
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,320
or his daily life,

364
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
he doesn't tell me anything.

365
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,840
If we continue

366
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,160
not to communicate,

367
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm really worried that

368
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,560
the distance between us

369
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
will get farther.

370
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
Tell me. If this

371
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
happened to you,

372
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,200
wouldn't you be angry?

373
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
I would be angry.

374
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,640
Of course, I would be angry.

375
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,680
But I think this situation

376
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,480
is a bit different.

377
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
I think Song Lin didn't tell you

378
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,840
because

379
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,080
he didn't want to get you involved

380
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
in the competition

381
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,760
between him and Su Yu Shan.

382
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,360
He didn't want you

383
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,640
to be stuck in between.

384
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,600
Actually, I know.

385
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,240
He wanted to protect me.

386
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
He didn't want my work

387
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
to get affected.

388
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,200
But I also want him to know that

389
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
as his girlfriend,

390
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,440
I can help share his burden.

391
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,800
Even if it's to listen to his worries,

392
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,560
it's fine.

393
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,080
I also want him to know that

394
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,520
I need him.

395
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,320
I can be by his side.

396
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,520
He is protected.

397
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,000
He can feel safe.

398
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,160
I understand.

399
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,120
What I said to him just now

400
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,480
might have been too harsh.

401
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,520
What should I do?

402
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,320
Look for him. Send him a message.

403
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:08,960
It's him?

404
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,480
He said he's at his grandmother's house.

405
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,720
At his grandmother's house...

406
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,720
Go and meet him.

407
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,000
Director Wang.

408
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,440
Sister-in-law!

409
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,840
Why are you here?

410
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,840
Song Lin's not here today.

411
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,680
It's okay. I'm looking for you.

412
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Sure. Have a seat.

413
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay.

414
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,400
Why did you look for me?

415
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,640
Any questions?

416
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,160
I promise to tell you about all I know

417
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
without reserve.

418
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,040
Here.

419
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,920
Thank you.

420
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,320
Do you know where is Song Lin's

421
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,920
grandmother's house?

422
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,680
What do you want to do? Go to see him?

423
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,320
I'll send you the address.

424
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,120
Okay.

425
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
My buddy

426
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
has been outstanding since young.

427
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,720
He's used to being proud and arrogant.

428
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,960
But this time,

429
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,240
his pride was

430
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,960
really hurt.

431
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,160
His pride was hurt?

432
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,560
I've sent you the address.

433
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,440
Okay.

434
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,200
Let's put it this way.

435
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,160
He...

436
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
feels that you don't

437
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,640
need him,

438
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,120
as if he's not needed,

439
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,880
he can be replaced at any time.

440
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,120
He's always not needed.

441
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,840
Maybe he's not used to that.

442
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
Is that how he thinks?

443
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,360
He must have

444
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
done something wrong.

445
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,360
As for you, please be forgiving.

446
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
Don't get annoyed.

447
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,880
Please bear with him.

448
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,720
Honestly

449
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,280
he's the only buddy I have.

450
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,120
Please and thank you.

451
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,280
Grandma.

452
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Don't keep working

453
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,160
in the field.

454
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,120
You're old now. Don't injure yourself.

455
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,640
If you really want to eat

456
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,200
your own vegetables,

457
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
I'll hire two workers

458
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,120
to work for you, okay?

459
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,960
Hire two workers?

460
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Grandma enjoys

461
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,160
working on my own.

462
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,960
There's no point buying vegetables.

463
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,880
What happened?

464
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,400
Did you sprain your back?

465
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,720
Look, I said it just now.

466
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,200
Hurry and go back.

467
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,920
Leave this to me.

468
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,040
There are still so many leaves

469
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,720
to tidy up.

470
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,880
Don't worry, I'll do it.

471
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
Okay. I'll go back first.

472
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,400
Go back. Go back.

473
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,160
I'll go and cook for you.

474
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,760
Okay.

475
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,120
If you're tired,

476
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,440
go back home and rest.

477
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,360
I'll go back if I'm tired.

478
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,920
Okay.

479
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,680
Go down slowly.

480
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,160
No problem.

481
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,040
Hurry and go back.

482
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,840
Okay.

483
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,600
Hello, Grandma.

484
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,520
Hello.

485
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,280
Do you know

486
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,200
the person living here?

487
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,480
Yes.

488
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Is there someone

489
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,920
called Song Lin here?

490
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,680
Song Lin?

491
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,480
That boy is in the vegetable field.

492
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,720
Where is the vegetable field?

493
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,080
You

494
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,960
walk along this path towards that side

495
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,120
and you'll see it.

496
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
Okay. Thank you, Grandma.

497
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,280
Song Lin.

498
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
Are you still angry?

499
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,600
Seeing you,

500
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,520
I can't get angry.

501
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,880
Then I guess it's useful

502
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,640
to be good-looking.

503
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,980
♪ Patches of colors, dancing fingertips ♪

504
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,980
♪ Everything is craving for the side of your face ♪

505
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,180
♪ The wind stopped, the insects quieted down
But my breath is getting faster ♪

506
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
When I was young, I really liked to

507
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,160
play at Grandma's house.

508
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,880
I'd rushed to come here during the holidays.

509
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
What did you normally

510
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,200
play here?

511
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
There are lots to play with.

512
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Climbing trees, climbing walls.

513
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
Going out and picking

514
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
the apples of the neighbors.

515
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,080
You were so naughty when you were young.

516
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,080
Were you been beaten before?

517
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,680
Back then, there were

518
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
a lot of kids here.

519
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,800
Every time I was here, I would

520
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,640
ask them out to play.

521
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,360
Going to the water reservoir together.

522
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,760
Climbing the sand piles together.

523
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,880
Poking ant nests.

524
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
When we came back after getting into trouble,

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,920
they'd get beaten at home.

526
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,960
I would go back home

527
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,880
and Grandma would cook something good.

528
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,880
Your grandmother surely loves you.

529
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,840
She loves me a lot.

530
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
How old is your grandmother?

531
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,760
Does she live here alone

532
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,440
normally?

533
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,680
There are relatives here

534
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,200
taking care of her.

535
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
She's old now.

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,760
She can't do a lot of things

537
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,400
on her own.

538
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,880
I wanted to bring her

539
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,560
to live in the city.

540
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
But she doesn't want to.

541
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
She said the air is better here.

542
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,480
It's quieter.

543
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,520
And she has her own vegetable field.

544
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
She can plant vegetables

545
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,160
and eat whatever she planted.

546
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,840
Old people are like that.

547
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,960
They prefer

548
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
natural places.

549
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,680
Maybe she's used to

550
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,240
being here.

551
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,280
Grandma went back to cook.

552
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,520
I'll bring you back to

553
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,080
meet her later.

554
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,720
She probably wants to meet

555
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,520
my girlfriend too.

556
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,320
Song Lin.

557
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
I neglected your feelings

558
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,320
because of my work before.

559
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm sorry.

560
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,520
Don't say

561
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,320
sorry to me.

562
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,120
Everyone would be

563
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,480
in a bad mood.

564
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Arguing with you

565
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
was also because I took things personally,

566
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,480
and got myself into a dead end.

567
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,040
What do you think

568
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,200
we keep arguing about?

569
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,160
Isn't it because I care about you?

Let me introduce her to you.

592
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,880
Grandma.

593
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
Let me introduce her to you.

594
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,680
This is Grandma.

595
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,120
This is...

596
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,640
Just now, you...

597
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,280
Just now what?

598
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,240
Just now, Grandma showed me

599
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,800
the direction.

600
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,760
You're not going to introduce formally?

601
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,480
Of course, I will. Aren't I'm doing it now?

602
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,040
This is Zhou Fang,

603
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,680
my girlfriend.

604
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,080
Hello, Grandma.

605
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,160
Good, good.

606
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,240
Hurry and sit.

607
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm not sure whether the dishes

608
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
suit your taste.

609
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,480
Yes, they do. I'm not picky with food.

610
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
What a good girl.

611
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,560
Here. The soup is here.

612
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,280
Auntie Zhao.

613
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,960
Grandma Song.

614
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,400
Who is this? So pretty.

615
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,240
Our granddaughter-in-law.

616
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,680
Really?

617
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,240
Let me introduce.

618
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,360
This is Auntie Zhao.

619
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,960
This is Zhou Fang.

620
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,360
Hello, Auntie Zhao. I'm Zhou Fang.

621
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,480
Grandma, you're so blessed.

622
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,360
Ya Ya is the one who is blessed.

623
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,400
He found such a good wife.

624
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,480
Ya Ya?

625
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:23,920
Yes.

626
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,400
Ya Ya?

627
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,080
Pet name.

628
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,440
When he was young, he didn't grow teeth.

629
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,080
So, we gave him a pet name.

630
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,720
So, you're Song Ya Ya?

631
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,520
Hurry and eat.

632
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,400
That's so cute.

633
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,320
Here, here.

634
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,440
Oh, right, little girl.

635
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,800
It's your first time here,

636
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,360
I didn't have the time

637
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
to prepare a gift for you.

638
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,520
This one is for you.

639
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,080
No, Grandma. It's okay.

640
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,040
I didn't bring anything

641
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,760
for you either.

642
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
Really, it's okay.

643
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
You don't like it?

644
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,480
No, that's not what I mean.

645
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,960
Then...

646
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,640
Come.

647
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,480
Come, good girl.

648
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,480
Put it on.

649
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,640
It looks better on you.

650
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,760
Hurry and eat.

651
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,080
Just wear it.

652
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,920
Grandma gave you that.

653
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,280
But let me tell you,

654
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,200
this bangle

655
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
has a story.

656
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
It's precious.

657
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,400
It's a gift from Grandpa.

658
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,080
Then I can't accept this.

659
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,160
Grandma, please take it back.

660
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,640
No, no.

661
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,400
Keep it, keep it.

662
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,840
It's okay.

663
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
Grandma, it's okay. Don't worry.

664
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,880
If she doesn't like me anymore,

665
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,560
I'll get it back for you.

666
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,600
You brat.

667
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
Look at this kid.

668
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,080
Hurry and eat.

669
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,840
Here. Hurry and eat.

670
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,160
What are you doing?

671
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,840
Why did you come over?

672
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,880
Grandma hasn't slept yet.

673
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,240
Don't let her know

674
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,000
that I am in your room.

675
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,120
Why are you here, Song Ya Ya?

676
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,160
Can you not call me Ya Ya?

677
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,440
I came to chat with you.

678
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
Communicate.

679
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,520
Chat about what?

680
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,520
Confession session.

681
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,160
Answer all questions.

682
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,840
No fallout.

683
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,600
No getting angry.

684
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,880
Sure. Who's going first?

685
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,600
You go first.

686
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,960
Are you ready?

687
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,560
I'm ready.

688
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,360
Do you have

689
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,640
an ex-girlfriend that you can't forget

690
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,240
even until now?

691
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,280
I don't even have an ex-girlfriend.

692
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,120
What's there to be unforgettable?

693
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't brush it off. Tell me seriously.

694
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,160
I'm not brushing it off.
I don't have an ex-girlfriend.

695
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll pinch you.

696
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,200
This...

697
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,000
Once broken up, a girlfriend

698
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
is just another stranger.

699
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,640
I don't miss or think about her.

700
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,400
There won't be

701
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
any trace left in my life.

702
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
That's cold.

703
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,280
It's either I'm cold

704
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,200
or I do you wrong.

705
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,920
Choose one.

706
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,600
Fine. You win.

707
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,880
Your turn to ask.

708
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm going to ask now.

709
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,800
Then...

710
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,960
What?

711
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,880
I'll ask something

712
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,160
that I don't really

713
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,120
want to know

714
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,800
but I'm curious about.

715
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,200
Please go through your

716
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,880
relationship history.

717
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,520
That's a big question.

718
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,600
How big is that?

719
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,640
How rich is your history?

720
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,840
Fine. I'll confess.

721
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,760
When I was in my first year
of university, I had a crush on

722
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,080
Huo Chen Dong.

723
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,080
Who? Who did you have a crush on?

724
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,680
Face towards me.

725
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,120
Didn't you say there was nothing between you two?

726
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,640
Didn't you say there was nothing between you two?

727
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,200
There was nothing between us.

728
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,560
How is this nothing?

729
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
I only had a crush on him

730
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
for a short time in university.

731
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,800
A few months.

732
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,240
I even let you have a meal with him.

733
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,560
How big-hearted can I be?

734
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,360
I came clean to him

735
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,280
when we ate together.

736
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,200
We are just bros now.

737
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,960
You two still talk

738
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,720
about this until now?

739
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,440
Can you cut it out?

740
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,600
We've cut it out.

741
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,240
What?

742
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,080
We've gone over the matter

743
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,520
with your ex-girlfriend.

744
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,120
We can't go over

745
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,040
the matter with my crush?

746
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,520
Yes, we can.

747
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,000
Then I'll continue.

748
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,640
After that?

749
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,400
After that,

750
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,840
there was too much coursework in university,

751
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
so I wasn't in a relationship.

752
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,920
After I graduated and

753
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,200
came back from overseas,

754
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,800
I met Wang Ze Yang.

755
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
Your life has been

756
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,480
pretty rough.

757
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,320
You can skip Wang Ze Yang.

758
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,280
I know everything.

759
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,360
After that...

760
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,360
It's me.

761
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,800
Now that you said it,

762
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,720
my relationship history

763
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,760
isn't that rich.

764
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,240
It's alright. You have three.

765
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
That's the standard answer.

766
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,240
Fine. My turn to ask.

767
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,200
Ask then.

768
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,000
How expensive is this bangle?

769
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,320
If I break it,

770
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
can I afford to pay for it?

771
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,400
You definitely can't afford it.

772
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
You can only pay me back

773
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,200
with the rest of your life.

774
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,040
Then I have to be careful.

775
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,720
Be careful of what? You don't want to pay me back?

776
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,880
You said

777
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,120
it'll cost the rest of my life.

778
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,480
Of course, I have to be careful.

779
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,400
I need to keep it when I get back.

780
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,200
The rest of your life

781
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
has nothing to do with it.

782
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay?

783
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,240
You can't leave me anyway.

784
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
We'll have to be together no matter what.

785
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,520
It's you who can't leave me.

786
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
It doesn't matter who can't leave the other.

787
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,360
The point is we will be together.

788
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,440
Right?

789
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,600
Right.

790
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,720
You know...

791
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,960
It's almost time now.

792
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,720
Uhm...

793
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
Grandma has seen you as well.

794
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,280
Don't you think

795
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,400
it's time to take me in?

796
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,640
Your words

797
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,960
do make sense.

798
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,600
Let me think.

799
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
Indeed, we should

800
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,320
go by the book...

801
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,840
And get a certificate, right?

802
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,800
I knew it.

803
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
Get a certificate for Ya Ya.

804
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
Get what certificate for Ya Ya?

805
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,400
In my residential area,

806
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,360
there was a white puppy

807
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
with the name Ya Ya.

808
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
What certificate do you think?

809
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,960
Were you bitten by it before?

810
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,920
No...

811
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,000
Were you bitten by it before?

812
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,760
Little girl, have you kept Luo Luo's drawing?

813
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
I kept it. Don't worry.

814
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,960
I've put it in the box.

815
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Okay.

816
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
What secret are you talking about?

817
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,400
The secret that

818
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,000
you can't know about.

819
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,560
Grandma, you two have

820
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,160
secrets now?

821
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,680
Of course, there are secrets

822
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,320
between girls.

823
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,120
It's good that you have.

824
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,240
Okay, okay.

825
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,880
You two should make a move.

826
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,600
It's going to be

827
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
another three to four hours on the road.

828
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:02,920
Okay.

829
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,840
Grandma,

830
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I'll come back every month

831
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,480
to visit you.

832
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,720
Okay.

833
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
Do your things first,

834
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,720
and come when you have time.

835
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,440
Grandma always welcomes you.

836
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,760
Don't worry, go. Go.

837
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,360
Go and stay with me

838
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,840
in Shanghai.

839
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,400
Grandma likes here, that it's quiet.

840
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,200
Grandma, we'll go back then.

841
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,320
We will come back

842
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,120
to visit you.

843
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
If you miss us,

844
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
just call us.

845
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,200
We'll come and pick you up.

846
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
Don't worry.

847
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,120
As long as you two are fine,

848
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,840
Grandma is happy.

849
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,520
Go, go.

850
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,920
Take care of yourself.

851
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,040
Call me if anything.

852
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,840
Okay.

853
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,440
Treat her well.

854
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
Don't worry. Don't worry.

855
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,560
Go. Hurry and go.

856
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,240
Hurry and go back in.

857
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,720
Okay.

858
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,840
We'll go back now, Grandma.

859
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,920
Take care.

860
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,320
Hello, Lin?

861
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
Hello, Zuo.

862
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,120
There's something

863
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,200
I need to talk to you.

864
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,480
What? Tell me.

865
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,640
Ask Qin Qing out for me.

866
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,520
I want to meet her.

867
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,920
Please enjoy.

868
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,440
Thank you.

869
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,360
What's the matter?

870
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,360
A serious matter.

871
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,960
I want to give Zhou Fang a surprise.

872
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,440
So I need to look for

873
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,320
her bestie,

874
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,200
her best friend

875
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,280
to seek advice and help.

876
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,440
Surprise?

877
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,400
You're putting some effort.

878
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
But let me tell you.

879
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,520
I know your relationship

880
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,640
is doing pretty good now

881
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,280
and you do treat her pretty well.

882
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,920
When my dad was sick,

883
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,200
you also helped out quite a bit.

884
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,600
I know you're

885
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,440
a loyal friend.

886
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,240
But that's not the same thing.

887
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,920
You hurt Zhou Fang before.

888
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,920
That's a fact.

889
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,040
Don't ever forget it.

890
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
If in the future,

891
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,920
there's any sign of disturbance

892
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
or cheating,

893
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,120
I'll have you know,

894
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,880
I will make a fuss.

895
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,520
Stop making a fuss.

896
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,520
There won't be any cheating.

897
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,760
As for disturbance,

898
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,320
we can use

899
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,160
a bit of that.

900
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,080
What do you want to do?

901
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,239
I want to marry her.

902
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,840
So, the surprise you mentioned is

903
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,360
you want to propose to her?

904
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
I want to marry her.

905
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,520
Will you be good to her forever?

906
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Of course.

907
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,480
Say it. What do you want me to do?

Fu,

912
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,520
have you tidied up the workbench?

913
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Customers will come in a bit.

Not yet.

915
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,840
It looks more realistic if messy.

916
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,880
It doesn't need to be realistic today.

917
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,760
Hurry and tidy it up.

Okay. We'll go in first.

932
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,800
Sure.

933

Your place is pretty good.

Not bad, right?

941
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,920
You have a good eye for location.

942
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,000
Mom, if you want to praise me,
praise me straightly.

943
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,840
Why are you so reserved?

944
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,000
If I praise you straight,

945
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,920
you might get arrogant.

946
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,240
I won't.

947
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,160
Are Song Lin and Wu San here?

948
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,040
They're inside.

00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,640
What's up? Why are you looking at me?

950
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,200
Nothing.

in then.

our beautiful President Zhou to give a speech.

Thank you

975
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
for coming to our

976
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,400
experience store today.

977
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,280
As you can see,

978
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,240
this isn't a formal

979
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,200
opening ceremony.

980
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,360
It's just a small party.

981
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,800
I've invited the people that

982
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
I love the most,

983
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,880
that I'm closest to here

984
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,520
to take this opportunity

985
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,240
to tell everyone,

986
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
thank you so much

987
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,080
for supporting

988
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,360
and inspiring me

989
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,320
in my career and my life

990
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,960
for all this while.

991
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,480
Setting up an haute couture experience store

992
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
has always been my dream.

993
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,320
I am very honored

994
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,520
to witness it happening

995
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,280
with everyone here.

996
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Now, I'd like to announce that

997
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,400
our experience store

998
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,360
is officially open.

999
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,480
Thank you, everyone.

1000
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,120
This is my new office.

1001
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,600
How is it? Not bad, right?

1002
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,760
Pretty good.

1003
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,720
You put the wardrobe I gifted you here.

1004
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,080
What do you think? Do you like it?

1005
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,080
Yes, I do.

1006
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
It must have cost quite a lot.

1007
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,800
Your works are important.

1008
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,040
The cost of it doesn't matter.

1009
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,040
Thank you on behalf of

1010
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,680
my works then.

1011
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,160
You're drinking? Still drinking?

1012
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,720
I'm in a bad mood.

1013
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,320
What happened?

1014
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,000
How is it going with your boyfriend?

1015
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,080
My boyfriend and I

1016
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,840
are doing good.

1017
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,080
It's just that Ms Tian,

1018
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,440
she still doesn't agree

1019
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,680
that Wu San and I are together.

1020
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
She still doesn't accept me.

1021
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,240
Why?

1022
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,320
I think maybe it's because

1023
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,120
Ms Tian raised her son up

1024
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,160
all on her own.

1025
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,120
So, the love she has

1026
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,840
towards her son

1027
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,240
would be much stronger

1028
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,920
compared with other mothers.

1029
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,200
Much more special.

1030
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,040
And Wu San

1031
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,280
has been an obedient kid

1032
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,440
ever since he was small.

1033
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,000
Throughout this period,

1034
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,120
being together with Wu San,

1035
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,760
I know it well that

1036
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,320
I want to be with him

1037
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,840
forever.

1038
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
I will never give up.

1039
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,560
Of course, you can't give up.

1040
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
You finally found someone

1041
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,920
you're in love with.

1042
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,120
Why should you give up?

1043
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,440
Uhm...

1044
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,640
Get your parents

1045
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,680
to talk to her.

1046
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,280
My mom

1047
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,520
couldn't really accept Wu San either.

1048
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,200
She felt that

1049
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,320
he was younger than me.

1050
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
Would he be reliable?

1051
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,320
Would he be dependable?

1052
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,920
But during this period,

1053
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,080
she slowly accepted

1054
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Wu San.

1055
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,480
As for my dad,

1056
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
he just had surgery, just got out of the hospital.

1057
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,800
A lot of things

1058
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,720
happened at home.

1059
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,920
At this timing,

1060
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,160
I don't want to

1061
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,880
make them worry.

1062
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,360
So...

1063
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,080
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

1064
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,560
Let's not give up.

1065
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,320
It's hard to find someone

1066
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,720
whom you like.

1067
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,440
Both of you are in love.

1068
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Why should you give up?

1069
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,200
Don't give up.

1070
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,200
Don't give up.

1071
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,160
The thing is...

1072
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,360
You know sometimes

1073
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,240
I see Wu San

1074
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,720
getting stuck between me and Ms Tian.

1075
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,920
It's hard for him.

1076
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,080
I feel sorry for him,

1077
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,000
but I don't know

1078
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
what to do.

1079
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,800
I...

1080
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,320
You...The Ms Tian that

1081
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,240
you mentioned.

1082
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,200
Which school is she from? No.1 Middle School?

1083
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,560
No.1 Middle School?

1084
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:25,960
Okay.

1085
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
I'll go and find out.

1086
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,040
You have a solution?

1087
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,000
What solution can I have?

1088
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,400
But

1089
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
you have to trust me.

1090
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,040
Trust Auntie.

1091
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,200
You two are doing good.

1092
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,360
Let's not give up.

1093
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,600
Don't worry about this.

1094
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,960
Let me... Let me think of a solution.

1095
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,280
I'll think of a solution.

1096
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
You saw Wu San just now.

1097
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,600
What do you think?

1098
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,480
Is he good?

1099
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,160
Lin Lin, what time is it now?

1100
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,680
Why are you still working?

1101
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,960
Go to bed.

1102
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,120
Mom.

1103
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
I want to move back there tomorrow.

1104
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
No.

1105
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,720
Didn't I tell you?

1106
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,000
I've been feeling unwell recently.

1107
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Leaving me alone

1108
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,840
at home,

1109
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,680
won't you be worried?

1110
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,240
Mom, you haven't taken your medicine yet.

1111
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,400
I'll get medicine for you.

1112
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
[Message from Qin Qing]

1113
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Mom, are you feeling unwell?

1114
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,400
It's okay.

1115
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,440
How about we go and check

1116
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,080
at the hospital?

1117
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,760
It's okay.

1118
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,720
It may get better after I take some medicine.
