351
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,360
is a bit troublesome.

352
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,600
No worries.

353
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,680
We can have our outing at any time.

354
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,880
Your work is the most important now.

355
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,680
It's our first date.

356
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,480
Do you feel a bit disappointed?

357
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,360
Of course, there's a bit of disappointment.

358
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,680
But we'll see how you

359
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,560
make up to me next time.

360
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay then.

361
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,880
Go back.

362
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,480
I'll go in now.

363
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,320
Go.

364
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,960
Bye.

365
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,640
It feels good overall.

366
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,560
But can the waistline

367
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,840
be taken in a bit more?

368
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,640
Miss Zhou!

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,560
I'm sorry. What did you say just now?

370
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,920
Waistline.

371
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,600
Is there something

372
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,480
bothering you?

373
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,880
Let's take care of what is in front of us first.

374
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm sorry.

375
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,760
Let me have a look.

376
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
Did you get slimmer again recently?

377
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,880
The measurement

378
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,640
is a bit different from

379
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
what we measured before.

380
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,600
Okay. I'll take in from both sides.

381
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,200
Please have a look. It's like this.

382
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,720
Right?

383
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
I think, taking in the waistline

384
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
can accentuate my figure more.

385
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,440
I've always heard that

386
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,040
TKY Haute Couture

387
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,880
is good in your work and is reasonably priced.

388
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,960
It's true.

389
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,360
Look at this gown.

390
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
The quality is so good.

391
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,200
Although it doesn't cost ten thousand yuan,

392
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,200
compared with those

393
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,240
big international brands,

394
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,200
there's no difference.

395
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,520
Thank you.

396
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
You've worn so many garments

397
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
from big brands before

398
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,400
and still, you're willing

399
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,120
to choose ours.

400
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,160
Your recognition

401
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,120
is our honor.

402
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,320
Ever since your time in the competition,

403
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,200
I took notice of you.

404
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,480
You're full of ideas.

405
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,720
Furthermore,

406
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,040
you're very different

407
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
from the other designers.

408
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,120
I think your designs are

409
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,400
especially low key,

410
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
not over the top at all.

411
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,960
Actually, I think that

412
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,720
if the designs are

413
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,000
added with a lot of ideas,

414
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,720
the main design

415
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
might get overshadowed.

416
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,080
Hence, I'm more willing to

417
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,120
put my design inspiration

418
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
into details.

419
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
This is also what I pursue.

420
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,280
Having style yet low key at the same time.

421
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
This is very high-class.

422
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,680
You know what?

423
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,040
We celebrities

424
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,640
are often compared with each other.

425
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,040
The last thing we want is to be similar.

426
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,280
Whether it's to others

427
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
or ourselves in the past.

428
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
That's why your design concept

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,920
is very good.

430
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
It exhibits one's actual self.

431
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,880
I like it a lot.

432
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,920
In the future,

433
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,800
I'll introduce my friends

434
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,400
to come here often.

435
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Thank you very much for that.

436
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, right,

437
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,560
this is a gift for you.

I hope you like it.

How sweet.

440
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,560
I'll accept it happily then.

Yes, it is.

00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,960
Okay.

526
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,360
Let's go.

527
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,840
Go.

528
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,640
Sorry to trouble you

529
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,600
to come so far.

530
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,280
Don't mention it.

531
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,880
You don't have to see us off.

532
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,960
Please take care too.

533
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,200
Okay. Then, you

534
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,960
drive safely.

535
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,640
Don't worry.

536
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
We'll visit you again

537
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,080
in a few days.

538
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,880
Okay.

539
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
Be careful on the road.

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,200
Sure. You go in.

541
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,720
Auntie, goodbye.

542
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
-Sure, sure.
-I won't walk you out then.

543
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,040
Okay. Get back in.

544
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,960
Okay. Goodbye.

545
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Look at your Auntie Qin.

546
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,080
She likes you so much.

547
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
Visit them more often when you have time.

548
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,280
Take some load off of Qing.

549
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,840
I know.

550
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,160
When your Uncle Qin is out of the hospital,

551
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,920
I'll talk to them

552
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,360
about the marriage of you and Qing.

553
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,480
As parents,

554
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
we all hope that you two can

555
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,960
get married and have children soon.

556
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,080
Mom, what are you talking about?

557
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,040
Let's talk at home.

558
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,720
Sure.

559
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,040
What now?

560
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,560
What's the problem?

561
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,320
Lin.

562
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Qin Qing and I will

563
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,760
really be over soon.

564
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,040
Relationship problems again?

565
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
Relationship problems

566
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
are always clearer
from an outsider's perspective.

567
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,000
But when it happens on you,

568
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,520
you can't pass it.

569
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,560
There's no other way.

570
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,760
You have to experience this.

571
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,280
Don't take it too hard.

572
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,280
Come on.

573
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,840
Lin, I still want to drink.

574
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Drink. Drink.

575
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,640
I'm not drunk.

576
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,560
Qin Qing doesn't want me.

577
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,760
Here, here, here.

578
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,000
Qin Qing, she doesn't want me.

579
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
Here.

580
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
Qin Qing.

581
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,880
Bro, I like Qin Qing.

582
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,240
Oh, my!

583
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,760
That's thrilling.

584
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,600
What's thrilling? He drank too much.

585
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,160
Others bring back girls,

586
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,480
while you brought back a man.

587
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,600
What's up?

588
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,560
Isn't... Isn't this Brother Wu San?

589
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,080
What happened to him?

590
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,200
He hit the wall with his relationship.

591
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,640
What a bum.

592
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,880
Who hit the wall with his relationship?

593
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
Baffled and puzzled,

594
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,080
tortuous and tangled,

595
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,080
untamed and ferocious.

596
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,680
I... I couldn't find you.

597
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,800
Brother Wu San,

598
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
your language skill is pretty good.

599
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,440
Who couldn't you find?

600
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,640
Qin Qing.

601
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,880
I couldn't find Qin Qing.

602
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,720
Broke up?

603
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Find Qin Qing for me.

604
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,040
It's okay if you broke up.

605
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,520
Time can make you

606
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
forget all pains.

607
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,320
Stop blabbering.

608
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,000
Go to sleep.

609
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
Look. My brother's so good to you.

610
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,280
Hurry and go to sleep.

611
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm not done talking yet!

612
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,880
Goodnight!

613
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,920
The trash can is beside the bed.

614
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,880
Don't throw up on the bed.

615
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,680
Have you heard me?

616
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
There's water on the table.

617
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,280
Qin Qing.

618
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
Qin Qing.

619
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,840
Qin Qing.

620
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,760
Hurry up, eat and go to school.

621
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Did you rest well last night?

622
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,960
Pretty well.

623
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,360
Caught a cold?

624
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,840
I'm good.

625
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,160
Have some breakfast.

626
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,640
Lin.

627
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,320
Come on, sit down and eat.

628
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,480
I won't disturb

629
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,000
you two eating.

630
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,640
I need to go to school.

631
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Enjoy your meal.

632
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,840
Are you full?

633
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,960
I'm full.

634
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,360
Lin.

635
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,840
Did I

636
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
trouble you again?

637
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
No big deal.

638
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
Go and take a shower. You smell stinky.

639
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,840
Take a shower and go to work.

640
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,680
I'll go now.

641
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,320
You're not eating?

642
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,600
It's okay.

643
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,400
That's my sister's room. There.

644
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,120
President Song, sorry for the wait.

645
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,440
You've worked hard.

646
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,680
These two are

647
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,200
the representatives of Nelson Capital.

648
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,640
Hello. Song Lin.

649
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Charles.

650
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,480
Chandler.

651
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,840
Hello. Please have a seat.

652
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,600
I've explained briefly

653
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,560
to Charles

654
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,760
about the details of your situation.

655
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,680
There is no

656
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,280
problem basically.

657
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,120
The main thing is Nelson Capital

658
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,160
has a bit of doubt

659
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,120
with regards to

660
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,200
the valuation

661
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,080
of your shares.

662
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,600
So, we invited both parties

663
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
to come over, sit down

664
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,480
and have a chat today.

665
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,320
If there are any doubts

666
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,120
or comments,

667
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,720
you can communicate.

668
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
I have some private matter to attend to.

669
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll excuse myself first.

670
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,960
Nice meeting you.

671
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,360
You go ahead.

672
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:57,760
Okay.

673
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,880
President Song, here is the thing.

674
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,200
For this period,

675
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,920
we have tried our best to

676
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
learn about Wan Feng Group.

677
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,320
Judging from the development of your company

678
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,560
from scratch within the past five years,

679
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,760
it is indeed a very astonishing

680
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,320
miracle.

681
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Hence,

682
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
we are pleased to

683
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,760
acquire Wan Feng Group.

684
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,120
We're also very pleased to

685
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
take this opportunity

686
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,200
to break into China's market.

687
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
But we feel that

688
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,000
your company's valuation

689
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,800
is slightly high.

690
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,440
This will increase

691
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,160
our risk of acquisition.

692
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,640
Firstly, thank you very much

693
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
for your recognition towards

694
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,200
Wan Feng Group.

695
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,600
In my opinion,

696
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,720
Wan Feng Group

697
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,920
isn't just a channel

698
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,520
to break into China's

699
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,120
internal market.

700
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,600
Wan Feng Group is also mainly responsible for

701
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,640
the export of China's designs.

702
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,880
China currently has a lot of

703
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,040
good, excellent designers

704
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,200
and original designs.

705
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,600
All these designers

706
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,920
have their own original brand,

707
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,760
which're all pretty good.

708
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,080
But these excellent designers

709
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,920
neither have

710
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,320
the platform that they deserve,

711
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,240
nor do they have

712
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,880
a design environment

713
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
that they deserve.

714
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,200
These few years, aside from

715
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,760
securing

716
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,840
our place in the local market,

717
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,640
Wan Feng has also been

718
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
exploring the overseas market.

719
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,640
For instance,

720
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,440
we have entered

721
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,280
Japan and South Korea's market.

722
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,400
I think

723
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,480
shortly,

724
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,240
the entire Asia-Pacific region

725
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,760
can be ours.

726
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,880
So, I hope that after

727
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,240
you acquire the shares,

728
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,600
you can fulfill this wish for me as well.

729
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,760
To continue

730
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,040
to help these designers

731
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
to walk out of the country and into the world.

732
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,400
If your agenda is focused on

733
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
interest and profit only,

734
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
it might go against

735
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,800
my original purpose of selling my shares.

736
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,920
President Song, I'll be honest with you.

737
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,920
The reason why we're

738
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,080
so interested in the shares of

739
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,040
Wan Feng Group

740
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,480
is really that

741
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,360
we value China's market

742
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,000
very much.

743
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,200
This might go against

744
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,320
your thoughts of exploring

745
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
the overseas market.

746
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,040
Furthermore,

747
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,120
even if we successfully acquired your shares,

748
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,240
Bai Sai

749
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,280
is still the largest majority shareholder.

750
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,480
Therefore,

751
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,480
in terms of whether to explore the overseas market,

752
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,240
we still have to

753
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
respect their decision.

754
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,320
But the main point of

755
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,840
today's agenda is

756
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,720
if you're willing to consider

757
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,280
to lower your valuation,

758
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,560
then we can

759
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,400
continue to discuss

760
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,920
other details of the agreement.

761
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,240
I think

762
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,120
our problem here

763
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,160
isn't the price.

764
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,760
It's not the problem of

765
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,920
our company's valuation.

766
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,160
I think we are

767
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,320
different in our concepts.

768
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,120
But it's okay.

769
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,040
We'll have

770
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,120
a chance to work together.

771
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,080
Alright. Thanks for today.

772
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,080
Thank you.

773
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,680
Thanks for everything.

774
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,920
Song Lin.

775
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,160
Didn't you have something on?

776
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,000
Why are you here?

777
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,280
I'm a third party.

778
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,480
Plus, I knew beforehand that

779
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,440
they wanted to push the price down.

780
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,120
I was in an awkward position.

781
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,200
So, I made up an excuse.

782
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,640
You're amazing.

783
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,800
I thought you had something on.

784
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,960
How was the discussion?

785
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,160
How was the discussion? It was...

786
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,360
Do you remember

787
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,320
what you told me last time?

788
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,240
You said

789
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,960
the overseas capital is good,

790
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,320
simple and easy,

791
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,600
There are less

792
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,000
social and human factors, right?

793
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,680
Yeah.

794
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,840
What do you mean yeah?

795
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,360
In the end, they talked about Bai Sai

796
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,240
and Su Yu Shan.

797
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,080
About this,

798
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,560
it was out of my expectation as well.

799
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,840
This time, they sent

800
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,560
a Chinese representative.

801
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,040
I can tell that

802
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,640
you tried your best.

803
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
No worries. Thanks for everything this time.

804
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,480
I'll go back and figure it out.

805
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
There's always a solution.

806
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,000
Actually,

807
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
I thought about it while I was sitting here.

808
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,440
I have a very suitable

809
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
investor candidate.

810
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
But this person

811
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,400
is famous in this circle

812
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
for having an edgy personality.

813
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,200
Most people can't handle this person.

814
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,800
Why did you think of

815
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,960
picking me up from school today?

816
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,760
Isn't this the last time?

817
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,400
Why do you have to make it sound so sad?

818
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,680
Not sad.

819
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,560
I'm just reminding you, in case you forgot it.

820
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,120
How can I forget about this?

821
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Happy now?

822
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm happy.

823
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,200
As long as you're happy.

824
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,160
The dishes today are good,

825
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,480
Congratulations, Luo Luo.

826
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,880
Who knew

827
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,920
within such a short time,

828
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,560
your grades can

829
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,360
improve so much.

830
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,840
You're a tough one. Here's for you.

831
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,480
Of course.

832
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,120
I guess it won't be long

833
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,760
before I can leave.

834
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,240
You two won't have to keep looking

835
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,080
through your balconies anymore,

836
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,480
like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl*.
(*Lit.: Chinese folk tale)

837
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,920
Just stay together.

838
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,840
Please don't bring this up.

839
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,400
I still need

840
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,200
my personal space.

841
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,200
Bro, this woman

842
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,920
doesn't love you much.

843
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,440
She wants to

844
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,080
keep distant.

845
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,120
You don't have to tell me.

846
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,120
I can tell

847
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,840
she doesn't love me much.

848
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,640
I'll think something back home.

849
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,880
But this isn't the worst.

850
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,520
My godmother

851
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,560
really doesn't like you.

852
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,640
You think it over.

853
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,280
You don't have to tell me. I know.

854
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,320
Just think about yourself.

855
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,160
Don't worry.

856
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
As long as you two are happy.

857
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,920
I'll send you over by then.

858
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,280
I'll have a look at the situation there.

859
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
Please don't.

860
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,760
Finally, I get to be free.

861
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,600
Don't follow me.

862
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,920
Wait. What's with that?

863
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,040
Everyone wants personal space now?

864
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,160
I'll leave then. okay?

865
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,360
Luo Luo.

866
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,960
When you're there,

867
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,880
take good care of yourself.

868
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,640
Stay safe. Study well.

869
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,960
As for us,

870
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,160
we'll stay here

871
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,360
and cheer you on.

872
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,480
I know.

873
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,080
You two behave the same now.

874
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,640
Seriously.

875
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,720
How dare you complain?

876
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,040
Fine.

877
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,680
Cheers.

878
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:37,960
Here.

879
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,720
Cheers,

880
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,400
I'll go back first.

881
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,920
Go.

882
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,720
So should I

883
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,560
attend the

884
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,280
dinner event?

885
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,360
How about I don't go?

886
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,640
You should go.

887
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,040
Whether you go or not,

888
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,520
it might not mean anything to other people.

889
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,240
But if you don't go,

890
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
you'll lose a chance

891
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,680
to expand your social circle.

892
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,760
Plus, you'll turn

893
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,640
Su Yu Shan down.

894
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,880
So, art exhibition and dinner event,

895
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,120
which one is more important?

896
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,200
I'm not choosing whether

897
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,960
the art exhibition or dinner event
is more important.

898
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,160
You're the most important.

899
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,480
I'm okay.

900
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,520
I have a lot of time

901
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,240
for you to make up for me.

902
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,680
Go.

903
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,120
I'll go then.

904
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,040
Mom, why did you

905
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,600
come over

906
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,280
without telling me?

907
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,440
If I didn't...

908
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
If I didn't run into it today,

909
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,080
until when do you plan to

910
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,840
hide it from me?

911
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,760
I...I was thinking of...

912
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,639
Shut up!

913
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,440
Auntie.

914
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,520
Speak!

915
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,440
I really like

916
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:47,960
Zhou Fang.

917
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,360
Both of us want to

918
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,159
be together.

919
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,320
Don't you dare think about it!

920
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
I want to go home.

921
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,480
You send me back!

922
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,960
I'll settle with you later!

923
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,600
No worries, no worries.

924
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,800
Don't be scared.

925
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll send your mom back.

926
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,520
Wait for me at home.

927
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,480
Auntie,

928
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,640
if you have any questions,

929
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,160
anything,

930
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,200
you can ask me directly.

931
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,680
Tell me.

932
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,120
Do you really like

933
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
our Zhou Fang?

934
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,640
I really like

935
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,600
Zhou Fang, Auntie.

936
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,560
Do you know my daughter well?

937
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,560
Not as well as you do.

938
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,040
But I'm in the process

939
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,280
of getting to know her more.

940
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,880
The time we spent together

941
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,000
is actually the process

942
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,160
of getting to know each other.

943
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,200
The more I know,

944
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,360
the more I realized I like her.

945
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,640
Auntie.

946
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,040
I know what you're worried about.

947
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,840
You're scared if Zhou Fang is
in a relationship with me,

948
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,280
she might get hurt.

949
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,800
Don't blame me for guarding against you.

950
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,080
The youngsters nowadays are too impulsive.

951
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,640
Splitting up and getting back together,

952
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,200
like they're playing games.

953
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,800
Some cheat whenever they want.

954
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,280
The moral standards are too low.

955
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,640
They can't restrict themselves.

956
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,800
People need to have a sense of responsibility.

957
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,280
Otherwise,

958
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
what makes us different from animals?

959
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,680
I really don't know

960
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,360
what you youngsters

961
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,320
have in mind these days.

962
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,520
Only think about liking and dating someone.

963
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,360
Never think about marriage.

964
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,160
When we're dating,

965
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,440
of course, we think about marriage, Auntie.

966
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,720
If you really thought about it,

967
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,440
you'll have to put yourself in her position.

968
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,280
If you want to be together,

969
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,720
you have to be sincere to each other。

970
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,640
Those despicable acts

971
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,360
should not be done.

972
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,800
Auntie's right.

973
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,400
Auntie, about Zhou Fang,

974
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
I am serious.

975
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,600
I've experienced so much

976
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
and have seen so much.

977
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,640
To meet Zhou Fang

978
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,960
who is really

979
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
the same inside out,

980
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,600
who is really

981
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,200
worldly yet down-to-earth.

982
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,440
It's rare.

983
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,760
I cherish her very much.

984
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,200
I also like her very much.

985
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,000
I wish that we can

986
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,680
be together for a long time.

987
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,560
And Auntie,

988
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,360
you don't have to worry.

989
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,680
Zhou Fang has experienced so much.

990
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,960
With me,

991
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
these kinds of things...

992
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,120
I will never,

993
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
I can't bear

994
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,520
to let her get hurt again, Auntie.

995
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,360
Then tell me.

996
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,000
What were those about...

997
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,560
Your ex-girlfriend,

998
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,600
your fiancée.

999
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,960
What were

1000
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,080
all those about?

1001
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,120
When did I have a fiancée?

1002
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,600
It's written on the Internet.

1003
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
It's said that you had

1004
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
a rumored girlfriend.

1005
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,560
What about that?

1006
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Auntie,

1007
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,040
this news online...

1008
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,320
Don't read it.

1009
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,560
Those reporters...

1010
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,160
took some photos

1011
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,440
and they could write anything.

1012
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,480
They dare to say anything.

1013
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
They put up misleading titles,

1014
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
trying to imply something

1015
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,840
obscurely,

1016
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
but they had nothing

1017
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,800
for a fact.

1018
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,320
They're all fake, Auntie.

1019
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,560
These things are really

1020
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,400
annoying.

1021
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,120
Well, I'm also

1022
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,120
only listening to you now.

1023
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,480
No, you... How can

1024
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,320
you prove yourself?

1025
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,320
Auntie, you want me to prove myself.

1026
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,600
But I really don't have anything

1027
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,400
that I can prove.

1028
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,480
How am I supposed to prove these things?

1029
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
All I can say is,

1030
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,520
I'll use the rest of my life

1031
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,760
to prove that

1032
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
I am sincerely in love with Zhou Fang,

1033
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,440
I sincerely like Zhou Fang.

1034
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,720
Auntie, don't worry.

1035
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,440
I'll protect Zhou Fang well.

1036
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,720
I'll protect your daughter well.

1037
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,400
Here.

1038
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
Auntie, please rest early.

1039
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,600
The weather's getting cold.

1040
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,960
You wear so thin, be careful not to catch a cold.

1041
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,280
Don't think that you're still young.

1042
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,520
You'll regret it in a couple of years.

1043
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,880
I know.

1044
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,880
Auntie, bye!

1045
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,620
[Zhou Fang's calling]

1046
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,440
Hello?

1047
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,080
I have sent your mom back.

1048
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,760
Don't worry.

1049
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,400
What did my mom say?

1050
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,560
Was she being hard on you?

1051
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,360
No, she wasn't.

1052
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,840
We chatted on our way.

1053
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,480
It was pretty good.

1054
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,600
She didn't force you to break up?

1055
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,520
No.

1056
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,280
Don't tell me she agreed?

1057
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,560
I guess so.

1058
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,080
It was a good chat

1059
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,560
anyhow.

1060
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,120
Okay, get some rest.

1061
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,080
I'll reach home soon.

1062
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,040
I'll tell you when I'm back.

1063
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,560
Sure.

1064
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,480
Bye.

1065
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,720
Out of all,

1066
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,600
I think this is

1067
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,200
still better.

1068
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,800
The fabric is nicer

1069
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
and the clothes made

1070
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,160
might have a better form.

1071
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:16,960
Right.

1072
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
But this fabric

1073
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,200
is more expensive.

1074
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,280
To customize the full set

1075
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,360
plus the labor surcharge,

1076
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,600
it'll be 30 to 40 thousand yuan.

1077
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,480
Fine. We'll do it by demand then.

1078
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,320
Let's customize a sample first,

1079
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
get the customer to try it on

1080
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,040
and see whether it's satisfying.

1081
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:30,920
Alright.

1082
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,640
Miss Fang!

1083
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,000
What's up with you?

1084
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,880
Just now,

1085
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,320
my idol's manager

1086
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,880
gave us a call!

1087
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,800
Who's your idol?

1088
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,880
It's the

1089
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,760
boy group that debuted

1090
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,080
earlier this year.

1091
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,000
The staff of their company said,

1092
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,440
they'll shoot a new music video this time

1093
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,840
and they want to use your customization.

1094
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,440
Who introduced them to us?

1095
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,920
They said President Su of Bai Sai Group

1096
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,840
introduced us to them.

1097
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,240
Miss Fang.

1098
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,080
They'll have a try-on session this time, right?

1099
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,360
Please bring me along.

1100
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,400
Okay? Please promise me.

1101
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,400
Fine, fine.

1102
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I'll bring you along.

1103
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,400
Get back to work.

1104
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,280
Okay, okay.

1105
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,800
