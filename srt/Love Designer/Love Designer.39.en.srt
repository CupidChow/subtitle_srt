Mom.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
Qin Qing is at my place.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,360
I know.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,080
Here you go.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,160
Mom.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,800
Hello?

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,040
No one answers.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
It's not your mom,
it's my mom.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,840
She's coming to you.
Hurry and get up.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,200
Wake up.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,400
Get up and wash up. Wash your face.

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,560
You wake up.

39

She's looking for you. Why should I wake up?

I can't do it. I'm having a headache.

What's the matter?

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
Didn't I promise you

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
to find out things

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120

And?

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,120
And this matter,

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
leave it all to me.

What have you been up to recently?

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,480
What can I be up to?

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm still working on my thesis.

70
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
No matter how I modify it,

71
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm still not satisfied.

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
In the next few days, attend

73
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,720
my birthday party, okay?

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,840
I kept it in mind.

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
Which of your birthday party

76
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,280
have I not attended?

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,560
Sweetheart.

78
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
I'll go downstairs

79
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
and call you later.

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,680
Okay. Goodbye.

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,880
Mom.

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,320
You said you hadn't been

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,360
feeling well for the past few days,

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
why are you using the computer now?

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
The soup that I made for you,

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,160
have you had it?

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes, I have. I finished all of it.

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,600
I'm a bit full now.

89
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
You're full with just that little amount?

90
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
That means

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,760
your gastrointestinal function

92
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,560
is still not good.

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,840
From now on, eat at home.

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
Mom will nurse you back to health.

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
I'll go downstairs for a walk.

96
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,480
Wait.

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,640
I'll go with you.

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,280
It happens that I feel like moving.

99
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
You're not writing anymore?

100
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,000
Not writing anymore.

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,520
I'm getting dizzy.

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,440
I'll write it later.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,880
Didn't you say

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
you're not feeling well?

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,480
Why don't you rest at home?

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,640
I'll be back soon.

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,440
Lin Lin, Mom neither wants to supervise you,

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,120
nor do I want to limit

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,760
your freedom.

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Mom just wants your company.

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Have a walk and chat together.

112
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,560
In the future, when you're married,

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
with your wife and kids,

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,640
you won't have time for me anymore.

115
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,480
Right?

116
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Okay, Mom.

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll take a walk with you.

118
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,240
Oh, yeah,

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,480
Lin Lin.

120
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,080
These two days,

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,840
my chest

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,640
feels like there's a rock

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
sitting on it.

124
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,640
It feels tight.

125
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,760
Why don't you stay at home at night?

126
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
In case if something happens,

127
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,360
there's someone with me.

128
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Right?

129
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay, Mom.

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,120
For the next few days,

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,200
I'll come back to keep you company.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,480
My Lin Lin is such a good boy.

133
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
You must have been busy recently.

134
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
Not too bad.

135
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,400
What time is it now?

136
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,360

You have all arrived.

145
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,840
Let me introduce.

146
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,760
These are all

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
the teachers from our high school section.

Call me Old Li.

161
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
I retired last year.

162
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,080
Even so, you were still a director.

Have a seat.

166
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,160
Director Li, please sit here.

167
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,960
Right next to Ms Shen.

168
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,920
Okay, okay.

169
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
Here, here.

170
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,880
Thank you for that then.

171
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,640
Sit.

172
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,040
Hurry. You've waited for long.

173
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Let's raise your glass.

174
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,520
Sure.

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,960
Okay?

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,720
Here.

177
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
Happy birthday to Ms Shen.

178
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,840
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

179
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,360
Thank you. Thank you.

180
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,480
Be happy every day.

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,000
Come.

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
Come. Everyone, let's eat.

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,080
Director Li.

184
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,040
Uhm...Did you attend

185
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,400
the research meeting

186
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
held in the city last year?

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
It's the year before last year.

188
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,640
The autumn of the year before last year.

189
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,560
Yes, yes. The autumn of the year before last year.

190
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,480
No wonder.

191
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,680
When I came in just now,

192
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
I thought you looked familiar.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,640
Really?

194
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
Because I attended it as well.

195
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,200
We didn't greet each other by then.

196
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,240
It just hit me.

197
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,400
Tian,

198
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,320
aren't you

199
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
researching for

200
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,320
a thesis now?

201
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,560
Old Li has worked

202
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,320
at the education bureau

203
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
for a long time.

204
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
Maybe she can help you.

205
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,360
I wouldn't want to trouble.

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,240
What thesis?

207
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,880
Actually, it's nothing.

208
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
I was thinking that

209
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,840
based on the education reformation

210
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,240
and my own work experience

211
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,159
from recent years,

212
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,040
I want to analyze and discuss

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
some new teaching methods.

214
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Ms Tian really is

215
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,800
a model teacher.

216
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
No.

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
At my age,

218
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,320
to take care of teenagers,

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
I'd get outdated

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
if I don't learn.

221
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,920
How about this?

222
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
When I go back,

223
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,400
I'll compile and arrange

224
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,720
all the related references

225
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,760
and pass them to you.

226
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
Maybe it can be of help.

227
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,640
That's great!

228
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,480
Thank you so much, Director Li.

229
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Thank you.

230
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,720
It's okay. No sweat.

231
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,760
That's great.

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Then... Let's raise our glass again.

233
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Sure. It's her birthday.

234
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,080
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

235
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
Thank you.

236
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,080
Here.

237
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Try it.

238
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,480
How is it?

239
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,400
Very bitter.

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
Golden Mandheling.

241
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,480
Right.

242
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Look at how pretty the beans are.

243
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,240
Look at how plump they are. Right?

244
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,680
I haven't seen you

245
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
so happy for a long time.

246
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,040
Really?

247
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,680
Your product

248
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
just went online

249
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
and you already have more than

250
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
10 million registered users.

251
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
Congratulations.

252
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,080
You can finally have

253
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
a good sleep tonight.

254
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,440
Not really.

255
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,800
It's just the power of promotion.

256
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,600
The actual situation,

257
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
whether we can get a firm foothold

258
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,960
is still yet to be sure.

259
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,880
You're worried about Song Lin.

260
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
This person is unpredictable.

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,880
He's hard to read.

262
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm very curious.

263
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,520
You didn't go home

264
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
these few days?

265
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,880
How can your body stand it?

266
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,440
We've already

267
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,560
lost our first strike.

268
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,120
It's the crucial stage now.

269
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
I need to keep a close eye.

270
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,240
There can't be any mistakes.

271
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,040
But you shouldn't

272
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,760
push yourself

273
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,560
too hard either.

274
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
It's okay. I know what I'm doing.

275
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,120
In management science,

276
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,320
the long-term tense emotion

277
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
of a manager

278
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
will affect one's judgement,

279
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,160
then a wrong decision will be made.

280
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,360
If so, the loss will outweigh the gain.

281
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,040
Right.

282
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Let's go. Go out and have a walk with me.

283
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,800
Let's go.

284
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,960
What are we going to do?

285
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,560
What about this?

286
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,200
It's pretty good.

287
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
Wrap this up for me.

288
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,000
Sure.

289
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,520
Thank you.

290
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,320
You bought so much in one shop.

291
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,680
Shopaholic.

292
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm a workaholic. But at the same time,

293
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,880
I'm also a woman, okay?

294
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,360
Actually,

295
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,680
a lot of women,

296
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
regardless of their professions,

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,000
they would share

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
one common trait.

299
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
That is to buy things.

300
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
I didn't like

301
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,440
online shopping.

302
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
I felt that with just a model

303
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,640
and a few photos,

304
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,680
I wouldn't be able to tell

305
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
how it'll look when I put it on

306
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
and how's the texture.

307
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,440
Shopping without the experience

308
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,240
wouldn't bring

309
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
any consumption happiness.

310
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,520
Then, isn't what we're doing now

311
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,080
going completely against

312
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,000
your idea of consumption?

313
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
That's why I wanted you to come out

314
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,440
and shop with me.

315
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Of course, it's not just to

316
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,320
buy clothes with me.

317
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,880
Since the application

318
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,480
that we're making

319
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,760
aims to solve this problem

320
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
and focuses on building the experience,

321
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,760
then how can we actually

322
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,200
increase consumers' satisfaction

323
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
when they shop?

324
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,840
Have you ever thought about this?

325
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,720
I really never thought about this before.

326
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,640
Our company's staff

327
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,920
are all men,

328
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
they're technicians.

329
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,640
No one's

330
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
researching on women's psychology.

331
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,440
Based on what you said,

332
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,960
if we can incorporate this aspect

333
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,600
into the software,

334
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
it'll have a better effect.

335
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
Do you know why Su Yu Shan

336
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,680
was so rushed to release

337
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,520
his application online?

338
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,000
The biggest reason is

339
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,800
to catch us

340
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,640
off guard.

341
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,440
He knows very clearly that

342
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
his project has some

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
technical flaws.

344
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,480
But his marketing strategy

345
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,400
and customers' experience

346
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,960
are his only shortcut to success.

347
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,400
So...

348
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,120
Improve the

349
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,160
user experience

350
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,560
and make it more realistic.

351
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,000
If we can work on these aspects,

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,360
we'll have a better chance of winning.

353
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,760
Right?

354
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,920
You can put it that way.

355
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,760
But Wan Feng

356
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,280
has sufficient financial support.

357
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,320
We need to ensure

358
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
anything going wrong.

359
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,080
Whenever I think about Ms Tian,

360
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
I get headaches.

361
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,360
You'll see.

362
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,160
There will be more battles incoming

363
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
in the future.

364
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,720
You can fight your battles,

365
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,320
just make sure you don't hurt the innocent.

366
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,000
You are my

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,120
strongest support.

368
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,200
If you weren't by my side,

369
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,600
I wouldn't even dare to

370
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
step into the school.

371
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,240
In order to express

372
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,280
my utmost appreciation,

373
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,520
today,

374
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,280
whatever you set your eyes on,

375
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,000
they're all on me.

376
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,680
Then, all those

377
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
problems that

378
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,680
you solved for me before,

379
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,320
should I

380
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
splurge as well?

381
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,280
Yeah.

382
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,840
All on me this time,

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,160
all on you next time. How about that?

384
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,840
We're each other's support.

385
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,000
Why must we splurge?

386
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,520
Can't you give me

387
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,160
a chance to shop

388
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,840
to my heart's content?

389
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,040
I have nothing.

390
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,760
The only thing I have is time. So?

391
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,480
You're such a big spender.

392
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
How can Wu San afford

393
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,520
to sustain you next time?

394
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,080
I don't need him to sustain me.

395
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,240
Here you go.

396
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,360
Thank you. Thank you.

397
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,360
You're welcome.

398
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,360
Shopping?

399
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,600
Go and explain it to her.

400
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,720
So that

401
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,480
there'll be no misunderstanding.

402
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,800
Okay. Sorry.

403
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,000
Zhou Fang.

404
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,160
Zhou Fang. Zhou Fang.

405
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Zhou Fang, don't misunderstand.

406
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Song Lin!

407
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,920
I know there is

408
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,560
nothing between

409
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,440
you and that woman,

410
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,000
but we saw

411
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
you and she were shopping together,

412
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm very unhappy,

413
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,960
I'll have you know.

414
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,680
You'd better explain

415
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,599
this situation.

416
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,040
I will explain.

417
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,560
But

418
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,359
you have to

419
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,200
give me a chance to explain.

420
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,800
Say it.

421
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,560
I... I didn't come out to shop.

422
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,839
I came out to talk about work.

423
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,040
We kept talking about work. Truly.

424
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,720
If you wanted to talk about work,
why were you two

425
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,560
shopping together?

426
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,760
We weren't shopping.

427
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,200
She wanted me to take a look
at physical shops.

428
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
She said there are

429
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,160
some problems with our software.

430
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,920
That shopping at the physical shop

431
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
feels more realistic,

432
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
and provides a better user experience.

433
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
I need to integrate this realism

434
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,960
into the software.

435
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,560
Do you understand?

436
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,240
I work overtime every day.

437
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,280
How would I have time to shop,

438
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,880
right?

439
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you telling the truth?

440
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,360
It's the truth.

441
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,600
I trust you.

442
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,120
But

443
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
when a girl sees

444
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,640
her boyfriend

445
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
shopping alone with

446
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,480
another girl,

447
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,200
do you know how she would feel?

448
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,120
I know. I know.

449
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,680
You know and you still did it?

450
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,120
It's indeed my fault this time.

451
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,240
I didn't pay attention to these.

452
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,720
Next time, I will pay attention to

453
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
these things. I'll never

454
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
make the same mistake again, okay?

455
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,080
I think

456
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,000
his attitude is

457
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,680
pretty sincere.

458
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,040
He shouldn't be lying.

459
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,160
How about

460
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,840
we continue to monitor

461
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
how he behaves after this?

462
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Did you hear me?

463
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,320
Yes, I did. I know.

464
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,200
I'll leave first.

465
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,040
You two talk.

466
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,320
Talk it through.

467
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll go.

468
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't misunderstand.

469
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
You're still angry?

470
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,440
I said it's a misunderstanding.

471
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,360
Let's go. Okay?

472
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Everyone's looking at you.

473
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
Hurry and come with me.

474
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,920
Thank you.

475
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,680
You're welcome.

476
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,720
Look like I didn't buy enough.

477
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Are you okay?

478
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,080
Why?

479
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,120
You think that drinking alcohol in the day

480
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
damages my image?

481
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,560
What happened to you today?

482
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,000
You feel totally different

483
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,200
from your usual self.

484
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
What's my usual self?

485
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,240
Not like this anyway.

486
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,560
I'm usually working.

487
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm a woman too.

488
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,160
I'd want to be lazy.

489
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,720
I'd want someone

490
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,680
to lean on.

491
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,400
But why is it so hard?

492
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,360
This is my first time

493
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,440
seeing you so dispirited.

494
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,400
Hearing what you said,

495
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,240
you have relationship problems?

496
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,800
Tell me.

497
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,560
Who did you fall in love with?

498
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,280
I...

499
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,760
might be in love with Song Lin.

500
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,920
Wait. I remember you

501
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
told me that...

502
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,800
aside from Lin Yun,

503
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,640
you would never be in love

504
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
with another person.

505
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,280
But

506
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,120
Song Lin and Lin Yun are different.

507
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,800
Actually, I'm not so sure about it.

508
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,960
At first, my feelings towards Song Lin

509
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
was pure admiration.

510
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,920
I admired how he treats people
and deals with matters.

511
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
I admired his principles.

512
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,960
Even

513
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,760
the way he protects Zhou Fang.

514
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,520
But you have to know,

515
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
as we got to know each other longer,

516
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
even I'm not sure

517
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,560
whether my admiration towards him

518
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,240
has changed subconsciously

519
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,320
into another type of feelings.

520
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,080
Isn't that funny?

521
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Ling Xi.

522
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,520
Forget about it.

523
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,560
Besides, Song Lin,

524
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
has Zhou Fang.

525
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,520
I know.

526
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,320
Then...

527
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,840
Then aren't you

528
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
just asking for trouble?

529
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,240
The things I admire him the most

530
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,080
are far more than these.

531
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,760
He has never asked Zhou Fang

532
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
to be the woman behind him.

533
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,560
Instead, he gave Zhou Fang space

534
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,720
to do more

535
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,840
things that Zhou Fang likes.

536
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,920
This is what I'm

537
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
envious of Zhou Fang.

538
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
But I also know that

539
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,520
in their

540
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,640
world,

541
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,920
I, Ling Xi,

542
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,880
am just an outsider

543
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,080
and can only be an outsider.

544
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,960
You must be busy recently.

545
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,840
Do you work overtime every day?

546
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,520
Let me tell you,

547
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,240
work is work, being busy is being busy,

548
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,760
but health is the most important.

549
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
I'll pass the same words

550
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
back to you.

551
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,000
Work is important,

552
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,120
but so is your health.

553
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,520
You're already so busy,

554
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,200
don't make time

555
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
to go shopping with other people.

556
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
It's not good for your health.

557
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,120
Okay.

558
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,760
Haven't I made myself clear?

559
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,880
You're still angry?

560
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,080
Drink slowly. No one's fighting with you.

561
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,240
Wipe your mouth.

562
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,960
Who said no one's fighting with me?

563
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,160
Tons of people are fighting.

564
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,480
Who's fighting with you?

565
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
No. Who has the capability

566
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
to fight with you?

567
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,840
Even if she wants to fight, she's not capable.

568
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,400
Right?

569
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,760
Still angry?

570
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,160
Let's have some wine.

571
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,920
What do you think?

572
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Hello, I'll have a bottle of wine.

573
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,680
If you can't drink,

574
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,040
don't drink so much.

575
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,160
Recently,

576
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,840
too many things happened.

577
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,920
Too many things!

578
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,000
Sometimes, I would think

579
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,360
I'm not sure

580
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,960
whether I can bring you happiness.

581
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,880
Do you know what I want?

582
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know what you want.

583
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,960
But I need to know

584
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,720
what I can give you.

585
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,320
Right?

586
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,160
I have meetings with my staff

587
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,200
at the company every day.

588
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,600
I told everyone,

589
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,960
don't be anxious, don't panic.

590
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,800
Everything will be okay.

591
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,920
Everything can be overcome.

592
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,680
We have our advantages.

593
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,200
I've said these words so much

594
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
that I'm numbed.

595
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,160
In the end, even I'm not sure

596
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,000
deep in my heart.

597
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,440
In the hearts of the staff,

598
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,960
I, Song Lin,

599
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,320
am the epitome of tenacity.

600
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,000
No matter what happens,

601
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,120
as long as I'm here,

602
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,920
everything can be overcome.

603
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Why are those old employees

604
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,320
still willing

605
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,120
to work for me?

606
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,160
Why?

607
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
Because they trust me.

608
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,480
Even until now,

609
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,560
they trust me unwaveringly.

610
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,200
But I know myself.

611
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,400
Deep down, I wasn't sure about it.

612
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,880
Then who can I tell these to?

613
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
At least, Ling Xi

614
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,680
is helping you wholeheartedly,

615
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,400
isn't she?

616
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,200
Ling Xi quitted her job.

617
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,840
She invested

618
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,360
all her assets in my project.

619
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm not sure

620
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
where she's coming from,

621
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,840
but now,

622
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,920
I can only move forward.

623
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,640
I can't turn back.

624
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
How can I retreat?

625
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
I can't lose.

626
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,320
If this project fails,

627
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,680
it'll be over for us.

628
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,960
It'll be over for everyone.

629
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll lose everything.

630
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,920
How else can I fulfill

631
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,040
my promise to you?

632
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,800
Then why didn't you

633
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,080
tell me about all these before?

634
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,240
I wanted to tell you.

635
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,080
But I couldn't say it out

636
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,840
before.

637
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
I wanted to ask you

638
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,600
to quit working for Su Yu Shan

639
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,960
and come back to my side.

640
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,560
But how am I supposed to say this out?

641
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,280
The moment I say it out, I would have lost.

642
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,680
Although I can't help you much,

643
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,080
at least I can

644
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,000
stay by your side

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,920
and console you.

646
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
You keep everything to yourself

647
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,960
and suffer on your own.

648
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
Do you know

649
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
how bad I felt?

650
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,160
Don't feel bad.

651
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,480
I wish to see you succeed.

652
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,840
Now, you are

653
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,240
growing every single day.

654
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,680
Right? Seeing you grow,

655
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,360
I feel very happy.

656
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,440
I do feel happy.

657
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,360
So,

658
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,160
you move forward.

659
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,120
You protect your dreams.

660
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,760
I protect you. I told you about that before.

661
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,240
No matter what method I use,

662
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,560
I'll definitely do my best

663
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,760
to catch up to you as much as possible.

664
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,040
When that happens, we can

665
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,760
move forward together.

666
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
With your capabilities,

667
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
this is at most a small trial.

668
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm the one trying

669
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,400
to catch up to you.

670
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,400
Zhou Fang.

671
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,080
Let me tell you.

672
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,480
You stay by my side.

673
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,320
You staying by my side is

674
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,040
helping me

675
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,720
be better day by day.

676
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,200
You know that?

677
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,280
In the end,

678
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,320
it's all because of you.

679
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,840
Did I wake you up?

680
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,920
It's okay.

681
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,320
Do you want to rest a bit longer?

682
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
It's okay. What's the matter?

683
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,240
Based on our current condition,

684
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,600
I've come up with an overall plan.

685
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,400
First, we need to confirm

686
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,640
when to release the application.

687
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,440
Following that is the second round of financing.

688
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,280
Of course,

689
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,920
the reaction after the release

690
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,040
is the key to financing.

691
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,600
Okay. I'll come up with

692
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,120
the proposal first

693
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,920
and then, let you have a look.

694
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,120
Okay. I won't bother you then.

695
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,440
Uhm...

696
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,120
Ling Xi.

697
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,360
I need to tell you something.

698
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
I know what you want

699
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,640
to tell me.

700
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,520
As a bystander,

701
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm very clear

702
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,240
about your relationship with Zhou Fang.

703
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
I don't want to be the destroyer.

704
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,440
So, you can pay all your attention

705
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,560
to the company.

706
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,520
I don't want my relationship and career

707
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,440
to fail.

708
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,400
But just to

709
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,320
put it out there,

710
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,200
if in the future,

711
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,600
Zhou Fang chooses to let go,

712
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,800
please tell me.

713
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,480
I don't want to miss the opportunity.

714
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,920
It won't happen.

715
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,080
I won't give Zhou Fang

716
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,920
a chance to let go.

717
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:18,880
Fine.

718
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,240
I'll leave you to your work then.

719
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,640
You're here.

720
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,880
She didn't find out, right?

721
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,080
Don't worry.

722
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,800
I'm good with

723
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,480
keeping secrets.

724
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,080
Reliable.

725
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,400
Have you clarified

726
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,960
the misunderstanding?

727
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:53,960
Your company

728
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,000
is at the crucial stage now

729
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,160
and you're proposing to her?

730
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,320
What's wrong with

731
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,520
our company's condition?

732
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,880
Even if the research and development
fail in the end,

733
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,120
it won't affect

734
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,480
how I treat her, right?

735
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
That's better.

736
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,080
As Zhou Fang's

737
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,000
best bestie,

738
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,280
I don't wish to see her

739
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,240
being mistreated.

740
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,360
You should understand.

741
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,080
I understand. I understand very much.

742
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,240
You're her best friend.

743
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,120
Have some faith in me,

744
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,640
okay?

745
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,480
I have experience

746
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
of being successful before.

747
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,520
I used to be

748
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,920
a well-known entrepreneur, okay?

749
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,080
As long as you two

750
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,000
love each other,

751
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
those material comforts

752
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
are not important.

753
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
Being happy is important.

754
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
I trust Zhou Fang's taste.

755
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
I trust your taste.

756
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,360
Let me have a look.

757
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,720
Don't disappoint me.

758
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,560
I won't.

759
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Where's my surprise?

760
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,560
Look.

761
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:51,960
What do you think?

762
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,160
Amazing. Let me tell you.

763
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,080
This kind of creativity, this kind of design.

764
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
You're the only one can do it.

765
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
Of course.

766
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,440
Director Li.

767
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,600
Look at you. You took it seriously.

768
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,840
I promised you.

769
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,040
I can't break my promise.

770
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
I sorted these

771
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,400
by myself.

772
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,720
These are resources that can be
accessed externally.

773
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,160
They might be a bit messy.

774
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,480
Have a look and see which parts

775
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,440
are unclear.

776
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,800
We can discuss it.

777
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,160
This is great.

778
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,840
I don't even know

779
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,920
how to thank you.

780
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,760
Don't mention it.

781
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
You could've just called me

782
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,840
and I'd head over to collect it,

783
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,280
instead of you making a trip here.

784
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
I just have too much time.

785
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Since I have too much time anyway,

786
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,120
I take it as exercise.

787
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,680
Thank you so much.

788
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,480
Tian.

789
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,680
Please say.

790
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,440
The two of us are

791
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,400
sisters now, right?

792
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,200
Of course.

793
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,440
Can you not be like this?

794
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,400
You keep calling me...

795
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,400
You keep addressing me as you*.
*(Lit.: Honorific form)

796
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,760
Which year were you born in?

797
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,520
I was born in 1964.

798
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm one year older than you.

799
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,080
How about this? You call me Old Li.

800
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,600
I call you Tian.

801
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,840
I can't possibly...

802
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,840
No, I didn't

803
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,640
mean it that way.

804
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,040
I mean

805
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,520
it's okay for you to call me Tian,

806
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,920
but I...

807
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,320
How about I call you Miss Li?

808
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Or Miss Hui?

809
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,440
No. How about this?

810
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,840
Call me whatever you want,

811
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
but you have to remove the 'you'*.
*(Lit.: Honorific form)

812
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,840
It's tiring to hear it.

813
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,480
You two are chatting.

814
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,240
It's good that Director Li is here.

815
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,400
Two days later,

816
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,320
we are

817
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
going for a trip for two days.

818
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Join us.

819
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,080
That's right, Miss Ru Hui.

820
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,280
Go together with us.

821
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,200
The more, the merrier.

822
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,520
Let's go.

823
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,480
Should I go?

824
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,520
Sure. I'll go.

825
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm a person who

826
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,520
enjoys the merry.

827
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,040
That's great.

828
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
How did you know I'm here?

829
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,560
Your young tailor told me.

830
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,400
He doesn't talk

831
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,160
to people normally.

832
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,280
The ones he talks to

833
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,880
aren't normal.

834
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,280
Show off.

835
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
How's the company now?

836
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,240
Pretty good.

837
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,160
Just continue our run on a different track.

838
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,840
Come here and eat together.

839
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
Let's go eat something else.

840
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,760
I don't want to move. I'm too lazy.

841
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,560
Why are you so lazy?

842
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Why are you so lazy?

843
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,200
What are you doing?

844
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,760
Everyone's looking.

845
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,640
Hurry, put me down.

846
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,440
So what if they look?

847
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,200
My girlfriend is so pretty.

848
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,120
They should be envious.

849
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,900
[Wu San]

850
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,840
Hello?

851
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,080
Sweetheart.

852
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,560
What are you doing?

853
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,840
Are you okay to talk?

854
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Yeah. I'm having my facial mask on.

855
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,760
You're carrying out

856
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,680
the whitening task I assigned to you?

857
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Let me tell you

858
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,200
super good news.

859
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,960
What good news?

860
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,920
My mom's going on a vacation

861
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,800
next week.

862
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,320
You know about it?

863
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,840
I don't know.

864
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
Then why are you so calm?

865
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,480
Your mom hasn't figured it out

866
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,400
and accepted me.

867
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,760
Why should I be excited?

868
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,160
Think about it. We'll have a few days

869
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,000
of free time

870
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
to be together.

871
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,240
I can keep you company more.

872
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,200
Your mom isn't

873
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,480
going at the right time.

874
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,720
What do you mean?

875
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,639
Everything is happening at the same time.

876
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Next week, I need to meet a client.

877
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,280
Such a coincidence.

878
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,960
This client is very important.

879
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
I can't change the date.

880
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Fine.

881
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,800
Don't be sad.

882
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,840
I'll come back as soon as possible.

883
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,400
I'll continue with my work then.

884
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll hang up now.

885
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,199
Lin Lin.

886
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Who are you calling?

887
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm discussing work

888
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,239
with my colleague, Mom.

889
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,600
Hello, President Song.

890
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,320
President Song.

891
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,040
Is there any problem

892
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,800
with this proposal?

893
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,400
No problem.

894
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,040
Xiao Fei and the others will

895
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,000
get it done as soon as possible.

896
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,720
Don't be pressured.

897
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,560
It's okay to be slightly behind schedule.

898
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,120
As long as our program is good,

899
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
the rest wouldn't be a problem.

900
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,600
The main thing that I'm worried about is

901
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,640
the investors

902
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,400
giving you pressure.

903
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Madam Cheng's side

904
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,040
shouldn't be a problem.

905
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,440
But the other investor.

906
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,680
I think they'll continue

907
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,360
to pressure you.

908
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,720
Don't worry.

909
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,960
Uncle, look.

910
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,800
The heart medicine, medicated massage oil,

911
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,760
motion sickness pills, cold medicine.

912
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,720
All these are prepared.

913
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,520
What else are we missing?

914
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,240
Are there ones to help with digestion?

915
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,760
Help with digestion?

916
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
Yes. They're at the bottom.

917
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,840
Okay. When your Auntie is happy,

918
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
she'll have a good appetite,

919
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,880
but her stomach isn't good.

920
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,800
Why are you here?

921
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,880
Auntie.

922
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,440
Look.

923
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,040
The kids are being thoughtful.

924
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,600
They've prepared the essential items

925
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,480
for you.

926
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,560
What's going on?

927
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,680
Where do you two plan to

928
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,640
send me to?

929
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
My mom is not going

930
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,440
to somewhere rural.

931
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,560
She can definitely find medicine.

932
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,360
Exactly.

933
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,520
Look.

934
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
The three of us

935
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,320
are busy with these for you.

936
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,000
Why can't you just accept it?

937
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,920
You don't usually

938
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
put so much effort.

939
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
You got all excited after

940
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,840
hearing that I'm going out, right?

941
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,520
Auntie, don't worry.

942
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Enjoy your trip.

943
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,760
When Zhou Fang and I have time,

944
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,120
we'll come back to keep Uncle company.

945
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,520
When you come back,

946
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,440
I hope I will improve chess playing skills.

947
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,720
The suitcase is so big.

948
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,600
Isn't it a bit inconvenient?

949
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,880
You don't have much stuff anyway.

950
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,720
How about we change

951
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,440
to a small suitcase?

952
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Okay, good idea.

953
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,480
I'll find a small luggage.

954
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Auntie, let me tell you.

955
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,200
It's important to enjoy your trip,

956
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,760
but while enjoying,

957
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
you have to be careful.

958
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,840
When it gets cold at night,
add another layer of clothes.

959
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,360
But don't wear extra on the day,
don't be too warm.

960
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,000
What's going on today?

961
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,160
Why are you two men so naggy?

962
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,920
Song Lin, come and help me.

963
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm coming.

964
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I'll help her out.

965
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,280
Look at Song.

966
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,800
How meticulous.

967
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
It's good to come out for a trip.

968
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,640
How stressful

969
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,000
our work is usually.

970
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,680
Let's relax.

971
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,920
Many teachers

972
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,880
from our school came.

973
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,640
Many?

974
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,320
Really.

975
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
Put the suitcase here. Come.

976
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,640
Yeah... Put the suitcase underneath.

977
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,800
Thank you, Mister.

978
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,520
You're welcome.

979
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
Okay, thank you.

980
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,200
Let's go.

981
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Let's get on the bus.

982
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,440
Ru Hui, let's sit here.

983
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,000
Okay.

984
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,920
Hello, everyone.

985
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,520
I'm the temporary tour guide

986
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,000
for this trip. I'm Qin Qing.

987
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,200
It's my pleasure to travel

988
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,160
with you all.

989
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,840
I'd like to remind everyone,

990
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,200
during the trip,

991
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,040
please do not act alone.

992
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,800
Everyone must follow the group.

993
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If there's any problem,

994
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
please tell me immediately.

995
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,400
I will do my best to

996
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
solve it together with everyone.

997
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,520
Okay. Fasten your seat belt.

998
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,680
Let's get ready to depart.

999
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
Ms Tian,

1000
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
isn't this your student?

1001
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,000
Look. She even came to school to visit you

1002
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,800
last week.

1003
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,360
What a coincidence?

1004
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,920
Hello, everyone.

1005
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Hello, Ms Tian.

1006
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,200
Uhm...

1007
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
If you can meet your student

1008
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,200
when you're on a trip,

1009
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,920
it means that you two

1010
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
are fated.

1011
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,600
Have everyone fasten your seat belts?

1012
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

1013
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,400
Mister, we can depart now.

1014
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,800
I saw this kind of stitches

1015
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,200
in our TKY's Scarlet Summer Night

1016
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Ready-to-wear Series.

1017
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,400
My teacher is good at

1018
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,160
this kind of stitches too.

1019
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,400
He taught me this for a while.

1020
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,080
That's good.

1021
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,200
When you have time,

1022
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,440
bring me to your hometown to meet

1023
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,120
your teacher then.

1024
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,200
He might not have time

1025
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,640
to teach you.

1026
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
You surely know how to talk.

1027
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,480
You finished this so fast.

1028
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,240
Please check whether everything's okay.

1029
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,760
If there's a problem,

1030
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,600
I'll look for you later.

1031
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,400
What's up?

1032
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,240
Miss Fang, big trouble.

1033
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,960
Qin Qing went and look for my mom

1034
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,200
and she's not answering my calls.

1035
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,600
What should I do?

1036
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,920
Ms Tian called you?

1037
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,480
You know about this?

1038
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,160
Why didn't

1039
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,960
you tell me?

1040
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,920
How can I tell you about this?

1041
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,640
You always say everything out.

1042
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,400
If Ms Tian knows about this,

1043
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
if she finds out, it won't work.

1044
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,880
Still, you both shouldn't act hastily.

1045
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
I think this is

1046
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,720
a good opportunity.

1047
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,520
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

1048
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,960
Just wait for the good news.

1049
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,960
Miss Fang.

1050
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,120
Why are you so confident?

1051
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,960
My mom is very hard to handle.

1052
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,280
Maybe you think that Qin Qing

1053
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,360
is just a young grasshopper,

1054
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,480
but now, there's a master

1055
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,160
guiding her.

1056
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,880
Master?

1057
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,440
Who is it?

1058
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,280
My mom.

1059
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,560
Ms Tian, it'll be a long ride.

1060
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,320
You'll feel more comfortable
if you put this on.

1061
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,640
It's okay. It's okay.

1062
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,240
Come. Put it on. Come.

1063
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,800
It's okay.

1064
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,680
You put it on. You put it on.

1065
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,360
I have another one.

1066
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,720
Auntie can use this one.

1067
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,840
Okay. I... I'll use this one.

1068
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,560
You put this on.

1069
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,280
Come. Put it on.

1070
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,200
I'll put this one on.

1071
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,520
So comfortable.

1072
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,320
So comfortable.

1073
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,880
This kid is so thoughtful.
