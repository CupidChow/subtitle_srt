You lost,

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,520

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,960
What's up?

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,880
Your brother is quite tired these days,

178
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,880
so do behave yourself.

179
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
Tell me if something comes up.

180
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,960
Don't worry.

181
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800
Go in. It's too cold.

182
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,480
Okay.

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,520
You go home early too.

184
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,480
Bye.

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,080
President Song.

186
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,400
You two are here for?

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,160
Have a seat.

188
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,560
Alright.

189
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,360
What's the matter?

190
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
President Sun and I are here

191
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,400
to express our determination

192
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,080
on behalf of

193
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,960
the senior management of our group.

194
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes.

195
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
All of us, have made up our mind.

196
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,840
We are all following you,

197
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,920
and waiting for you to rise again.

198
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,560
So for the time being,

199
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
you can stop worrying

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,040
about Wan Feng.

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,640
I have seen it all

202
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,640
over the years.

203
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Until today,

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,920
still being able to hear

205
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,000
you saying this to me,

206
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,280
I am really grateful.

207
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,000
But now it is still not the time.

208
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,280
No, President Song...

209
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
What are your concerns?

210
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,880
We were all

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,280
made possible by you.

212
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
Everyone is willing

213
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,200
to follow you,

214
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
thinking about

215
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,440
how to put on

216
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
a sharp come-back.

217
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,680
Come-back.

218
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,400
Is it really that easy?

219
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,840
I don't even know what to do.

220
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,560
All these years,
working for the group every day,

221
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
I didn't have much energy
to think about anything else.

222
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,080
This is also an opportunity

223
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,080
for me to relax,

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,080
and to

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
think about how to plan

226
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,560
the future seriously.

227
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,120
It's okay. When I'm really

228
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
done thinking,

229
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,240
you will be busy.

230
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,720
I'll definitely bring all of you back.

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,960
Sure.

232
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
We'll wait for the call

233
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
of President Song at any time.

234
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,520
Wait for me.

235
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,840
Alright.

236
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,960
Then we will be going now.

237
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,920
We're leaving.

238
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,680
Goodbye, President Song.

239
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,760
Such loyalty.

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,360
Song Ling.

241
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,360
Waiting for me?

242
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
How are you doing?

243
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,800
Are you listening?

244
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,840
I'll tell you if there's anything,

245
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
I won't be a stranger
and I won't push myself.

246
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,960
Tell you something.

247
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,920
Su Yu Shan,

248
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,960
is now Wan Feng's

249
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
largest shareholder,

250
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,000
and I will sell off

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
all the shares of Wan Feng I have

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,160
as quickly as possible,

253
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,720
then leave Wan Feng.

254
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
Tomorrow will be

255
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,640
my last day at work.

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,920
After that,

257
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,880
Su Yu Shan will be

258
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Wan Feng's chairman.

259
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,160
Then help me terminate my contract.

260
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,640
Why?

261
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,280
I'm the designer that you signed,

262
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
and your girlfriend.

263
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,480
You won't mind

264
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,160
if I'm working for someone else?

265
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,720
That's not necessary.

266
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,000
That is work.

267
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,720
It's okay. I have thought of it too,

268
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,560
several major shopping sites are now

269
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,120
under Su Yu Shan.

270
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,960
If you don't work with him,

271
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,760
who will you be working with?

272
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,000
I will work with

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,920
other smaller sites.

274
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,240
What's that for?

275
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,640
It's alright.

276
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,440
You being together with me,

277
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,440
all I want is for you to do good.

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
I hope I can take care of you

279
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
and help you

280
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,800
instead of holding you back.

281
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,920
right?

282
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
You are the one who's in trouble,

283
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,320
yet you still worried about me.

284
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,040
You matter the most,

285
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,280
you know?

286
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,680
Now let's go home, it's freezing.

287
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,520
Let's go,

288
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
You go first.

289
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,840
You go first.

290
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Come on, come on, come on!

291
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,920
Watching you go home

292
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,520
put my mind at ease.

293
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,360
Now go.

294
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,120
About my resignation,

295
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
no one has to know.

296
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,600
As I always do when I get off work,

297
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,760
I will just leave in silence.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,320
let's go.

299
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,280
President Song,

300
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,400
once you leave today,

301
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I will resign tomorrow.

302
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720

President Song,

338
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,040
even if one day,

339
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,200
you really have nothing left

340
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,320
and become penniless,

341
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,840
you'll still have me.

342
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,520
I will always be there for you.

343
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,600
When it's time to let go,

344
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
you have to let go.

345
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,880
Only the end

346
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,000
will bring a new beginning.

347
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,480
Come on,

348
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,200
let's go home.

349
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,320
At worst, I will feed you.

350
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,320
Let's go.

351
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,400
How come you know I'm hungry?

352
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
Because I know you're tired.

353
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,760
What flavor of noodles do you want?

354
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
Is the water too much?

355
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,480
No, it's just right.

356
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,640
Why don't we put some

357
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,480
hotpot seasoning?

358
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,760
Can you cook noodles in hot pot seasoning?

359
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,280
You can.

360
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,680
You can?

361
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,560
You can.

362
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,280
Alright.

363
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,320
Where is it?

364
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,680
Why are you so happy?

365
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,360
I don't know why

366
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm so happy.

367
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,720
So worthlessly happy.

368
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,240
I was worthy of something,

369
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
but after meeting you,

370
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,520
I become more and more worthless.

371
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,240
And I was so busy working,

372
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,640
and I have no time
to spend with you every day.

373
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,840
Well now,

374
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
I have so much time to spend with you.

375
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,600
Go get the hot pot seasoning.

376
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,240
Okay.

377
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,920
I remember it's here.

378
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,720
Welcome to CRD.

379
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,760
Alright.

380
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,440
Lawyer Shen.

381
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Where's Qin Qing?

382
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,520
Miss Qing is inside.

383
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,320
Alright, thank you.

384
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,040
Being busy?

385
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
Why are you here?

386
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
Why? I'm not welcome?

387
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,760
Not at all.

388
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,200
I just happened to pass by,

389
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,880
for something.

390
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,120
I wonder if you have time

391
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,080
to eat with me?

392
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,680
Why?

393
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,960
Not available?

394
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
You're already here,

395
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,000
how can I say no?

396
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,000
Let's go.

397
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,880
Alright.

398
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,120
Let's go and get some food.

399
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,240
Sure.

400
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:06,880
Go. Time to eat.

401
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,520
-Let's go.
-Go.

402
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,040
Let's go. Lin, let's eat.

403
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm not going, enjoy yourselves.

404
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm telling you,

405
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,080
you just broke up,

406
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,040
you need to get out more.

407
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,800
I'm not going,

408
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,960
you go ahead.

409
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,200
Remember to have a meal.

410
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,700
[Qin Qing]

411
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,100
[Qin Qing]

412
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,800
Give me one of this.

413
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,440
Okay.

414
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,400
And vegetable.

415
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,080
Alright.

416
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,640
Let me repeat your order.

417
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,400
One sea bass, Australian Wagyu Beef,

418
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
Seafood Supreme Beef Pizza,

419
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
German Pork Ribs,

420
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
Mussels Cooked in White Wine,

421
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Low Temperature Slow Roast Beef Ribs,

422
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,560
Roasted Razor Clams with Black Truffle.

423
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,320
How is it?

424
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,200
Want to get anything else?

425
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,600
That's enough.

426
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,600
It's so much we can't even

427
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,120
finish all of it.

428
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,120
That's all, thank you.

429
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,760
Alright.

430
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,280
Thank you.

431
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,280
My parents and I

432
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,000
went to visit your father.

433
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,320
My dad said

434
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,840
he prepared a few bottles of wine.

435
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,120
And when uncle is discharged,

436
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,640
he will celebrate it for him.

437
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,640
These two men.

438
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,560
At their age,

439
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,360
they have just that hobby.

440
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
As long as they're happy,

441
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,680
it's okay to drink a little.

442
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,880
These two days, I've been thinking,

443
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,680
when uncle is out of hospital,

444
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,280
our families should go out

445
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,720
while the weather is good.

446
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,400
Or maybe find a winery

447
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
and we'll stay for a few days.

448
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
You can relax.

449
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,200
We'll see by then.

450
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,040
Sure.

451
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,520
I'll arrange it then.

452
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,400
This way.

453
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,320
I'm really sorry

454
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,240
for the trouble.

455
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,080
You'll get our payment recently.

456
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,160
Let's stay in touch.

457
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
Okay, do it fast.

458
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,880
Alright, I'm really sorry.

459
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,320
Adjust it

460
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,240
within a limited time.

461
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,000
Sure.

462
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm really sorry

463
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,720
for troubling you.

464
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,400
Miss Fang, they are

465
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,320
the last batch, right?

466
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,720
Probably.

467
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,000
We're not

468
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,440
going bankrupt this time, are we?

469
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,960
It's not that serious,

470
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,960
but our loss is not small.

471
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
I think

472
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,160
this as paying

473
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
for a lesson.

474
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,280
We are paying

475
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,200
quite a lot of money on it.

476
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,440
As long as

477
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,520
it's making a better version of myself

478
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
and also leading the company

479
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,000
to a better direction,

480
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,840
I think the money is well spent.

481
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,280
Miss Fang,

482
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,000
so what do you plan to do after this?

483
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,680
Actually, I've learnt that

484
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,080
things like industrial dyes

485
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,360
are prone to problems.

486
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,640
So I think we should

487
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,400
consider

488
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,480
how we could

489
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
make our clothing safer,

490
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,920
make the fabric

491
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,640
that always contacts

492
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,360
with our body

493
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
more comfortable and healthy.

494
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,720
Problems like this

495
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,520
should never

496
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,160
happen again.

497
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,080
So you want to use

498
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,400
a more natural way to dye?

499
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,520
Actually, I have been

500
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,960
introduced to plant dyeing before,

501
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,960
and I think this technique

502
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
can be picked up again.

503
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,800
Plant dyeing?

504
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,600
Plant dyeing is a

505
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,920
very ancient technique.

506
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,840
It's very natural and healthy.

507
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,400
And I think

508
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,000
we can take this opportunity

509
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,040
to reposition

510
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,920
our company

511
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,000
more precisely.

512
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,600
In the past,

513
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,000
our brand's framework, structure,

514
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and concept,

515
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,320
are still a bit vague,

516
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,800
we did whatever we can think of,

517
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,200
And there wasn't much of

518
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,920
a purposeful plan

519
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,320
for the future of our company.

520
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
It's so great.

521
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
It seems like our Miss Fang

522
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,080
has made a qualitative leap this time.

523
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,960
Of course!

524
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,720
Miss Fang,

525
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,760
so for the clothing line
and the haute couture line

526
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
that we have right now,

527
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,560
what is your plan?

528
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
For the clothing line,

529
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,240
we will use the plant dyeing method,

530
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
and we will use Morandi color palette.

531
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,640
that highlights

532
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,520
more on grey,

533
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,000
to maintain a style of being candid

534
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,280
and true to oneself.

535
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,800
because I believe

536
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,920
everyone

537
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,720
is simple at heart.

538
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,320
It's still the same as before,

539
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,800
keeping the clothing line true to self

540
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,560
and focusing on simplicity.

541
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,920
As for

542
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,600
the haute couture line?

543
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,400
I think,

544
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
other than the clients'

545
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,240
personalization needs,

546
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,400
we need to strengthen

547
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,800
our craftsmanship.

548
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,080
As our haute couture line

549
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,440
is still made by hand,

550
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,600
so like a few big orders

551
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,280
introduced

552
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,120
by Miss Izumino,

553
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,920
it's obvious that
we are short of manpower.

554
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,360
so in the future,

555
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,120
if anyone knows

556
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,800
any good tailors,

557
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,640
you can recommend them to me.

558
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
Sure, no problem.

559
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,800
So let us

560
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,120
start our new journey.

561
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,280
That's for sure!

562
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,760
Miss Fang is already working so hard,

563
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,560
God surely

564
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,440
won't let you down.

565
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,880
Let's work hard!

566
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,120
Keep it up!

567
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,280
Keep it up!

568
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,920
Time for overtime.

569
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,880
Let's do this!

570
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,600
I'm leaving now.

571
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,400
Thanks for your hard work.

572
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,240
you're home.

573
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,840
Making this your home?

574
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,720
Are you planning to move in?

575
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,600
I've already told you that.

576
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,480
Be prepared.

577
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,040
Watch a movie with me.

578
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,520
What movie?

579
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,680
Your choice.

580
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,600
Sit closer.

581
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,280
Closer.

582
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,600
It's more comfortable this way.

583
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,440
What do you think I am?

584
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,400
Resting on me as you like.

585
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,440
What do you want to be?

586
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,160
You want to charge me?

587
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
Then pay up.

588
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,840
Sure,

589
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,680
I can only give fifty cents,

590
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,520
not a cent more.

591
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Then move.

592
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,280
I'm paying right now,

593
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,760
here.

594
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,280
So tacky.

595
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,400
Wang He.

596
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,520
cleaning my car to earn money again?

597
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,200
Sister-in-law,

598
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,800
what are you doing here?

599
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,640
Director Wang.

600
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,760
Looks like you two

601
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
are quite close.

602
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,680
Let me tell you,

603
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,080
this is the first time

604
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,800
he has brought a girl here.

605
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,080
For real?

606
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,040
For real.

607
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,960
Director Wang,

608
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,240
this is his first time

609
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,760
bring a girl here?

610
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,800
President Song,

611
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
those new Harleys are quite nice.

612
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,920
Which one

613
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,520
could you give it to me?

614
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,920
Just take whichever you like.

615
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,440
With your words,

616
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,760
it helps a lot, I'm leaving now.

617
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,920
It's really the first time.

618
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,800
It's really the first time?

619
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,840
It's really the first time.

620
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
Fine, I believe you.

621
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,360
Come here.

622
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,240
What?

623
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,360
Look closely.

624
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,400
How is it?

625
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,440
Looks good?

626
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,440
Great.

627
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,400
Do you like it?

628
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,360
Yes.

629
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,040
It's a gift for you.

630
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,560
I don't know how to ride.

631
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,320
Know how to ride a bike?

632
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,880
Yes.

633
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,360
It's almost the same. Come on, let me show you.

634
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,480
Step on here?

635
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,160
Put your hands at the front.

636
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,840
This is the throttle, the brake,

637
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,400
and this is the switch.

638
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,440
You can ride it after you switch it on.

639
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,480
Why kissed me?

640
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,239
I can't help it.

641
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
I'll pick you up after work.

642
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,480
Okay.

643
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,600
Give it to me, I want to bring it in.

644
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
What a coincidence.

645
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,440
President Song, Miss Fang.

646
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,640
Old Shen.

647
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,520
On a date?

648
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,320
That's right.

649
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,360
What about you?

650
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,160
Why do you come together?

651
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,760
He said he wanted to talk to you

652
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,640
about the aftermath of the reparation,

653
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,640
so I followed along.

654
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,320
Song Lin, thanks for

655
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,360
the supplement you gave to my dad.

656
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
We're a family, it doesn't matter.

657
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,520
We will be going in now.

658
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,280
We'll wait for you.

659
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay.

660
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Tell me,

661
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,400
what's going on with Lawyer Shen?

662
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,240
I don't understand.

663
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:07,960
I don't know.

664
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,480
He has been a little aggressive lately.

665
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,440
It's quite scary.

666
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,920
Go on.

667
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,200
Put it down.

668
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,520
-Bye.
-Bye.

669
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,600
Bye.

670
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,480
I think the color scheme

671
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,320
-could be tweaked a bit.
-President Song.

672
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,800
Hi.

673
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,520
Alright.

674
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,640
We can make it

675
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,760
a bit more fitting

676
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,200
from its cutting.

677
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,640
Right.

678
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,800
We also need to consider clients' needs,

679
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,120
including the color.

680
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,480
Zuo.

681
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,920
Lin, what brings you here?

682
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,640
President Song.

683
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,360
Just looking around.

684
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,640
Let's talk for a minute.

685
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,520
Sure.

686
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, you carry on.

687
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,800
Alright.

688
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,760
To the office.

689
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,080
Let's go.

690
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,320
This way.

691
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Lin, have some water.

692
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,560
Lately,

693
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,600
you're not doing well.

694
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I'm not feeling well.

695
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,680
Still being sad about

696
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,760
the break-up?

697
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,760
I saw Qin Qing today.

698
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,920
Qin Qing?

699
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
How is she? Is she doing well?

700
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,360
Quite good.

701
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
Better than you.

702
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,760
As long as she's fine.

703
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,280
I hope that she can be happy.

704
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,320
What's up, buddy?

705
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,880
Are you

706
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
really ready to give up?

707
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,840
What can I do?

708
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Now the business

709
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,320
is just getting started.

710
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,000
She thinks that

711
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm not mature enough.

712
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,560
I can't reach

713
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,680
her expectation for her other half

714
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,760
within a short period.

715
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,720
The only thing I can do now

716
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,040
is not to disturb her.

717
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,200
By the way, Lin,

718
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,760
what about you?

719
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,440
Have you found the buyers

720
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
for Wan Feng's shares?

721
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,880
Almost there.

722
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,040
Good to hear that.

723
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,800
Dividend for the investment

724
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,640
has come in,

725
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
but I haven't spent a cent.

726
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,360
What are you keeping it for?

727
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,120
I know the money

728
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,400
came from

729
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,280
your personal account.

730
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,280
You're now in a special situation.

731
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,600
I was planning to save it for you.

732
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,840
I don't need this money.

733
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,120
Use it.

734
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,080
Zuo,

735
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,400
these days,

736
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,680
prepare a business plan.

737
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,520
Is it about financing?

738
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
Now,

739
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,200
our resources are not good,

740
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,160
pulling in some capital

741
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,880
will make things easier.

742
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,640
Don't worry,

743
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,480
I will

744
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,160
cooperate with you fully.

745
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,080
Take a look.

746
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,800
You are considering it, right?

747
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,480
The domestic market,

748
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,920
I don't have to say much about it.

749
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,600
These two years, I've been doing

750
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,480
the overseas markets.

751
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,400
Now the overseas warehouse

752
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
has been built,

753
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,720
it will be put into use soon.

754
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
Once the overseas warehouse is in operation,

755
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
the overseas earnings

756
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
are particularly promising.

757
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,160
I invested in

758
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,880
a new project,

759
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,120
and I want to do it myself.

760
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,720
So, I'm selling some shares.

761
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,840
President Song,

762
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,080
we really want to

763
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,080
take in your shares.

764
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,760
But as you know,

765
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,200
Bai Sai

766
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,240
kept on

767
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,960
pressuring us.

768
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,080
I understand, I do.

769
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,760
Pressuring you is one thing,

770
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
but this is for sure

771
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,120
a money-making project.

772
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,360
Let me tell you the truth.

773
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,400
President Su,

774
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,280
he has a

775
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,400
long-term collaboration with us.

776
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,760
I wouldn't want to offend him,

777
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
and we can't afford to offend him.

778
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,240
We're really sorry.

779
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,800
What a coincidence.

780
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,400
Yes, such a coincidence.

781
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,400
You are here?

782
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,040
I'm here to talk about work.

783
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,040
And you?

784
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,440
I work here.

785
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,200
You work here?

786
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,560
Alright, then, see you.

787
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,480
See you.

788
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,280
Song Lin,

789
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,240
I've heard something

790
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,080
about your company's shares.

791
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,440
Well? Do you have a minute?

792
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,960
Let's have a drink and talk about it.

793
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,440
Sure.

794
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,040
I don't have anything on anyway.

795
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,680
Let's go.

796
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,440
Actually, I heard about you

797
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,120
from Zhou Fang,

798
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,080
saying that you two
have been friends for many years.

799
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,680
classmates from college, right?

800
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,000
From college until now,

801
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,720
it's almost been a decade.

802
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,160
After so many years,

803
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,640
you should have known her quite well.

804
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,240
Kind of.

805
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,560
But in all these years,

806
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,840
to be honest,

807
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,360
I have never seen Zhou Fang

808
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,280
look at someone

809
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,840
