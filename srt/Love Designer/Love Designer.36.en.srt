00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,960
How's she doing in the USA?

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,200
She's doing well.

179
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
Grandma? Is she healthy?

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm going to

181
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,520
to visit her.

182
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,560
Why don't you

183
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
ask her to stay with you?

184
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,200
She's old.

185
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
She not used to living in the city.

186
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
She wants to stay in town.

187
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I couldn't force her.

188
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
Just go without worries.

189
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll handle

190
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,160
the new office.

191
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,640
Count on you. That's great.

192
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,320
Grandma.

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,560
Aunt Zhao.

194
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,440
Hurry up. Pass it to me.

195
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,960
Okay.

196
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
-Grandma Song.
-Where's my grandma?

197
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,200
Guess who's here?

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
Little kid is back.

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,120
Yes, I'm back.

200
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,400
Let's hug.

201
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,800
How are you?

202
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
Enjoy your time.

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm going to cook now.

204
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

205
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,280
How are you?

206
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm doing well.

207
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm fine.

208
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm healthy.

209
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
You're quite fit.

210
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,160
Right?

211
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm glad to see that.

212
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,120
That's great.

213
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,960
It's been a while.

214
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,560
Do you miss me?

215
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Of course.

216
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,880
But,

217
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,640
you all busy working.

218
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,280
Don't think about me too much.

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,040
Alright.

220
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm fine here.

221
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
Look at the

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,200
big house you built for me.

223
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm satisfied with it.

224
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,280
Glad to hear that.

225
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
I'll be happy if you're happy.

226
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,080
Oh, yes.

227
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,880
I've sent Luo Luo overseas.

228
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,800
Did she call you?

229
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,040
Luo Luo

230
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
calls me often.

231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,320
She told me that

232
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
she was doing well there.

233
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
She also told me that

234
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
a kid called Di

235
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,560
took care of her a lot.

236
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,800
She told you everything.

237
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,040
Grandma. If you're free,

238
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
let's go to the United States.

239
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Let's go on a trip.

240
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,920
It's okay. It's too far.

241
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,840
To me, Shanghai is far,

242
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,480
let alone the United States.

243
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm old.

244
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,400
I just want to enjoy silence.

245
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm fine here.

246
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,679
Okay, as long as you're happy.

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
Later,

248
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,679
let me make some dishes for you?

249
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,720
Your girlfriend taught you that?

250
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Of course.

251
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
Bring her home if you're free.

252
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,520
I want to meet her.

253
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Wait for her...

254
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,080
I'll bring her home when she has time.

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,640
Okay.

256
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,760
How many days are you going to stay here?

257
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
I'll leave when you're happy to let me go.

258
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,080
Okay.

259
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Since you're back,

260
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
go out

261
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,720
more often.

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,360
The air here

263
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,280
is fresher than that of Shanghai.

264
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,880
Okay.

265
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,360
There are not many cars

266
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
and skyscrapers.

267
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Sure. Sure.

268
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,160
You

269
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,920
should relax.

270
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,720
Go in first.

271
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Okay.

272
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
I'll cook delicious foods for you.

273
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,400
We're

274
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,360
so happy today.

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,520
We visited a few shows.

276
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
We're going to

277
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
attend an after-party later.

278
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
Do you know Su Yu Shan?

279
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
He's really cool.

280
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,680
He knows many people.

281
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
[Wu Shan]
He gave us

282
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,800
the entry tickets of the shows today.

283
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,200
He's being so good to you all.

284
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,880
Isn't it suspicious?

285
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
I've asked Zhou Fang.

286
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,000
She said no.

287
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,400
Then it should be no.

288
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Are you going

289
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,920
to drink tonight?

290
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Being outside now,

291
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,920
I dare not to drink too much.

292
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
But I might drink a little.

293
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,840
Or else, you'd be worried.

294
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,360
Right?

295
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
So good now.

296
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
Do you love me more?

297
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Love you very much.

298
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,920
Sweetheart,

299
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm going out later.

300
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,240
Help me pick

301
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
a nice dress.

302
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Wait. My mum's coming.

303
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm going to hang up.

304
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,680
Okay, sure.

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
What did you bring?

306
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,600
This...

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,360
Do you wear it

308
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,200
when going to the market?

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,360
How about wearing mine?

310
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm here to learn,

311
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,120
not for a catwalk.

312
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
Why should I wear so nicely?

313
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,960
It's the Milan Fashion Week,

314
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,440
okay?

315
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,440
Please be overdressed, okay?

316
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
Sisters.

317
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,720
How does

318
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,520
my dress look like?

319
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,520
Not bad.

320
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,440
The dress shows off your waist.

321
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
I think your make-up

322
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
can be heavier.

323
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
Add eyeliner.

324
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,240
This part? Heavier?

325
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,880
Okay, I'll make it now.

326
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,760
Look at Shen Pei Pei.

327
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
Then, you look at yourself.

328
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,560
What dress

329
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,960
is that?

330
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,160
Ugly.

331
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,480
Can't you wear

332
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,160
something

333
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
more colourful?

334
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,880
You claim yourself as a fashion designer.

335
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,880
A 10-hour

336
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,600
flight.

337
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
Aren't you tired?

338
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm lazy to get changed.

339
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
So lazy.

340
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,640
Did you

341
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
report to

342
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,520
Song Lin this time?

343
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,960
No.

344
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,000
He doesn't care about me either.

345
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,080
Both of you really...

346
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,600
It's just a small matter.

347
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
Just be tolerant, and it will be solved.

348
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,040
Sometimes,

349
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,160
a problem can't be solved easily

350
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,640
by being tolerant.

351
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
The problem will get worse.

352
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,280
You really turn me off.

353
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Let's get changed

354
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,400
and eat.

355
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm hungry.

356
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,600
Eat again?

357
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,640
You've just eaten, right?

358
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm hungry.

359
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Grandma.

360
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
It's getting cold.

361
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
Be careful not to get cold.

362
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,640
Ya Ya.

363
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You've worked so hard these years.

364
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm old.

365
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,640
I couldn't help you much.

366
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,280
You just need to take care of your health

367
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,880
and stay happy.

368
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,960
That's the biggest help ever,

369
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,560
grandma.

370
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,280
You are always alone.

371
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,520
Little kid.

372
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,880
You should have your own family.

373
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,360
No hurry.

374
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
Now,

375
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
it's more important to handle my business

376
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
and take care of you all.

377
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,920
I have to take care of Luo Luo as well.

378
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,360
Family

379
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,040
will be formed

380
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,880
at the right time.

381
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,920
No worry.

382
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,960
That's right.

383
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,440
I remember that your grandpa

384
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,960
told me that

385
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
he must

386
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
passed away after me.

387
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Who would have known that

388
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
he had been dead for ten years?

389
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
After that,

390
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,680
I realized that

391
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
we must not be afraid of losing it,

392
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,000
when we own something.

393
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,160
Or else,

394
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,480
we'll regret when it's gone.

395
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
I remember

396
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,040
a quote from a book.

397
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,280
It said that a family means that

398
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,280
a family member is sent

399
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
from the earth

400
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,200
to Heaven one by one.

401
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,520
At last,

402
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,080
all the family members will have a reunion.

403
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,640
Don't think about it, Grandma.

404
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,440
I'm here to visit you.

405
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,000
Be happy.

406
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,880
Since you're back,

407
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,600
don't forget to

408
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
visit your grandpa's graveyard

409
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,600
and give flowers

410
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
to your parents.

411
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,120
For sure.

412
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Give flowers.

413
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,960
Let's drink tea.

414
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,600
Okay.

415
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,320
Come.

416
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,960
Let me try the tea you make.

417
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,720
What tea is this?

418
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,920
Come.

419
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,440
Sit down and drink.

420
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,240
My feet are painful.

421
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,280
After-party

422
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,600
is more exhausting than shows.

423
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Including the girl group

424
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,160
before the party started,

425
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,080
I've made

426
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,560
13 interviews.

427
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,080
Don't forget to

428
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,680
send me the show photos.

429
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
Sure.

430
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
I'll send them to you later.

431
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,240
I'm so tired from

432
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,040
visiting the jewelry exhibition.

433
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,640
Who did suggest

434
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,600
to wear high heels?

435
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,480
Who?

436
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,960
You, right?

437
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,400
You asked us to wear as well.

438
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,960
Was I the one?

439
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,920
Why am I

440
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,960
so stupid?

441
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,960
How good

442
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,640
if Wu San was here now.

443
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
He'd massage me.

444
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,880
Come. Give me a massage.

445
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Miss Qing.

446
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,760
You're good

447
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,480
at showing affections to the singles.

448
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
So, you have to work harder.

449
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,240
How are you

450
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,000
and you man?

451
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,120
Have you contacted him?

452
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,840
No.

453
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,480
What's wrong with you both?

454
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,400
I tell you.

455
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,640
It'll become a norm

456
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
if the cold war between two people continues.

457
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,040
Be tolerant

458
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
if you love him.

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,360
If I were you,

460
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,880
I wouldn't care to apologize first

461
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
and to be embarrassed.

462
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,960
If you love him,

463
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,200
being together

464
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
is the most important thing.

465
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
You're quite smart in love.

466
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,160
The fifth day in Milan,

467
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
I miss Wu San.

468
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,760
I want to return.

469
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,040
Don't joke.

470
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't you want to visit

471
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,800
the filming location of

472
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,560
Game of Thrones in Ireland?

473
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,880
I don't want to.

474
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I want to return.

475
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,880
But we've bought

476
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,360
the flight tickets to Ireland, right?

477
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
We can just return the tickets.

478
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,640
Let's go back.

479
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,440
Miss Qing, I think

480
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
your brain is full of love.

481
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
Return the ticket for me.

482
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,320
Let's go back together.

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,640
Let me see.

484
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,040
Sweetheart,

485
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
Why did you come back suddenly?

486
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I miss you.

487
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,480
What's this?

488
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,880
It's yours.

489
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,319
What a luxurious watch.

490
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
You've given everything

491
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,560
to me.

492
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,040
Can't I buy you a watch?

493
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
How's it? Do you like it?

494
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,040
Yes.

495
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,560
I've liked this watch

496
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,480
for a long time.

497
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,599
But I don't afford to buy it.

498
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,000
I knew that you like it.

499
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,440
So, in future,

500
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,640
you'll think about me

501
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,760
when looking at it.

502
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,640
Hungry, right? Let's eat.

503
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,040
Come.

504
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,080
So cute.

505
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,080
Just now, I asked Xiao Fei

506
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,960
if you had eaten.

507
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
He told me that you hadn't.

508
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,960
So I've cooked something for you.

509
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,960
No wonder he

510
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,080
didn't allow me to order takeouts.

511
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,440
What are you looking at?

512
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,160
Why don't you eat?

513
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
It looks too good to eat.

514
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,560
So childish.

515
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,520
If you want to eat,

516
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,800
I can make it for you at any time.

517
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,480
It's a heart-shaped egg.

518
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,680
I learned it online.

519
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,960
Lin! Lin!

520
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,200
Your mum's here!

521
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,080
Mum.

522
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,560
Why are you here?

523
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,400
I've cooked something for you.

524
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,040
I'm afraid that you can't eat well.

525
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I almost finish my work.

526
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,360
Aren't you tired from coming here?

527
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm fine.

528
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
What are you doing, Mum?

529
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,640
I'm visiting

530
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,600
your company.

531
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,400
Mum.

532
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,760
Didn't you...

533
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,480
Didn't you visit it before?

534
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,600
Can't I visit it again?

535
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,400
Hello.

536
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
Hello, Aunt.

537
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,920
Your meeting room

538
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
looks good.

539
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,240
It's light and spacious.

540
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,560
Not bad.

541
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,640
The office is quite small.

542
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
I'll work harder to get a bigger one soon.

543
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,320
Mum.

544
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,040
You've done visiting it.

545
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,120
What if you go home first?

546
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,440
You're off work soon, right?

547
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,080
Let's go home together.

548
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,960
Xiao Fei.

549
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,560
Please put this boxed meal in the fridge.

550
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,520
Don't eat it.

551
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,920
Don't worry, President Zuo.

552
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I'm leaving.

553
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,360
Sister-in-law.

554
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,040
Sister-in-law.

555
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,160
Ms Tian has left.

556
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,600
Really?

557
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Yes. She's left.

558
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,120
A boxed meal with love.

559
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,080
I'm sorry, President Su,

560
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
for asking you to have a meeting

561
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,280
right after you returned from Milan.

562
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,560
I'm sorry to bother your rest.

563
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,000
No worry.

564
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,760
Your company

565
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,680
bought Wan Feng's shares.

566
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,520
It means that

567
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,560
you're a shareholder of Wan Feng.

568
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,280
You have the right

569
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,200
to monitor

570
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,960
our projects.

571
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,160
No worry.

572
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
You're too humble.

573
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,040
You have the authority

574
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,080
in any project

575
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,280
and management of the company.

576
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Assisting you

577
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
is our role.

578
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,520
Let me get right to the point.

579
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Today,

580
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm here

581
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,240
to discuss your new project

582
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
again.

583
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
I still

584
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,880
have some doubts

585
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,640
about it.

586
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,880
No problem.

587
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,520
You may ask

588
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,280
whatever you want.

589
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,400
In every project,

590
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
once it passes the stage of novelty,

591
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
the next stage would be

592
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,560
the technical skills.

593
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
I believe that President Su

594
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,080
knows everything about Song Lin.

595
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
Regarding the technology,

596
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
there are not many companies

597
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,600
as outstanding

598
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,440
as his team.

599
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,560
I think that

600
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,680
you know it as well.

601
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,640
That's why you do your best

602
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,880
to stop his resources.

603
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,400
But he did

604
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
get

605
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,200
an excellent buyer

606
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
like your company, right?

607
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,880
I admit that Song Lin

608
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
is an expert of technology,

609
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,200
but it's our luck

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,280
as he found you all, right?

611
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,200
I think

612
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,840
the technological advancement

613
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,640
is temporary.

614
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,440
The success of a project

615
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,360
counts on

616
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,320
the time of launch

617
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,880
and marketing.

618
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,880
The acceptability of customers

619
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,240
is way more beneficial

620
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,920
than technology.

621
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,480
Am I right?

622
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
Based on my assessment,

623
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,560
there are still many loopholes

624
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,680
in the application of Wan Feng.

625
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,240
Be cautious.

626
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,160
I suggest

627
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,600
delaying the launch

628
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,760
of this application.

629
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,320
Of course.

630
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,360
I'll report it

631
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
to the other leaders of the company.

632
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Our company

633
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,320
takes a more careful approach

634
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,520
in our investment.

635
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,320
I hope you can understand, President Su.

636
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,800
I understand

637
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,240
your worries, Miss Ling Xi.

638
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
However,

639
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
since I'm the leader

640
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,400
of Wan Feng,

641
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,160
I won't allow

642
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,960
any mistake in Wan Feng.

643
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Sorry.

644
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,080
Your suggestion won't be considered.

645
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,240
Wu San.

646
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Do you know

647
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,120
where Song Lin is?

648
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,600
He returned to his hometown.

649
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
You're back too, Miss Fang?

650
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,560
Yes.

651
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
Qin Qing said that she wanted to return.

652
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,680
I wasn't interested

653
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,360
in staying longer there.

654
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,000
I see.

655
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,720
When did Song Lin leave?

656
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,480
He left right after you had left.

657
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay. No problem.

658
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,040
I'm going to hang up.

659
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:17,201
[Zhou Fang's calling]

660
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,720
Hey.

661
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,400
Hey.

662
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,680
How are you?

663
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm good. Not bad.

664
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,840
You returned to your grandma's house

665
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,120
without informing me?

666
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
I just went to visit my grandma.

667
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,480
I didn't tell you since you didn't ask.

668
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
What's wrong?

669
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,920
Nothing.

670
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,040
I didn't hear from you

671
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,200
recently.

672
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,320
So, I'm just curious

673
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,880
where you are

674
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,600
and what you're doing.

675
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,440
I'm

676
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
an idler

677
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,960
and I'm all alone.

678
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,920
You must be happy

679
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,680
about your trip to Milan, right?

680
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,800
You must have learned a lot.

681
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,040
I dared not to

682
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,560
call you.

683
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,640
Song Lin. Must you

684
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,720
talk with me like this?

685
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,320
What's wrong with you?

686
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,000
What have I done

687
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,680
upsetting you?

688
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,040
Can't you just tell me honestly?

689
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,040
It's better

690
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
than our current status.

691
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,440
I'm fine.

692
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,800
Nothing.

693
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm going to hang up.

694
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,791
[Zhou Fang]

695
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,920
Sorry.

696
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,960
I just don't want to involve you

697
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,880
in the war

698
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,600
between Su Yu Shan and me.

699
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,120
If you're by my side,

700
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,800
I'll definitely

701
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,560
tell you about everything.

702

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
won't stop you

704
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,960
from doing nothing.

705
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,480
President Ling.

706
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,200
President Ling.

707
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,760
Where is President Xu?

708
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,720
President Xu has been

709
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,560
waiting for you in your office.

710
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,160
But he looks angry.

711
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,640
Got it.

712
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,040
President Xu.

713
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,920
I'm disappointed with you.

714
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,080
Why aren't you

715
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,480
calm and steady now?

716
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,320
Your decision

717
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,840
was too aggressive!

718
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
You met President Su

719
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,840
without calling

720
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
an internal meeting.

721
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,360
What a unilateral decision!

722
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,480
I've been investigating

723
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,560
the project of Wan Feng,

724
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,240
and I found some loopholes.

725
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,680
That's why I advised
President Su to delay the launch.

726
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,960
I did it

727
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,960
for the company

728
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,840
and the project.

729
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
No matter what,

730
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,720
you should notify the company

731
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,040
and discuss internally

732
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,760
before contact Su Yu Shan.

733
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,600
It looks like Su Yu Shan

734
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,160
didn't

735
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,240
accept my suggestion,

736
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,520
and he reported it

737
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,440
to you.

738
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
Come. Have a seat.

739
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,960
Ling Xi.

740
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,720
I know that,

741
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,360
you might be

742
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,200
too stressful recently.

743
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,760
Your subjective assumption

744
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,000
has affected

745
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,040
your professional assessment.

746
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,800
Go home

747
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,760
for a rest first.

748
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,200
What do you mean?

749
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't get it.

750
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,440
You've been taking care of me

751
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
for years.

752
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,520
Just be frank.

753
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,840
Don't beat around the bush.

754
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,280
Alright.

755
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,920
I don't hide it from you anymore.

756
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
Before Su Yu Shan went to Milan,

757
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,800
he'd met me.

758
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
He

759
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,840
indirectly accused you

760
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,040
of leaking business secrets.

761
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,280
You meet Song Lin

762
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,560
too often.

763
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,840
Shareholders

764
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,640
are aware of it.

765
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
They aren't happy for sure.

766
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,960
I understand

767
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,840
the rules of

768
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,520
business.

769
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,560
I've assessed

770
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,320
so many projects without failure

771
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,280
for the company.

772
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,880
Why would I

773
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,200
harm our company?

774
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,440
We acknowledge

775
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,280
your performance.

776
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
But in this matter,

777
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
you've turned into

778
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,600
a thorn in the side

779
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,480
of Su Yu Shan.

780
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,280
All the directors

781
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,920
agree on his project.

782
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,680
Nothing else

783
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,360
could be changed.

784
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,160
Taking leaves

785
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,840
is the best

786
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,880
option for you now.

787
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,960
How about the follow-up

788
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,640
of Wan Feng project?

789
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,880
Don't worry.

790
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,440
I have got someone to handle it.

791
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I would like to ask

792
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,360
if really no one has

793
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,320
verified my doubts?

794
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,520
It looks like

795
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,560
you have been convinced

796
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
by Su Yu Shan.

797
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,080
Okay.

798
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,200
Thank you

799
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,800
for your guidance.

800
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,520
But I have my principles.

801
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,600
If my doubts

802
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,920
aren't acknowledged by the company,

803
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,080
I'll do my best

804
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,200
to prove that

805
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm right.

806
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
I'll send you my resignation letter later.

807
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,480
See you again.

808
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,160
Why are you in such a hurry to meet me?

809
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,720
You've been fired?

810
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,040
Almost.

811
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh, right.

812
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,920
Has your USA visa

813
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,480
expired?

814
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,600
Not yet.

815
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,800
What's wrong?

816
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Why were you fired?

817
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,960
It's difficult to explain it.

818
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,120
I'll book a flight

819
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,040
to the United States.

820
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,080
I'll tell you more later.

821
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,040
No.

822
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,280
What's wrong with you?

823
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,600
Since you were fired,

824
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,840
why will we go to the USA?

825
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
Your company doesn't want to finance?

826
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,480
But why go to the United States?

827
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,160
Okay.

828
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,160
I've found

829
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,200
some companies there,

830
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,440
We've agreed to discuss it in two days.

831
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
It's the only chance.

832
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's up to you to go or not.

833
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,480
You...

834
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,440
Just go to the United States like this?

835
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,600
Miss Fang.

836
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,120
Wu San.

837
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,360
Why are you here?

838
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,720
Great.

839
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,240
I want to ask you something.

840
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,800
How's

841
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,680
your company doing now?

842
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,160
It is fine.

843
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,240
Lin didn't

844
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,320
say anything about it.

845
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,200
What's wrong with you?

846
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,720
Nothing. I'm just asking.

847
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,120
Is Song Lin here?

848
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,880
I want to meet him.

849
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,880
Miss Fang.

850
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,360
Lin and Ling Xi

851
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
went to the United States last night.

852
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,160
It's something

853
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,960
urgent.

854
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Didn't he tell you?

855
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,600
I see.

856
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,000
Alright. You carry on.

857
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,840
I go back first.

858
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,760
Miss Fang.

859
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,720
Give me a call

860
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,320
if you need anything.

861
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,000
Sure.

862
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,120
That house looks good.

863
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes.

864
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,760
This house

865
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
is valuable.

866
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,120
Later, we talk about it

867
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
after back to the company.

868
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,400
Sure.

869
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,040
Someone is to visit the house?

870
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,360
What a coincidence, miss.

871
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,920
The landlord of your house

872
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,240
takes good care of the house.

873
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
My client is quite interested in it.

874
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,200
Song Lin?

875
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
Is he selling?

876
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,680
I'm not sure.

877
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,120
He put on the sign board last night.

878
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,080
It's urgently for sale.

879
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
The price is attractive.

880
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,040
My client is interested in it too.

881
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,520
I got something to do, miss.

882
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,560
We'll make a move first.

883
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,040
Alright.

884
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,760
Come.

885
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,440
This is the information

886
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,320
of the American companies.

887
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,680
Tonight,

888
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,320
we must

889
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,480
get the business proposal done.

890
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
What?

891
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,480
I ask you to read the info.

892
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,280
Why are you looking at me?

893
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,520
Knowing each other well

894
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,480
to win.

895
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,760
No. What a long haul just now.

896
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,920
I haven't eaten anything.

897
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,120
Let's eat first, okay?

898
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
But

899
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,560
we're in a hurry.

900
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,920
Health

901
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,040
is more important than that.

902
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,280
I'm fainting.

903
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,280
Okay. I'll order something for you.

904
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,840
Have a cup of coffee.

905
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,160
Okay.

906
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Check it out.

907
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,560
Not bad.

908
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,120
I've never expected that

909
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,680
I need to prepare materials

910
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,960
after managing a company for years.

911
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,560
Sorry.

912
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,640
I've fallen asleep.

913
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,520
It's fine. Sleepy, right?

914
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,320
I'm sleepy as well.

915
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,080
The business proposal

916
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,960
has been done.

917
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,760
Later, Xiao Fei

918
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
will fly here.

919
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,480
Let them talk about

920
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,200
the professional things.

921
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
It's beyond my ability.

922
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,640
I think that

923
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,080
I didn't pick the wrong person.

924
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,200
You didn't pick the wrong company

925
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,560
and project.

926
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,960
I've told you that our project

927
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,880
worth to invest.

928
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,680
By the way,

929
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,440
I don't mean to invade

930
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,160
your privacy,

931
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,640
but I heard

932
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,600
you ask

933
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,400
a real estate agent

934
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,520
to sell

935
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,240
your house now.

936
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,720
I need money.

937
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,120
Make a call to him to cancel it.

938
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,040
You don't have to

939
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,160
sell your house.

940
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,160
It's an insult

941
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,520
to my profession.

942
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,960
Since I've chosen

943
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,880
your team,

944
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,280
it means that I trust your ability.

945
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,920
So, you don't have to

946
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,560
sell your house.

947
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,960
I'll go back first.

948
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,600
Tell me if Xiao Fei arrives.

949
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,560
Sure.

950
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Go to sleep.

951
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,400
Thank you. Thank you.

952
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,320
Cancel the sale.

953
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,200
Okay.

954
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:11,265
[Zhou Fang: Why didn't you tell me before
going to the USA? You're selling your house?]

955
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,972
[Song Lin: It's urgent. I'll explain it
to you later. Don't be angry.]

956
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I can't bear it.

957
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,360
I think the neckline

958
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,000
is too stiff.

959
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,000
It can be improved,

960
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,120
so that the line

961
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,920
will look better.

962
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,200
Really.

963
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,760
Okay, modify it.

964
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,360
Sure.

965
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
Miss Tang.

966
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,880
What's wrong?

967
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,680
This is the latest order.

968
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,720
I've recorded

969
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,520
the tailoring appointment

970
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,440
of the customers.

971
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,800
Please verify it later.

972
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,480
Sure.

973
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm telling you.

974
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
Idols

975
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,680
are really powerful.

976
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,680
Since the boy group

977
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,600
wore our clothes

978
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,280
in the music award,

979
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,520
we have some

980
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,000
new teen customers

981
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,880
who are their fans.

982
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
To order school shirts?

983
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,760
No. Formal dresses.

984
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,200
I tell you.

985
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,320
Their families

986
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,200
must be rich.

987
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,800
You never know that

988
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,960
they often join

989
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,760
banquets and parties.

990
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,120
They really enjoy themselves.

991
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,320
I see.

992
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,440
What are you two talking about?

993
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,080
Make a guess?

994
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,280
Please carry on.

995
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,960
I'm going downstairs

996
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
to deliver the goods.

997
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,680
Okay.

998
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,320
Miss Fang.

999
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,560
Someone's for the position of a tailor.

1000
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,960
Hello. I'm Zhou Fang,

1001
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,840
the person in charge here.

1002
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,160
Fu Chun Lai.

1003
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,400
Do you have your resume?

1004
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,720
Resume?

1005
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,120
Don't have a resume.

1006
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
It's in my hands and brain.

1007
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
My grandpa,

1008
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,920
my dad and I,

1009
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,160
we're tailors

1010
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,880
for three generations.

1011
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,200
We basically

1012
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,880
make western-style clothes

1013
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,920
I wish to apply

1014
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,760
for the position of tailor here.

1015
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,880
Your background is great.

1016
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Since you're the third generation

1017
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,800
as a tailor in your family,

1018
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,040
you are supposed to own a shop.

1019
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,720
Why would you

1020
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,400
come to us?

1021
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,760
It's not earning.

1022
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,760
I want to buy houses.

1023
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,480
I need to feed myself.

1024
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,280
Then, let's check out your skills.

1025
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,680
No big deal.

1026
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,160
What about

1027
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,000
I make one for you?

1028
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,560
It's too time-consuming

1029
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,600
to make a product.

1030
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,680
Alright.

1031
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,640
You are responsible for the

1032
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,440
the cutting and sewing

1033
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,200
of this shirt now.

1034
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,800
Sure.

1035
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,400
Not bad.

1036
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,480
Best cooperation.

1037
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
The details of cooperation

1038
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,400

[TKY Shop]

1049

Seniors,

1050
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,000
this is

1051

our new home from now on.

How is it?

It's great, right?

1054

00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,720
But, as a senior,

1056
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,640
TKY

1057
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,720
deserves it.

1058
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,600
Oh, my gosh!

1059
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,000
This location.

1060
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,920
How much is the rental?

1061
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,400
Miss Fang.

1062
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,280
Our company

1063
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,400
is so rich?

1064
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,280
This area

1065
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,240
is provided by Bai Sai.

1066
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,000
For free.

1067
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,360
What a steal!

1068
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,160
Miss Fang is really something.

1069
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,000
This couch!

1070
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,520
Miss Fang.

1071
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
The taste and the design

1072
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,560
are great.

1073
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,560
Try this, Tang Jie.

1074
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,480
It's so comfortable.

1075
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,160
I don't want to get up.

1076
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,680
It's really good.

1077
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,200
Right?

1078
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,080
Zhou Fang.

1079
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,840
You're here, President Su?

1080
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,440
You designed

1081
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,280
the shop well.

1082
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,880
That's right.

1083
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,640
It's a great environment

1084
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,200
for a designer.

1085
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,280
You're a great help, President Su.

1086
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,520
My pleasure.

1087
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Let's have a talk.

1088
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,840
How about going to a coffee cafe?

1089
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:06,840
Sure.

1090
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,880
Welcome to Bestore.

1091
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,640
The organizer told me that

1092
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,800
the jewels I designed

1093
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,680
are popular.

1094
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,960
Today, I received

1095
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,480
an order

1096
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,120
from them.

1097
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,560
That's great.

1098
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,480
Congratulations, sweetheart.

1099
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,760
I didn't expect it.

1100
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm so excited.

1101
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,600
That's great.

1102
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,360
Don't overwork yourself.

1103
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,320
Take some nuts.

1104
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,640
You make designs.

1105
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,480
It must have racked your brain.

1106
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,120
You bought too many.

1107
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
I can't finish them.

1108
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,760
Take more if you like.

1109
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,560
Besides,

1110
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,800
sorry to let you wronged.

1111
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,520
I should do something.

1112
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
I'm fine.

1113
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,640
Let's go.

1114
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,120
About the opening of your new store,

1115
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,280
let me know

1116
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,840
if you need any help.

1117
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,680
Everything's fine now.

1118
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,320
The staff can handle

1119
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,360
the remaining small issues.

1120
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,320
Is Song Lin doing well
in the United States?

1121
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,440
I'm too busy recently

1122
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,360
to catch up with him.

1123
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,400
How did you know that

1124
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,120
he went there, President Su?

1125
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
It's not difficult

1126
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,880
to know it in this industry.

1127
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,480
I must thank you

1128
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,560
for not leaving us

1129
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,880
because of the

1130
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
competition between Song Lin and me.

1131
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,760
Don't worry.

1132
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,360
I'm someone who would return kindness.

1133
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,440
I won't treat you badly.

1134
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,360
Competition? You and Song Lin?

1135
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,920
Don't you know it?

1136
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,960
Song Lin is calm enough.

1137
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,120
He didn't tell you

1138
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,800
about it.

1139
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,440
Yes.

1140
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,560
Song Lin and I are competitors.

1141
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,040
We compete for

1142
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,960
the development of technology.

1143
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,440
He's at advantage of it.

1144
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,960
However,

1145
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,160
he has no advantage

1146
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,040
in capital operation.

1147
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,040
He'll lose.

1148
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,040
However, someone is helping him,

1149
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,720
such as Ling Xi.

1150
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,760
She left us

1151
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,080
for Song Lin.

1152
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,720
They are quite similar

1153
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,240
