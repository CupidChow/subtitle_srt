[Episode 42]

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,600
A marriage proposal?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,320
Basically, our parents will meet each other,

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,240
and then we'll get a marriage certificate.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
It's such a rush.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,720
By the way,

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,360
the other day,

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
I just casually brought

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
that up.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,080
I didn't expect things to end up this way.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,600
I simply expected that

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,360
she could pay more attention to you,

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
so that the two of you would

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,760
have more time to get along,

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
and that I would plan

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
to change her mind slowly.

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,160
I didn't expect that Zuo

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,360
would jump the gun.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,479
Now the main problem is that

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,800
Ms Tian thinks

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,880
she's going to be

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,880
a grandma in a few months.

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
So you have to work hard for that.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,120
But

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,320
there's

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
no other way.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,520
Wu San has a point.

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,200
But I still think

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,040
it isn't great.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
After all, we lied to Ms Tian.

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
What do you do then?

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
Just being stuck there?

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,720
Even someone as

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,600
honest as Wu San

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,640
had to resort to this tactic

60
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,600
because of his mother.

61
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,560
I assume he did this also to remind

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
himself to never fail you,

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
and there won't be more issues in the future.

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,320
I can understand his concern.

65
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
I know that

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Wu San did this

67
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
to ease my mind.

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,320
But

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,880
I...

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,120
Qing.

71
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,080
It is what it is now.

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,640
So you need to think about, from now on,

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
treating Ms Tian nicely.

74
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,120
Ms Tian has worked so hard

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
in her whole life to

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,080
raise

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,360
a child on her own.

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
Actually, someone like her

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,200
cares a lot about how others treat her.

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,240
The only thing that matters is your sincerity.

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Well... Should I get married then?

82
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,800
What else can you do?

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Other than this,

84
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,320
you have

85
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,000
no other way.

86
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
What other solutions do you have now?

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,480
If you come clean

88
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,680
about all the lies you told

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
in the past,

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
what would happen to the two of you?

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
That's no good.

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Yeah.

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
Since Ms Tian has taken

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
the first step,

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,240
you and Wu San

96
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,440
should get married first.

97
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,720
After that,

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,680
you can slowly

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,360
make it up to her.

100
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
I think Zhou Fang has

101
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,440
a point.

102
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,960
That's all you can do.

103
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,680
Yeah.

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,440
Mom.

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,280
Let me help you.

106
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Why do you keep

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,080
dropping by lately?

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,520
Do you have

109
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,920
anything to ask from me or what?

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Why can't I

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,080
come home?

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
Isn't this my home?

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Stop being so smart-mouthed.

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,960
Why isn't Song Lin with you?

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,200
That's not respectful of him.

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
Mum, stop nitpicking.

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Or else he'll leave me.

118
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,600
That's a bluff. How dare you.

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
Old Li.

120
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
Hi, Auntie Liu.

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,160
Zhou Fang is back.

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,120
I haven't got to seen you these days.

123
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,240
You're a famous designer.

124
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
Well, no.

125
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm not there yet.

126
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,800
I think

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,240
you're better off the way you are now.

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,560
Young women shouldn't be

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
too ambitious,

130
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,840
or you'll scare men away.

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,280
Look at my daughter.

132
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,040
She's a homemaker.

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,200
She has a simple and happy family.

134
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,280
I went away to make a call.

135
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,920
Let me take it.

136
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,880
Is it heavy?

137
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,440
It's alright.

138
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,080
Does it hurt your hand?

139
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,760
No.

140
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Auntie.

141
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,240
If you go to the supermarket,

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,840
give me a call.

143
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,560
I'll fetch you.

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,760
You're so busy.

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,640
I don't want to trouble you.

146
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,960
My work is not as important as you.

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,920
From now on, if you call me,

148
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,520
I'll head over right away.

149
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,040
This young man...

150
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,360
Fine.

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,120
I'll call you.

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Hey, this young man

153
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,320
looks quite familiar.

154
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,760
Is that right?

155
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,040
You...

156
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,360
Have you been on TV?

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
A few times, for work.

158
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,240
I remember now.

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,280
Old Li, he's a

160
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,560
successful businessman.

161
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,280
Successful businessman?

162
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I get to see

163
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,520
you in person.

164
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,840
You're young, handsome, and talented.

165
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,040
How impressive.

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,280
That's amazing.

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,080
It's nothing.

168
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,760
I've always thought

169
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,800
that I'm not good enough for Zhou Fang.

170
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Not good enough.

171
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,360
Am I right?

172
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,120
No.

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
You're excellent.

174
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Well.

175
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,480
Both of you are excellent.

176
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,840
I think a woman should be

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
more confident and successful.

178
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,400
She will be able to

179
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,000
find a better boyfriend.

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
Let's go home.

181
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
Okay. Let's go. Let's head back.

182
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
Bye, Auntie Liu.

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Bye, auntie.

184
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,800
Let's go.

185
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,600
Please teach me how to cook, auntie.

186
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
Zhou Fang has been complaining about my cooking.

187
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Auntie Liu is a good person

188
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
overall.

189
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,640
She just has a sharp tongue,

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
especially since she has

191
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,440
become a grandma.

192
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
She keeps needling me about

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
the fact that you're still unmarried.

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,520
It's so annoying.

195
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,240
Today Song Lin

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,280
must have come at the right time.

197
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,000
You must be exalted.

198
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,880
You've done well today.

199
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
You deserve to be praised.

200
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,000
Auntie, do you go dancing with

201
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,880
Auntie Liu?

202
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Sometimes.

203
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
When you go dancing next time,

204
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,400
call me over.

205
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
You can show me off.

206
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,120
You know the square dancing?

207
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Of course, I do, auntie.

208
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,920
If you come along, you will be very

209
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
popular.

210
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,560
Song.

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
I've been expecting you every day.

212
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
I keep staring at the chessboard.

213
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
I couldn't play without an opponent.

214
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm a little busy lately.

215
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
I couldn't visit you.

216
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,720
Song.

217
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,480
Let's go. Play chess with me now.

218
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Okay.

219
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,440
What are you doing?

220
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,000
Are you stealing him away?

221
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
We're just going to play chess.

222
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,880
Don't worry.

223
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
Song has promised to

224
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,800
help us cook.

225
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,400
Look at that.

226
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,080
What a turn of events.

227
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
Now she has learned to steal from me.

228
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
I am not trying to steal him from you.

229
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,600
Alright. I won't fight you.

230
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,280
Let Song decide himself.

231
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,840
Song, tell us.

232
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,760
Do you want to play chess with him

233
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,960
or stay here and cook with me?

234
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
Well, I...

235
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm fine either way.

236
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,280
Why are you looking at me?

237
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,600
It's not me whom they are

238
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
fighting over.

239
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Well, Uncle.

240
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,200
Let us cook now. We should eat first.

241
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,120
Yeah.

242
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,200
You should eat first.

243
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
You're so weird.

244
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,960
Song, do your best.

245
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,760
I'm coming over.

246
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,200
This way, please.

247
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
Ms Tian, please take a seat.

248
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,240
No, no. no.

249
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,760
You first.

250
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Drop the formality, Ms Tian.

251
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,520
Thank you.

252
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,600
Please take a seat here.

253
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,200
Time flies.

254
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
It seems that we haven't seen each other

255
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,280
for ten years.

256
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

257
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
Look, although I haven't seen you for so long,

258
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,680
you two still look young.

259
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Nothing changes.

260
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
You're too kind.

261
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Our children are already

262
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,480
to get married.

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Of course,

264
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
we've grown old.

265
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
By the way, I heard from Lin Lin that

266
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,400
you had surgery a few months ago.

267
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
Are you feeling well now?

268
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm fine.

269
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,880
I'll be fine as long as I have

270
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
regular checkups.

271
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,360
Thank you.

272
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,360
Zuo helped us a lot

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,640
during that time.

274
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,240
We owe that to him.

275
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,240
That was what he should do.

276
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
He's a man.

277
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
He has to be dependable.

278
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,240
From now on,

279
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
if you ever need something,

280
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,760
you can ask him to do.

281
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,240
Zuo is more mature and

282
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,280
dependable than

283
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
other young men of his age.

284
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Ms Tian,

285
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,480
you've taught him well.

286
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,120
You're too kind.

287
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,400
Wait a minute.

288
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
Qing Qing.

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,640
You can't have

290
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,400
iced drink in this moment?

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,600
Lin Lin.

292
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,360
Get warm water for Qin Qing.

293
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,360
Okay.

294
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,920
Look at these kids.

295
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
They know nothing.

296
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,320
To be honest, Ms Tian,

297
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,400
when we learned

298
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,960
that

299
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,920
Zuo is your son,

300
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
we were quite shocked.

301
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Did you feel the same shock

302
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,920
as we did?

303
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,640
Yes.

304
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,120
But it turns out that

305
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,040
our families

306
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,240
are fated to be together.

307
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

308
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,160
At first

309
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,120
I also thought It was fate.

310
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
But you can tell

311
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,840
our family is not as wealthy as yours.

312
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,320
Qin Qing may not

313
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
get used to it.

314
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,080
No.

315
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,240
Ms Tian,

316
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
I think that as long as

317
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
our children love

318
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,480
each other,

319
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,600
hold the same view on life,

320
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,960
and are able to understand

321
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
or accept each other's fault,

322
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,040
and support

323
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
each other's career,

324
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,920
that's enough.

325
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,720
Zuo is self-motivated

326
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,520
and responsible.

327
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,480
I believe

328
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,400
that he'll certainly take

329
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
his career to the next level.

330
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,520
Indeed.

331
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,680
Everything is fine as long as they love

332
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
each other and live a good life.

333
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Ms Tian,

334
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,760
I know that our daughter Qin Qing

335
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,720
always gave you

336
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,880
trouble when she was small.

337
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,440
But as you can see,

338
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,240
she has become

339
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,160
more mature

340
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,120
and more dependable.

341
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,280
She's very

342
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,640
serious about her career.

343
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,600
She works very hard.

344
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
Actually, as her parents,

345
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,320
we don't expect her to

346
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,280
become rich and successful.

347
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,880
Our biggest wish is

348
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,080
that she'll be able to

349
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,720
find a good man and

350
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,480
start

351
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
her own family

352
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,640
and

353
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,040
live happily

354
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,160
ever after.

355
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,040
That's all.

356
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Yes.

357
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,960
As long as they are happy together,

358
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm happy.

359
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,920
Since you two are fine

360
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
with their relationship,

361
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
we must set the date

362
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,600
as soon as possible.

363
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
It's not easy to get married these days.

364
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
You have to throw a banquet.

365
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,520
It's quite troublesome.

366
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,040
Yes.

367
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,280
We can't wait any longer.

368
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,040
It'll be awkward

369
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,800
when Qin Qing's bump appears.

370
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,040
Mom.

371
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,240
So that's basically what happened.

372
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,880
Sorry.

373
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
I should have

374
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
told you about this.

375
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,320
If you did,

376
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
I wouldn't meet her at all.

377
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,200
Mom, don't be angry.

378
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,600
Ms Tian treats me

379
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,400
quite well.

380
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,120
Does she?

381
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
If Zuo didn't lie to her,

382
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,080
would she agree?

383
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,560
Besides, a girl like you is

384
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,040
good enough

385
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,200
for her son.

386
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
She's still so picky.

387
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
No.

388
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
She has nothing

389
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,120
against me.

390
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,120
She just worries

391
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,840
that other people will think

392
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,800
her family is not good enough for us.

393
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
That's why she hesitates.

394
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,280
Stop defending her.

395
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,280
Calm down.

396
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,280
Anyway,

397
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
Zuo is a nice kid.

398
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
Nothing matters as long as they love each other,

399
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,400
we

400
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,240
shouldn't dwell on that too much.

401
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,880
I'm not dwelling on anything.

402
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
I'm just worried

403
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,880
that my daughter will be bullied.

404
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,760
Mom.

405
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,880
I won't get bullied.

406
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,520
After we get married,

407
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,960
we'll move out, just the two of us.

408
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,960
Besides,

409
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
I have you two on my side.

410
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,280
No one dares to bully me.

411
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
Right, Dad?

412
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,600
You can hit me.

413
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,120
If you're still angry,

414
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
you can hit me to let it out.

415
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,200
Silly child. Don't be ridiculous.

416
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,280
Bad news, President Su.

417
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,600
Someone hacked into our system and

418
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
gained the highest security clearance.

419
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,880
The RD and PR departments

420
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
are coming up with countermeasures.

421
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,400
We're waiting for your final decision.

422
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Understood.

423
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,080
You may go now.

424
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,360
Miss Fang,

425
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,440
President Song treats you so well.

426
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,520
He even bought you a closet from Suofeiya.

427
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,240
Now

428
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,280
You can put the clothes

429
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,320
you design there.

430
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,280
You like it?

431
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah.

432
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,920
Ask your boyfriend to buy one

433
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,840
for you then.

434
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,400
I...

435
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,720
I haven't

436
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
found a boyfriend.

437
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,400
Hi, this is Zhou Fang.

438
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Hi, President Zhou.

439
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,560
There's a data breach at Chuang Pin Net.

440
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,600
Customer info has been leaked.

441
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,600
There might be some

442
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,560
issues with the orders we received.

443
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,240
What? Customer info has been leaked?

444
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

445
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,880
President Su is trying to fix it.

446
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,000
He told me to inform

447
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,920
all the brands on the platform.

448
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,680
We anticipate

449
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,320
a huge drop in

450
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,240
the number of our online customers.

451
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,600
Okay. I understand.

452
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,400
You You.

453
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
Call Izumino over.

454
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,760
It's

455
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
a big opportunity for us.

456
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,760
Su Yu Shan needs time to fix

457
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
the website.

458
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,880
We can seize the

459
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
chance to draw their customers.

460
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,440
I agree with President Sun.

461
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,600
This is certainly

462
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,120
a huge

463
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
opportunity for us.

464
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,760
If we make sure

465
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,920
nothing wrong with the APP,

466
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,080
and actively promote our platform to

467
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,920
to attract customers,

468
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
we'll dominate the market.

469
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,080
This is great.

470
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,000
Unexpectedly,

471
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,760
this old fox, Su Yu Shan,

472
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,280
got

473
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,200
himself into such a big mess.

474
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
We can take this

475
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
opportunity to promote our platform.

476
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,520
But

477
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,520
in our line of business,

478
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
there's no such thing as a coincidence.

479
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,240
Besides, we have no idea

480
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
what happened to Su Yu Shan's company or

481
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
who's behind it.

482
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,240
Now we've

483
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,320
become

484
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
the prime suspect.

485
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,560
Yeah.

486
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,560
Therefore, from now on,

487
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,840
we should be cautious.

488
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,920
Don't worry, President Song.

489
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,560
We'll increase our

490
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,120
security measures.

491
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,680
What's going on?

492
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,040
There's a customer data leak at Chuang Pin Net,

493
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,520
including

494
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,400
our orders.

495
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,680
What the heck?

496
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,080
How did that happen?

497
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,320
Should we finish the orders?

498
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes.

499
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,400
We've already received the orders.

500
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,640
All we can do is to finish them.

501
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
Who's going to wear them?

502
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,640
These

503
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,760
are all customized orders.

504
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,800
We'll sell to the ones who ordered.

505
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,400
Since

506
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,240
the data breach

507
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,560
is the brand's and platform's problem,

508
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,960
it has nothing to do with the customers.

509
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,680
Besides, if they cancel orders,

510
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,760
there's no use to keep

511
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,520
these clothes around.

512
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,760
All we can do is to thank

513
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,200
them

514
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,960
for their support.

515
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,640
Hopefully, we'll work with them in the future.

516
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,200
Alright. You're the boss.

517
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,640
President Su.

518
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,760
The tech department is

519
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,360
racing against time

520
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,200
to fix the breach.

521
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,480
But the information leak has caused

522
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,280
a chain of issues.

523
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,840
It's more important to focus on

524
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,880
how to solve them.

525
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,120
There must be

526
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,920
someone

527
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,360
behind the data leak,

528
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,240
because hackers wouldn't do things

529
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
without getting paid.

530
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,800
I think

531
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,760
Song Lin must have something to do with it.

532
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,280
After all, our companies

533
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,440
have quite a history.

534
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,640
Our companies

535
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,160
are

536
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,520
currently the big players in the market.

537
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,360
If we fall,

538
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
he'll dominate the market.

539
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,320
So, President Su,

540
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,000
This time, we can't go easy on him.

541
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,560
Shut down the online
tailoring platform temporarily.

542
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Fixing the security breach

543
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
doesn't take much time.

544
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,360
We don't need to shut it down.

545
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,280
The platform is

546
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,360
only a small part

547
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,400
of our business.

548
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,960
We can't risk ruining

549
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,440
the company's reputation

550
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,360
because of this.

551
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,520
Conduct a thorough investigation.

552
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,720
I want to know

553
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
who's the culprit

554
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
to steal

555
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,640
our customers' info,

556
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,079
so that we can give

557
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,839
our consumers an explanation.

558
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,560
As for our competitors,

559
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,400
try to stall them and prevent them

560
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,680
from taking advantage of our crisis.

561
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,119
Yes. Understood.

562
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,520
That's it for now.

563
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,920
Are you alright lately?

564
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,080
I think I'll never come here again.

565
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,040
Why?

566
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm really tired.

567
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,040
If you're tired,

568
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,320
slow down and enjoy your time.

569
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
Isn't that a good thing?

570
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
I said the same thing to him,

571
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,280
but he isn't

572
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,160
willing to slow down to keep my company.

573
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,920
I've thought it through.

574
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
I want a divorce.

575
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,360
President Su,

576
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,480
thank you for accepting our

577
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,280
interview.

578
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,880
Regarding the leak of the

579
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Fitting Room users' private

580
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
information,

581
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,280
do you have

582
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,200
anything to say to the customers?

583
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,760
First of all,

584
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,840
I wish to offer a sincere

585
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,600
apology to all my customers.

586
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,840
The Fitting Room

587
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,840
was only operated

588
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,720
on Chuang Pin Net.

589
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
This crisis is partly due to

590
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,560
the fact that we weren't well-prepared

591
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,920
enough in terms of online security.

592
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,800
I don't allow

593
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,560
my customers' privacy

594
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,480
to be violated again.

595
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,040
May I know if you had

596
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,960
expected a crisis concerning

597
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,160
the leak of private info

598
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
at the Fitting Room?

599
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,960
In the era of Big Data,

600
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,400
there's no fixed solution to

601
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
the issues of online security.

602
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,520
I don't think there's such thing

603
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
as the perfect online security system.

604
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Any firewall

605
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,600
can be broken down,

606
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,240
including Linfang Technology's.

607
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,240
But we'll certainly try our best

608
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,280
to create the best security system.

609
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,040
Now that the problem has surfaced,

610
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
do you think that you're

611
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,120
undeniably

612
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,480
responsible for this issue?

613
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,040
Yes.

614
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
I'll take responsibility for it.

615
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,200
This crisis also

616
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,280
serves as a reminder for us.

617
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
From now on,

618
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,080
we'll put the focus on

619
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,240
online security measures to

620
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,480
to protect consumers' privacy.

621
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,720
I also want to warn

622
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,360
the person who stole customers' info

623
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,280
that I'll give them

624
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
the most severe consequences.

625
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,640
President Song,

626
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,640
Su Yu Shan is obviously

627
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,400
trying to

628
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
drag us down

629
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,880
with him.

630
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,080
You must not panic.

631
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
We have to hold our ground.

632
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,120
Wait. Why aren't you

633
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,280
worried at all?

634
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,360
We're not as powerful as

635
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
how we used to be.

636
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,040
In what way?

637
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Old team. High tech.

638
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,440
Besides, we have more funding now.

639
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,680
In fact, we're better now,

640
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,040
except for you.

641
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,960
You've lost faith in me.

642
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,880
Definitely not.

643
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,240
I swear.

644
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,040
I trust you

645
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,520
1,000 percent.

646
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm just worried

647
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,600
our competitor will play tricks.

648
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
Alright. Cut the nonsense.

649
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,860
A while ago,

650
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
I watched you suffer a huge loss.

651
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,640
I'm still

652
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,440
upset about it.

653
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,080
We just make sure the software is perfect

654
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,040
and create

655
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,120
the best user experience.

656
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,200
It'll be a victory for us.

657
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
It doesn't matter what others say.

658
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,280
Understood?

659
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,280
Get back to work.

660
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,380
[Divorce Agreement]

661
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,720
Hello.

662
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,600
Stop the spread of negative news.

663
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,520
Slow them down.

664
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,360
I believe that

665
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,560
many people have been waiting for this day

666
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,520
to add insult to our injury.

667
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,200
Don't worry.

668
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,800
Help me keep

669
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,600
an eye on the updates,

670
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,480
to prevent a chain effect.

671
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,600
I got it. That's it for now.

672
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,800
Sleeping on the couch again?

673
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,080
Get up. Get up.

674
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
Sleep in the room. Let's go.

675
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,520
I don't want to move.

676
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,320
Come over.

677
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Is everything okay?

678
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,400
There are too many orders.

679
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Isn't there

680
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
something wrong with Chuang Pin Net?

681
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,560
Why do you still have so many orders?

682
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,080
But the orders earlier

683
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,160
have already been processed.

684
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,720
We can't cancel them now.

685
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
All we can do is to finish them.

686
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
Do you need my help with

687
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,560
anything then?

688
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,360
Do you know how to massage?

689
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,360
Of course, I do. Which part?

690
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,680
You know, I'm also

691
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,200
an esteemed business owner,

692
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,680
right?

693
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,840
I have money and resources.

694
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,280
Why don't you utilize our connection?

695
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,440
I'm doing that now, am I not?

696
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,680
The pressure you are using is just right.

697
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,760
And your hands are soft.

698
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,600
You'll surely

699
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,840
become a good masseur.

700
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,120
Talk to me if you're upset.

701
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,040
Don't keep everything to yourself.

702
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,040
Song Lin,

703
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,080
tell me

704
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,360
why you and Su Yu Shan can't

705
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,520
co-exist and help each other?

706
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
Must you

707
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
compete against one another?

708
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,880
That's the competition.

709
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
That's how the market works.

710
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,680
If you want to achieve a win-win situation,

711
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,120
either of us has to compromise and

712
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,000
signs of good faith first.

713
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,680
Even if one side

714
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,040
is willing to do that,

715
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,520
another party might not

716
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,480
agree to make peace.

717
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,640
But for you, I'm willing to give it a try.

718
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,240
I don't want you to sacrifice for me.

719
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,400
Besides, even if you're willing to make peace,

720
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,080
Su Yu Shan

721
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,800
might not agree with it.

722
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,720
He's not as forgiving as me.

723
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,200
I'll massage the leg.

724
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
Drink some War Horse to stay sharp.

725
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,880
Thanks.

726
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
How's the

727
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
firewall test?

728
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,640
The security risk

729
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,800
is higher than I expected.

730
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,360
Our system is not advanced enough.

731
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,480
Thanks for your hard work.

732
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,800
My duty.

733
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,560
Is it possible

734
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,200
to create

735
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
a smart security system that

736
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,880
it would update itself periodically?

737
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,160
It's not impossible.

738
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,800
But currently,

739
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,720
we still have to do it manually.

740
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,160
Later on, after

741
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,800
the firewall test,

742
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,160
I'll look at the data analysis,

743
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,400
and figure out how to do it.

744
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
A little lower.

745
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,160
You have so many requests.

746
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
Do you want a massage too?

747
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,840
Aren't you tired already?

748
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,400
Lie down.

749
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,520
It's fine.

750
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,000
Lie down now.

751
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,680
Lie down.

752
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,600
I have to lie down?

753
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,040
There.

754
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,400
Mr Song.

755
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
Please close your eyes.

756
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,600
Close my eyes.

757
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,760
How does it feel?

758
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,520
Not bad.

759
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,960
By the way,

760
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,680
Qin Qing and Wu San are getting married.

761
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,840
What about you?

762
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,320
What about me?

763
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,000
Do you want to get married?

764
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,120
You're

765
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,520
a public figure.

766
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,480
If you don't have a big diamond ring

767
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,400
when you propose,

768
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,320
do you think I'll say yes?

769
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,320
If I take out

770
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,520
a big diamond ring,

771
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,800
will you say yes?

772
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Why don't you guess?

773
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,440
I don't want to.

774
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,680
I don't plan to propose.

775
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,600
You're so mean.

776
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,720
What are you doing?

777
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,240
Don't run.

778
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
Lin Lin, you're back.

779
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,120
Mom.

780
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,560
Quick, sit down.

781
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,320
Mom.

782
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
You asked me to come home.

783
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,800
Is everything okay?

784
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,220
[Household Register]

785
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,200
Marry her.

786
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,240
My son.

787
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,560
A while ago,

788
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,960
I did

789
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,120
things that upset you.

790
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,200
I hope you can forgive me.

791
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,720
I just want the best for you.

792
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,120
Thanks, mom.

793
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,520
Since you're going to be a father,

794
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
you must become

795
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
a dependable

796
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,640
and responsible husband.

797
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
You can no longer behave

798
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,320
childishly.

799
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,120
Understood?

800
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,200
Mom.

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,080
Actually, we...

802
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
Your father left too soon.

803
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
I worked hard to support our family

804
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,360
and neglected you since you were small.

805
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,840
But

806
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,560
you must not do the same

807
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,000
to your child.

808
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,120
You must give

809
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,600
the child a complete family.

810
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
Kids with a single parent would have

811
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,960
difficult lives.

812
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,320
Mom.

813
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,240
Don't worry.

814
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,560
I know that Dad passed away too soon and

815
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,360
it was hard for you to be a single parent.

816
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,760
After Qin Qing and I get married,

817
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,440
I'll take better care of you.

818
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,600
If you mean what you say, the two of you

819
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,160
should bring my grandchild

820
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,360
home to keep me

821
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,680
company.

822
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,880
If you're too busy with work,

823
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,360
I can put

824
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,960
my work at school aside

825
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,200
to look after your child.

826
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,600
Miss Fang,

827
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,080
most orders for the haute couture collection

828
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,480
have been canceled.

829
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,320
the sales of our ready-made clothing managed to

830
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,320
increase by 30%

831
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,580
last month.

832
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,160
I wonder

833
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,080
it'll be affected as well.

834
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,840
Why don't I

835
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,760
talk to our clients?

836
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,080
Then we might

837
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,280
be able to save these orders.

838
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,640
Miss Fang.

839
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,040
If they don't trust the

840
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,760
online platform,

841
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,760
we can send people

842
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
to retake their measurements,

843
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,160
even if they are in different cities.

844
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,480
If we can find tailors to work with us,

845
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,240
we can make it

846
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,760
happen.

847
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,520
At least we can keep the orders

848
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,120
not suffer losses,

849
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
and we don't affect the reputation of TKY

850
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
ready-made clothing brand.

851
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,600
If we do that now, it'll mean that

852
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,840
we ourselves

853
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,520
deny the

854
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,800
applicability of online tailoring service.

855
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,440
Actually, its applicability

856
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
doesn't affect us

857
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,080
much,

858
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,800
as long as we offer offline

859
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,480
services.

860
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,040
But we must be aware of the fact

861
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,600
that these orders were

862
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,760
brought to us by the

863
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,960
online tailoring platform.

864
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,800
Or else, given the

865
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,680
popularity and

866
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,600
influence of our brand,

867
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,440
we wouldn't be able

868
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,520
to boost sales instantly.

869
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,800
We can't make things worse

870
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,960
for the platform

871
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,920
just because it's taken offline.

872
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,440
We should insist on doing

873
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,640
what we're supposed to do.

874
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,120
So you still plan to complete

00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,080
these canceled

orders

877
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,840
and give them to customers for free?

878
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes.

879
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,120
We will show them

880
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,840
our sincerity

881
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,840
and make them recognize the accuracy,

882
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,560
efficiency and convenience of  the online

883

of the online tailoring service

887
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,960
has already been improved.

888
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,920
We must make sure that the customers

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,640
get to enjoy

890
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,360
its convenience.

And we'll provide better service in the future.

So I'm sorry.

893

I have to act on my judgment today.

894
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,320
No worries, Miss Fang.

895
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,840
I support all your decisions.

I'll support you too.

Sweetheart,

901
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,000
I've promised you that

902
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,560
I would resolve the conflict

903

between you and my mom,

Although lying to my mom

906
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
is not the best approach,

907
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
but I know my mom.

Don't worry too much about it.

I'm the one lying to my mom.

915
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,720
I'll find a chance to

916

explain it to her properly and

how far I can go on my own.

you never gave up.

Besides,

President Su has treated me well.

when the company is

973

facing difficulties, right?

974
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,080
You don't have to decide now.

Okay. See you in the evening.

980
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,600
Coming.

981
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:00,840
Hey.

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,880
Let's answer the door.

983
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm coming.

Ms Tian.

985
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
Why are you holding it?

986
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
There must be so many bacteria on it.

987
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,160
It's filthy.

988
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,680
You're pregnant now.

989
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,720
You shouldn't

990
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,560
touch animals

991
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,240
such as cats and dogs.

992
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,520
Have you heard of parasitic worms?

993
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,640
If a pregnant woman gets infected,

994
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,120
the baby will be deformed.

995
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,880
Understood?

996
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
I think it's alright.

997
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,840
I always bathe her.

998
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,320
Besides, she gets vaccines every year.

999
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,120
That doesn't work. It's full of bacteria.

1000
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,320
It's still filthy.

1001
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,640
Listen to me.

1002
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,280
Just give it away

1003
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,440
okay?

1004
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,680
By the way,

1005
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,320
Do you have cilantro at home?

1006
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,680
I forgot to buy one on my way here.

1007
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,440
I don't eat cilantro very often.

1008
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,000
How could you be such a picky eater?

1009
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,640
You can't be picky during this time.

1010
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,000
You have to eat everything.

1011
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,720
A balanced diet is important, understood?

1012
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,400
I...

1013
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,720
Don't enter the kitchen.

1014
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,320
You're pregnant now.

1015
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,480
You can't come in.

1016
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,800
There will be smoke all over.

1017
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,200
It's not good for the baby.

1018
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,679
Today

1019
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,040
I'm making you pork rib soup.

1020
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,040
It's rich in Calcium.

1021
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,280
Ms Tian.

1022
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,520
I have something to tell you.

1023
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,400
We can talk later.

1024
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,679
Don't come in.

1025
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,480
I'm going to make soup.

1026
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,199
From your look,

1027
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,800
you failed to persuade her, right?

1028
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,320
You can say that.

1029
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,000
Zhou Fang refused to leave.

1030
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,639
She said she couldn't leave now.

1031
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,520
I respect her decision. I'll let her be.

1032
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,760
Now I can understand

1033
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
Zhou Fang is so special

1034
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,440
in your eyes.

1035
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,000
Special?

1036
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,360
Compared with women of her age,

1037
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
she's more independent

1038
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,040
and straightforward.

1039
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,560
She has her thoughts.

1040
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,280
And you

1041
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,320
know how to cherish and protect her.

1042
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,000
You give her space.

1043
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,200
This is perhaps

1044
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,160
why you're perfect for each other.

1045
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,160
Zhou Fang asked me...

1046
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
why I cannot cooperate

1047
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
and coexist with Su Yu Shan.

1048
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,240
What do you think?

1049
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,600
If we aim to achieve a win-win situation

1050
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,560
at a time like this,

1051
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,360
we'll be able to help Wan Feng

1052
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,600
with its urgently needs.

1053
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,160
But Su Yu Shan might not

1054
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,240
accept our help.

1055
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
If we can't get

1056
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,560
an agreement from both sides,

1057
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,280
one of us will suffer

1058
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,200
huge losses.

1059
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,640
When I was doing

1060
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,160
project evaluation for Wan Feng,

1061
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
I had warned him

1062
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,440
that his application had quite a lot

1063
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,520
of security flaws.

1064
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,680
But he was eager to get the app up and running.

1065
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
He refused to listen.

1066
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,240
What happened to his company

1067
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,560
is not entirely unexpected.

1068
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,280
If we come up with

1069
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
a marketing plan

1070
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
and seize the chance

1071
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,200
to promote our platform,

1072
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,680
we'll dominate the market.

1073
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
But if you decide

1074
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
to help Su Yu Shan,

1075
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,480
I'll support you too.

1076
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
We can then expand the

1077
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,840
haute couture market.

1078
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,600
I don't wish

1079
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,560
to see my old company

1080
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,920
to fret over this matter.

1081
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
Do you think

1082
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,400
Su Yu Shan will agree with it?

1083
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,920
I don't know him well.

1084
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,720
But I think

1085
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,360
we can give it a try.

1086
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,240
You're back.

1087
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,040
If you're sleepy, go back to sleep.

1088
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,000
I feel as if

1089
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,560
I hadn't seen you for a long time.

1090
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,240
I'm not sleeping.

1091
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,720
I'll get up.

1092
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,800
Sweetheart,

1093
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,640
you married me

1094
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,880
without a diamond ring.

1095
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,480
I have to look at jewelry every day

1096
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,280
at work.

1097
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm fine without a ring.

1098
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,320
No way.

1099
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,440
A married woman must own a diamond

1100
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,520
wedding ring.

1101
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,960
Tell you what.

1102
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,640
You go to pick a diamond tomorrow.

1103
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,520
I'll pay for it.

1104
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,080
Don't try to save money for me.

1105
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
I'm now President Zuo, after all.

1106
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,080
Okay then.

1107
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,880
Thank you, hubby.

1108
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,760
Miss Qing, your water.

1109
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,080
These diamonds

1110
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,000
newly arrived.

1111
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,280
Each of their clarity is perfect.

1112
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,880
I don't normally show them to other customers.

1113
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,960
They are great indeed.

1114
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,560
But this time,

1115
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
I'm looking for one for myself.

1116
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,160
These are too good.

1117
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
You're getting married?

1118
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,800
Congratulations.

1119
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
Hey, wait. If you're picking one for yourself,

1120
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,560
shouldn't you pick the best one?

1121
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,240
I... It's unnecessary for me to have the best diamond.

1122
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Never need one.

1123
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't care about it if I wear it every day.

1124
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,120
Come on.

1125
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
This is so uncharacteristic of you.

1126
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,120
Don't ask.

1127
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,200
Pick a few that are

1128
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,800
about 10,000 yuan

1129
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,520
for me.

1130
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,360
Okay.

1131
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,120
But this one has a nice color.

1132
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,960
Indeed.

1133
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,560
Miss Qing.

1134
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,920
Are you trying

1135
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,000
to save money for your boyfriend?

1136
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,200
Is it obvious?

1137
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,800
A little.

1138
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,800
He just started working a while ago.

1139
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,360
It's not easy for him to earn money.

1140
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't want him to spend too much.

1141
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,720
Miss Qing, you used to be quite frivolous

1142
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,920
with your spending.

1143
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,120
I didn't expect that

1144
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,040
when you get married,

1145
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,560
you become so much more thoughtful.

1146
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,840
Was I

1147
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,880
frivolous with my spending?

1148
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Looks like you've found your true love this time.

1149
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,600
Miss Qing,

1150
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,920
I think when it comes to a wedding ring,

1151
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,320
you shouldn't settle for less.

1152
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,760
But if you really like

1153
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,600
this one.

1154
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,000
I have an idea.

1155
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
What idea?

1156
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,080
Since you have lots of money,

1157
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,440
you can pay for a fraction of the cost.

1158
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,400
I'll issue you

1159
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
a 10,000 yuan receipt.

1160
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
That way,

1161
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,680
you can take this diamond ring

1162
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,040
without hurting his pride.

1163
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,200
I'm just suggesting.

1164
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,240
Don't be upset.

1165
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,680
Why didn't I think of it?

1166
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,480
You're so smart.

1167
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,720
Let's do this then.

1168
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,320
Well,

1169
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
what are you waiting for?

1170
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,880
Don't just sit here. Process my purchase now.

1171
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,040
I want this one.

1172
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,640
Off work?

1173
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,640
Not yet. I'm taking a break.

1174
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,200
I call you because I miss you.

1175
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,000
What a good boy, Wu San.

1176
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,920
Sorry, Sweetheart.

1177
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,600
I haven't got the time today

1178
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,640
to select the diamond ring with you.

1179
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,800
Have you picked one?

1180
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm waiting to make the payment.

1181
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,520
I've picked one.

1182
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,280
I'll show you later.

1183
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
How much is it? I'll wire you the money.

1184
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,120
Your card is

1185
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,080
with me.

1186
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,600
You don't need to wire me money.

1187
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
You give me much pocket money

1188
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,480
every month.

1189
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,600
I can't spend them all.

1190
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,000
You can wire me

1191
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,280
12,000 yuan.

1192
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Is it that cheap?

1193
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,840
I can get a discount.

1194
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,760
I can get the

1195
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,080
the best deal.

1196
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,040
You're not lying to me, right?

1197
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,640
Don't worry.

1198
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,360
I won't settle for less.

1199
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,560
I'll pick

1200
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,440
my favorite diamond.

1201
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,760
If you like it, I would like it too.

1202
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
Wan Feng Group got sued.

1203
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,680
They are in quite a lot of trouble.

1204
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,680
You heard about it?

1205
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,680
My dad said that

1206
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,360
many competitors had been envious of

1207
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,440
Su Yu Shan for years.

1208
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Now that the company is in trouble

1209
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,840
and their stocks plummet,

1210
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,880
their projects

1211
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,800
are in jeopardize too.

1212
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,600
It's a messy situation.

1213
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,240
You have to be cautious.

1214
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,360
Don't get dragged into this.

1215
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,240
