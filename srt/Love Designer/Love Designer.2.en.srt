President Song.

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Good day, President Song.

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,480
President Song.

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Is everyone here?

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's start.

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,880
Our biggest competitor,

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,560
Bai Sai Group,

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,600
announced

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,160
its latest clothing line,

36
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,000
and its sales

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,800
have overtaken us.

38
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,680
Do we have to realign

39
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,120
our marketing strategy

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,960
of Si Yue's brand?

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,200
What do you think?

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,240
We have discussed it.

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,280
We should

44
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,160
reduce our price and

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,640
increase production

46
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,240
to gain the market.

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
I hold

48
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
a different opinion.

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
Our branding strategy for women's clothing

50
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,440
is affordable luxury.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,760
Right?

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,440
Every girl

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,360
doesn't hope that

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
her dress is the same as others.

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Now,

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
if we

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
reduce the price and

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,880
increase production,

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,840
our brand

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,360
will end up being

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,640
a common

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,240
and low-class brand.

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
We have to do something different

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
for this.

65
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,320
Hello.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,080
Is President Wang here?

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
He's dead.

68
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Dead...Dead?

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,560
If there's anything,

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
just let me know.

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm the boss here.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,600
Okay.

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,080
I'm the landlord of this building.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,960
The rental for this quarter

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,800
is due.

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
No info is received yet

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
for the rental of next quarter.

78
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,640
I couldn't reach President Wang.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,400
So,

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm here to check.

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,920
Alright, I got it.

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,560
I'll pay for it soon.

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,760
If nothing else,

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll leave now.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Okay.

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,240
This is the new product

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,320
of Si Yue's brand.

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Yes.

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
It's counterfeit.

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,280
Is it in the market now?

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,200
Not yet.

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,200
It's still in production.

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
But I couldn't find out

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
the background of the company.

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
I don't have any resources

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,560
in this matter.

98
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
Let me do it.

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,360
Great.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,960
Every apparel

101
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,200
of our brand

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
has been

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,280
trademarked.

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
As long as we can find the source of counterfeit,

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,960
we'll have the right

106
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
to request the party

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,560
to take down the product

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
and compensate for our loss.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,400
Yes.

110
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,040
Last time,

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,400
we've met

112
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,440
the supplier from Egypt.

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Because of news leakage,

114
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,520
some problems occurred.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,880
I thought that

116
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,800
it's an accident.

117
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,320
Now, thinking back,

118
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,680
there's a spy

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
among our company top management.

120
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,080
If so,

121
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,240
not only

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,560
the brand of Si Yue

123
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
that has leaked.

124
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,880
President Song.

125
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,520
Do you think that

126
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,560
I should send someone

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
to check it out

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,720
at the underground factory?

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,000
Of course.

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,360
We have so many garment factories

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
in the country.

132
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
It's a tedious job

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
to check one by one.

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,280
We have signed many

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,120
fashion designers

136
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,840
who have own original brands.

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,880
So, we

138
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
have the responsibility

139
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,040
to take care of their designs.

140
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,400
It

141
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,480
must be done

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,680
no matter how tedious it is.

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Miss Fang.

144
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,400
The company has paid you all, right?

145
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,760
No. No.

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,680
We're not leaving.

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes, we're not leaving.

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,840
We decided to stay.

149
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm Shao Kai.

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,640
I take charge of

151
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
the IT database.

152
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,240
I can solve the problems of

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,160
computers

154
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,520
and network of this company.

155
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm Tang Jie.

156
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm a fashion designer.

157
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,040
Although I've never made anything

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
since I graduated,

159
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,320
I'll work harder.

160
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,200
I'm You You.

161
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm still an intern.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Now,

163
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,160
I know nothing,

164
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,000
but I'm a fast learner.

165
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Yes.

166
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,440
Are you all willing to stay with me?

167
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,720
Yes.

168
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,720
Let's work hard together in future.

169
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,240
I surely

170
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,280
won't disappoint you all.

171
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
I...Let me get ready.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,400
I...

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,080
I...

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,160
My friend got me

175
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
the best lawyer in the country.

176
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm going to the law firm today.

177
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
I...We...

178
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
must get back what we deserve.

179
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,200
President Song.

180
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
We've checked

181
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,840
the factory that counterfeits Si Yue's brand.

182
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,760
The salary given is low.

183
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,720
It gets

184
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,440
whatever order.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,720
However, most of them

186
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,160
are counterfeits.

187
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,920
Probably because of that,

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
their security system is good,

189
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
we couldn't enter.

190
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,760
Of course, you couldn't enter

191
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
directly in this way.

192
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,280
Unless you're their worker.

193
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,520
Do you mean that...

194
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
we should

195
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
enter it as

196
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,160
a worker?

197
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,160
I got it.

198
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,480
You're better

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
at this.

200
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
Get someone new in the company.

201
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,520
Someone smarter.

202
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,800
Okay, I got it.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,720
Do it now.

204
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,480
Sorry. Sorry.

205
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,840
Are you new?

206
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,640
Do you work out often?

207
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,640
Work out?

208
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,320
Quite fit.

209
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,640
You'll get a mission later.

210
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,160
What mission?

211
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,120
An important mission.

212
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Shen.

213
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,040
How?

214
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Wang Ze Yang is your fiancée?

215
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,760
Not married yet.

216
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,040
About to get married officially.

217
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,840
How long have you been together?

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,800
For about five to six years.

219
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,200
What's wrong?

220
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,320
Three years ago, Wang Ze Yang

221
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
was a shareholder of your company.

222
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,720
You're the legal person.

223
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
The investor was your father.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
Within these three years,

225
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,280
your turnover rate has been increasing,

226
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,000
but there's a huge amount of money

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
flowing out through investment.

228
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,680
The contract was signed by you

229
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,920
as the legal person.

230
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
Moreover, everything is done

231
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
according to the legal procedure.

232
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,760
In simple words,

233
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,520
Zhou Fang can't charge him.

234
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,120
You may criticize him

235
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,040
from the aspect of moral,

236
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,080
but whatever he has done

237
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,080
was legal.

238
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
You've no solution as well?

239
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,800
It's not optimistic.

240
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,720
It has been

241
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,680
in this point,

242
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
it can't be

243
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,320
unplanned.

244
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,480
Luckily,

245
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,240
when you bought the house,

246
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,640
you didn't write

247
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,480
Wang Ze Yang's name on the list.

248
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,440
Or else,

249
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
you might have lost it as well.

250
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,280
Many people advised you at that time.

251
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
It was paid

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,800
by your family.

253
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
Yet, you chose to put his name.

254
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,040
I don't understand

255
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
why you loved him so much?

256
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm not talking about it.

257
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
I get annoyed talking about it.

258
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
I couldn't think of the reason...

259
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,600
Why didn't I

260
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,680
realize it that time?

261
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
He cheated you purposely.

262
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
You weren't vigilant.

263
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
Moreover, you trusted him.

264
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,880
It's natural you can't realize it.

265
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,560
But he was good to me.

266
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,480
If he did it for only one year.

267
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
but over five years.

268
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,880
How can someone

269
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
act for more than five years?

270
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
Forget about five years.

271
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
If not because of the mistress,

272
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
it's possible to be more than 50 years.

273
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm telling you.

274
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,320
Look at what he has done,

275
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,320
that mistress is surely

276
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
richer than you.

277
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,880
Do you believe me?

278
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,200
Well done.

279
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,560
It's fine.

280
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
Stop lecturing her.

281
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,040
It's happened.

282
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
We learn the lesson.

283
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
In such a case,

284
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,600
I suggest

285
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,040
a thorough company system check-up

286
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,000
to identify

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,800
any possible flaw

288
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,880
to avoid trouble in future.

289
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
Alright. I got it.

290
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,200
I'll check it out.

291
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,340
[Memory Brand Introduction]

292
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,000
That's serious.

293
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,920
Only two items?

294
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,240
President Song.

295
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,000
It's really not bad

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,960
to get back two items.

297
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,280
Luckily, we have

298
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,880
Zuo Yu Lin.

299
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,160
You've no idea.

300
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
At the moment we entered,

301
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,280
we had been caught.

302
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,440
Five fit guys

303
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,400
were chasing us.

304
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,160
Luckily, I was smart.

305
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,920
I found a way.

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I asked Zuo Yu Lin to leave first.

307
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
Actually,

308
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
Zuo Yu Lin's fit.

309
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,440
He could run fast.

310
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,280
When he was caught,

311
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
he told nothing.

312
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,880
So smart.

313
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
You're new here?

314
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,880
What's your name?

315
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,840
Zuo Yu Lin.

316
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,760
Thank you.

317
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
Go to a hospital for a check-up.

318
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,000
Our company will pay for it.

319
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,240
Get well soon.

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Return to work after that.

321
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,400
Thank you, President Song.

322
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,400
President Chen, I...

323
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,160
President Song.

324
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,920
You must

325
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,440
revenge for us.

326
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
You must sue them

327
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,240
until they file a bankruptcy.

328
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,120
You did it poorly.

329
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,800
You don't have to worry.

330
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,560
Then, may I

331
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,640
go to the hospital

332
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,320
and take leaves?

333
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,080
You may rest after getting this settled.

334
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,200
Get changed.

335
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,040
Follow me.

336
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,840
Since it's happened,

337
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,320
let's figure out

338
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
a solution.

339
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,400
Hungry?

340
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm fine.

341
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,160
Steamboat?

342
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:18,960
Alright.

343
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,120
It's here.

344
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
Cover yourself.

345
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,360
It's too serious.

346
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,920
Please try

347
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,680
my instant coffee.

348
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,200
You

349
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
need to handle such a small case?

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,720
What do you mean?

351
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Your business is growing.

352
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,360
So you don't accept small cases?

353
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,000
I didn't mean it.

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,640
However.

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,440
Have a look of it.

356
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,660
[Memory Brand Information, Legal person: Zhou Fang]

357
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,200
Zhou Fang?

358
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,760
Zhou Fang.

359
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,880
Let me explain.

360
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,680
It's not

361
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,480
what you're thinking.

362
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,560
Go back with me.

363
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,400
Okay?

364
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,400
How many five years

365
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,600
can a woman have?

366
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,120
I've given everything to him.

367
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
You know her?

368
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,560
I don't know.

369
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,840
This lady

370
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,880
has been cheated by her fiancé.

371
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
I can't tell more.

372
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
Or else, it'll affect your judgement.

373
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,800
You're being odd.

374
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,720
Do you think you were in a relationship

375
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
or doing charity?

376
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,360
You gave him a house

377
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,560
and started up a company for him.

378
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,600
The money was spent like water.

379
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,640
You said that he was naïve

380
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
and the best man in the world.

381
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,880
Thousand years...

382
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,960
Alright. Alright.

383
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,160
Stop that.

384
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
You never shut up

385
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,440
since you got into the car.

386
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,640
Bla bla bla.

387
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,840
You sound like my mum.

388
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,760
I know that I'm wrong.

389
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,480
So?

390
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,440
It's happened.

391
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,580
[Mum]

392
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Speak of the devil.

393
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,280
Second round.

394
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,599
Mum.

395
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,560
I...

396
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm with Qin Qing.

397
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,119
We're not going to eat at home.

398
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,960
We're ready to...

399
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,520
No way!

400
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
You must come back!

401
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,000
Or else, don't come back again.

402
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,359
Alright!

403
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
You must return home for dinner.

404
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,000
Alright, sure.

405
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,160
I'll wait for you all.

406
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,560
Okay.

407
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Okay.

408
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,760
Let's go.

409
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880
Do you think that I should say it out?

410
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,320
Yes.

411
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,520
You need to say it out sooner or later.

412
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,640
One has heart illness.

413
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,360
Another has high blood pressure.

414
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,200
How should I say it out?

415
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,360
How if

416
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
you tell them tactfully?

417
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,640
Tactfully?

418
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,720
I'm not someone

419
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
whom you just know.

420
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
Am I able to

421
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,560
speak tactfully?

422
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,760
You're right.

423
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,200
That's how a person of low EQ looks like.

424
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,320
Why did you make an ad hominem attack?

425
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm serious.

426
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,120
How about you say it out?

427
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,040
I say it out?

428
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,200
How am I supposed to say it out?

429
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,960
Keep your voice down.

430
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,560
How should I say it out?

431
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,640
If I tell them,

432
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,720
they will ask you as well.

433
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,200
You can say it tactfully.

434
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,720
I won't say it. You do it yourself.

435
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,320
You don't even want to help me.

436
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,800
Come in.

437
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,280
Let's eat.

438
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,600
You say it out.

439
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:52,880
You say it out.

440
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,880
You say it out.

441
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,600
You say it out.

442
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,440
Both of you eat more.

443
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,880
Thank you, uncle.

444
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,160
Come on, Qing.

445
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Eat this.

446
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,000
Thank you, aunt.

447
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,320
How was the

448
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,600
wedding photo session?

449
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,080
It's fine.

450
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,880
Oh, yes.

451
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,960
Why didn't Wang

452
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,800
come with you two

453
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,360
to eat here

454
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,320
after photo shooting?

455
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,520
Let me make a phone call.

456
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,360
Mum.

457
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,440
Don't call. Don't call.

458
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,400
He's busy now.

459
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,040
He can't pick up your call.

460
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,000
He's busy now.

461
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,600
What's so busy about?

462
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,320
Mum.

463
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,400
Please eat.

464
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,360
What's wrong?

465
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,440
Nothing.

466
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,840
Nothing. She stepped on my foot.

467
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,360
Are you hiding

468
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,000
something from me?

469
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,080
No. Nothing.

470
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,480
It's a little thing.

471
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,320
Tell me. What's that?

472
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,320
Dad.

473
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Have you taken antihypertensive?

474
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,040
It's fine. I'm alright.

475
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,440
Mum.

476
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
About what I'm going to tell you,

477
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,480
don't get angry.

478
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,520
You quickly tell me.

479
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,520
This...

480
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,440
Say it.

481
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,960
Qing.

482
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
You tell me.

483
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,640
I...

484
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,680
How am I supposed to say it out?

485
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,760
You quickly say it out.

486
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,960
I've broken up with Wang Ze Yang.

487
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,840
He ran away with money.

488
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,840
Why did you say that?

489
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
Is not?

490
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,120
Of course not.

491
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,240
Ru Hui.

492
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
Mum!

493
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,320
Aunt!

494
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,040
Keep calm.

495
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,680
Hurry up, Fang!

496
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,560
Bring over medicine!

497
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,360
Get her a glass of water.

498
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,880
Here it is, aunt.

499
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,560
Drink some water.

500
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,080
Mum!

501
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,840
Come.

502
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
Give me medicine.

503
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,360
I can't open it.

504
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,720
Mum.

505
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Don't frighten me, mum.

506
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,600
Mum.

507
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,600
We've made a police report, mum.

508
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,520
The police said that

509
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,920
they can

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
get back the money for us.

511
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Mum.

512
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,040
Yes, aunt.

513
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,880
Money can be earned.

514
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,600
A new boyfriend

515
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,400
can be found.

516
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,960
Right?

517
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,200
Verified.

518
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
Please open the door.

519
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Welcome back, President Song.

520
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,080
Aunt.

521
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Does she like the present?

522
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,840
She doesn't like it.

523
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,880
She asked you to

524
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,760
get her something like

525
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
hip hip...

526
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,280
or hop-hop style.

527
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,160
That's called

528
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,160
hip-hop style.

529
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,320
Yes.

530
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,920
Recently, Luo Luo

531
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,080
is quite down.

532
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,600
Every day, she locks herself in her bedroom

533
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,480
without eating

534
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,680
after returning home.

535
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,080
Then, she turns on the music

536
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
as loud as possible.

537
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,720
Such loud music

538
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,560
doesn't make me

539
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,600
feel comfortable.

540
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,720
It's fine. Let me talk to her.

541
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,200
Aunt.

542
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,560
Your heart seems weak.

543
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Let me arrange

544
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,360
a health check-up for you.

545
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,840
It's fine.

546
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
It's just the noise.

547
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,640
It's alright.

548
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,760
It's good to attend a check-up.

549
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,240
Thank you, President Song.

550
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm going to continue my work.

551
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,600
Okay.

552
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
Keep your voice down, Luo Luo.

553
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
Keep your voice down, Luo Luo!

554
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,240
Can you care about

555
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
others' feeling?

556
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,520
Song Luo!

557
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,840
Song Luo.

558
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,800
Did you

559
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
make trouble at school again?

560
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,240
If you want me to

561
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,960
solve it for you tomorrow,

562
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
turn off the music now!

563
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
Seriously.

564
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,480
It's not this one either.

565
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,320
Check if this contract

566
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,080
is still valid.

567
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,960
Yes.

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,480
This order was signed not long ago.

569
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
It's written that

570
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,880
delivery will be made in ten days.

571
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,240
Hurry and ask the factory

572
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,200
about the current progress.

573
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Let me make a call.

574
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,240
0170.

575
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
Manager Wang!

576
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
Hello! This is Zhou Fang.

577
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,480
Okay.

578
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,440
I have an order here.

579
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
I'm calling

580
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,440
to do a follow-up with you.

581
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,600
The order number is

582
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,000
017001.

583
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,360
Is it being produced?

584
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,400
Okay.

585
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
Okay. I got it.

586
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,600
Alright.

587
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,960
Sure, no problem.

588
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,200
It's good as long as it can be delivered on time.

589
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
Okay! It's fine.

590
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,480
Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

591
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,040
There is always a way out

592
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,160
It can be delivered on time.

593
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
Unexpectedly, Wang Ze Yang

594
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,000
has forgotten about it.

595
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,960
You wished to have

596
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,680
your own brand before.

597
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,960
The chance is here

598
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
for you now.

599
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,720
I must think about

600
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,240
what else to do in future.

601
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,920
In the past,

602
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,240
I trusted Wang Ze Yang too much.

603
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,360
It caused me

604
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,280
troubles.

605
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,640
Don't talk about him anymore.

606
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,800
Tang Jie.

607
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,080
The flower looks nice!

608
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,720
Of course. I'm the one who chose it.

609
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm a designer.

610
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,960
Of course, I have good taste.

611
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,600
Yes.

612
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,680
Look at the

613
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,960
second-hand couch bought by Miss Fang.

614
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
It looks not bad too.

615
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,520
Yes, it looks good at there.

616
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,640
Alright, everybody.

617
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,440
You all are so energetic.

618
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,520
Let's call a meeting.

619
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,520
Okay.

620
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,120
Okay.

621
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,600
Come. Sit here.

622
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,400
Thank you.

623
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,080
Any new instruction?

624
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,960
I've thought of it.

625
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I think that we need to

626
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
have a new plan for our future.

627
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,520
First of all,

628
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,360
from the original design

629
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,080
of apparel...

630
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,600
Hello.

631
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,280
Hello.

632
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Is Zhou Fang here?

633
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,320
I am here.

634
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,360
Here's your parcel.

635
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,280
Please sign for it.

636
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,720
Okay.

637
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
Is it a new order?

638
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,320
Open it now, Miss Fang.

639
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,520
Okay. What?

640
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Order?

641
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,800
I'm so nervous now.

642
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,840
Legal letter.

643
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,060
[Legal Letter]

644
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,360
Lawyer Shen.

645
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm really sorry.

646
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,440
I have no say in this matter.

647
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,160
Yes.

648
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,000
Because I'm an attorney of my client.

649
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,560
Keep calm.

650
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,040
There's no official result

651
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,200
for this matter yet.

652
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,680
Please don't.

653
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,040
It's against the principle.

654
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,320
It's fine. I have something else to do.

655
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,960
Zhou Fang again?

656
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,480
How do you know?

657
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,560
It's not easy to find

658
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,320
a rascal like her?

659
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,840
President Song.

660
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,040
Basically,

661
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,080
I'm familiar with

662
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,840
your social circle.

663
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,360
When did you

664
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,240
know Zhou Fang?

665
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,840
Who says that I know her?

666
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,840
Is that your business?

667
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,520
Regarding her matter,

668
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,480
proceed with legal procedure.

669
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,120
Got it.

670
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,520
I'm here.

671
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,360
Hello, Lawyer Shen.

672
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,320
We meet again.

673
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,560
Have a seat.

674
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,880
I'm sorry.

675
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
I've been appointed as well.

676
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,840
He's my regular client.

677
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,960
I couldn't reject him.

678
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,000
Sorry.

679
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,240
Lawyer Shen.

680
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,080
I understand.

681
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,200
You're doing your job.

682
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,360
Even if you don't

683
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,000
issue the legal letter,

684
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,400
he'll get someone else to do it.

685
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,040
That's great.

686
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,960
Because

687
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,320
we are long-term working partners.

688
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,280
So...

689
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,080
Shen.

690
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,400
Stop saying too much bullshit.

691
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,840
Since we are old friends,

692
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,080
can't you even

693
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,840
help us?

694
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,320
I don't mean not to help.

695
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,040
Lawyer Shen.

696
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,640
I have a request.

697
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Can you arrange a meeting

698
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,920
for me and Song Lin?

699
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,120
I'll need to

700
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,080
get his permission first.

701
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
Lawyer Shen.

702
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,000
Please.

703
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,360
Please.

704
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,680
Alright.

705
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,760
Yes.

706
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
I've sent you

707
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,720
the show plan.

708
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,440
To your e-mail.

709
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,000
Take a look.

710
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,240
Here?

711
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,600
Yes.

712
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,200
Here is the new tank?

713
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
What an excellent workmanship!

714
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,140
[Lawyer Shen]

715
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,200
Hello.

716
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,360
President Song.

717
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,520
The defendant of the copyright court case,

718
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,120
Zhou Fang,

719
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,440
would like to meet you

720
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to have a discussion.

721
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,360
A discussion?

722
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,440
Let me think about it.

723
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,320
Okay.

724
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,320
Talk to him now.

725
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,680
Hello, hello!

726
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
Don't hang up, please.

727
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,240
I'm the one who wore a bridesmaid dress.

728
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,560
I didn't leave my contact.

729
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Unexpectedly.

730
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,520
What a coincidence.

731
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
I'm the legal representative

732
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,080
of the company.

733
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:17,960
I...

734
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,000
Surprise?

735
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,440
Let me consider. I'm going to hang up.

736
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,400
Wait!

737
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,280
He hung up?

738
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,040
Who's that? What a sweet voice.

739
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,000
Nobody.

740
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,640
Is she pretty?

741
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,880
I have no idea.

742
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,240
Look at yourself.

743
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,520
Don't just be a single.

744
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,480
Do you want to be a rich single

745
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
forever?

746
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,320
You have a girlfriend?

747
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,560
Show me.

748
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm different from you.

749
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,680
I'm loyal.

750
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
I have someone I love.

751
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,200
Mind your own business.

752
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Get away. You almost damage it.

753
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,920
Go away.

754
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,520
Let's work!

755
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,840
Hello, my friend.

756
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,640
We meet again.

757
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,120
President Song.

758
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Do you want to hit me?

759
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
No, no, no.

760
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,280
How is that possible?

761
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,360
Where did you get the address?

762
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,760
Lawyer Shen told you?

763
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,160
Who doesn't know

764
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
your company address?

765
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,640
President Song

766
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,600
is also a public figure.

767
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,360
Tell me.

768
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,240
Where did you get the design draft?

769
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,920
I got it from my ex-boyfriend.

770
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
I have no idea

771
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
of how it was obtained.

772
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,120
However,

773
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,040
there must be misunderstandings.

774
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,040
Misunderstanding again?

775
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Why do you meet me now?

776
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,200
I couldn't find him.

777
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,160
Before he left,

778
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,920
he's settled everything

779
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,560
between him

780
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,600
and the company.

781
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,920
So legally speaking,

782
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
this case

783
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,200
would be charged

784
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
on me.

785
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,120
So?

786
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,200
So,

787
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,200
I'm not sure if

788
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,240
it's right to tell you this.

789
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,280
Now, I'm really having

790
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,040
some troubles.

791
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
Because

792
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,600
something has happened.

793
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,680
I'm having cash flow issues.

794
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,680
Can you

795
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,360
give me a chance?

796
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,040
Regarding...

797
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,360
President Song, here is the thing.

798
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,960
Since your corporate is so well-known,

799
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,000
you don't have to

800
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,960
make it hard on us.

801
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,640
Right?

802
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,760
Can you

803
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
withdraw the prosecution?

804
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,080
Can we settle it privately?

805
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:10,920
No way.

806
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,560
You all should be aware of

807
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,240
the design industry in China.

808
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,560
Originality of design

809
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,720
must be preserved.

810
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,600
I couldn't care for others,

811
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,600
but I have to protect

812
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,680
my own designers.

813
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,800
You have two choices.

814
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,840
First, we proceed with legal action.

815
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
Second, tell me

816
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,080
how you got the draft?

817
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,840
I have no idea

818
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,080
of how to check it.

819
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,120
But regarding

820
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,760
the private settlement,

821
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,440
can we talk more about it?

822
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,800
It means that nothing we can talk.

823
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,040
I thought you all

824
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,840
are responsible for your action.

825
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,080
In fact, you're just giving excuses.

826
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,960
Anything else?

827
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,760
Yes.

828
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Zhou Fang isn't the one

829
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,800
who would evade problems.

830
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,480
It's different now.

831
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,600
She was just cheated

832
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,360
by her ex-boyfriend.

833
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,680
Your legal action

834
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,000
adds insult to injury.

835
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,960
She didn't plan to

836
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,800
beg you.

837
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,000
I asked her to come over.

838
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,159
Because I think

839
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,880
sympathy

840
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
should be given,

841
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,679
as both you

842
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,520
met each other before.

843
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,400
Both you are considered friends.

844
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,679
Please be tolerant.

845
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,080
Moreover,

846
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,400
Zhou Fang is working hard to be

847
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
a real fashion designer.

848
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,159
But these years,

849
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,880
she's been distracted

850
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,560
by something else.

851
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
She's also a victim.

852
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
What's the point

853
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,960
for telling me this?

854
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,040
I don't want anybody

855
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,760
to look down on her.

856
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,719
Let me tell you.

857
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
It's my own business

858
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,960
if I look down on her.

859
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,679
Respect is gained

860
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,719
by putting efforts,

861
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,560
not just by words.

862
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,159
Do you have to be cruel?

863
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,000
Do you really believe

864
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,160
what the man said, my dear?

865
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,200
You don't think too much.

866
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,440
Don't get angry.

867
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm quite angry.

868
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,240
I'm angry at myself.

869
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,960
How did I

870
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,920
get into this situation?

871
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,840
What's wrong?

872
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,680
When we

873
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
graduated,

874
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,280
we aimed to make our own brand.

875
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,920
Now,

876
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,440
because of my own mistakes,

877
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,880
I have to flatter others.

878
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm getting more compromising

879
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,600
and losing my dignity.

880
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,680
Just now,

881
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Song Lin

882
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
was right.

883
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,120
He's not the only one.

884
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,520
I also feel disappointed with myself.

885
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,080
Then, we can

886
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,040
restart.

887
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll support you.

888
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,440
You don't have to worry about money.

889
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
How was the young boy

890
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,240
that day?

891
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,200
He looked not bad.

892
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,000
You mean

893
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,080
Wu San?

894
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,720
That night,

895
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,520
after he sent me home,

896
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,080
he hasn't

897
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,920
contacted me again.

898
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
It's a tactic.

899
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,080
I won't fall into

900
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,240
his trap.

901
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,000
Let him go.

902
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,760
Come on.

903
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,120
Cheers.

904
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
What are you doing?

905
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,320
No.

906
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,000
I can't say that.

907
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,500
[Qin Qing]

908
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm Wu San.

909
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,720
Do you still remember me?

910
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:47,840
No.

911
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,560
How should I say?

912
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
She'll surely remember me.

913
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,280
The name of Wu San

914
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,480
was given by her.

915
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,040
Lecturers should have taught

916
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,160
about love in university.

917
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,160
Darn it.

918
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,160
I've sent it.

919
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,940
[Wu San]

920
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,920
What?

921
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,560
What's wrong?

922
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,120
Wu San

923
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,320
recalled it.

924
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,680
What is he doing?

925
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,440
He pretends that he mistakenly sent it.

926
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,320
So that I'd reply to him.

927
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,240
I'll be a fool if I do.

928
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,880
Zhi Zhou!

929
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,320
Wait for me there.

930
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,000
What's wrong?

931
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,080
How long have you known her?

932
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Does it matter?

933
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,640
Yes, it matters.

934
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,440
Love needs

935
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,680
time to reveal itself.

936
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,680
Five years.

937
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,640
My love towards you

938
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,880
has never changed.

939
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,440
Love and time

940
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,520
have no relationship.

941
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,320
Don't you understand?

942
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,800
We can only be friends.

943
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,040
Please don't leave!

944
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,120
I'm wrong.

945
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,360
I shouldn't talk to you about this.

946
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,240
Can I

947
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,400
keep being with you?

948
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
She'll be unhappy.

949
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,480
Sorry.

950
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,160
Cut!

951
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,920
Lu Na.

952
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,400
What a good act of crying.

953
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm amazed.

954
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,640
I'm flattered.

955
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,520
Take a break.

956
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,320
Another round later.

957
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,120
Tonight,

958
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,840
we have two more acts.

959
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,040
Please keep it up.

960
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,680
Director.

961
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,600
Excuse me.

962
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,480
For Lu Na,

963
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,520
it's stated in her contract that

964
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,760
she works for 8 hours a day.

965
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,040
She's been working overtime now.

966
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,760
We don't have much time.

967
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,880
We need to catch up.

968
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Time is running short.

969
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,200
Alright.

970
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,040
Lu Na.

971
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,720
Sure, get it arranged.

972
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Great!

973
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,640
Film crew!

974
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,440
To another scene!

975
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,920
Okay?

976
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,680
Hurry up!

977
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,200
Okay?

978
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,040
Hurry up!

979
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,760
Be quick!

980
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,040
Come on.

981
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,960
Please follow me, actors.

982
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Come on!

983
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,360
Hurry up!

984
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,840
We're leaving!

985
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,240
Did Song Lin call me?

986
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,680
No.

987
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
When will you

988
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,640
end your one-sided love?

989
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,880
It should end when he loves me.

990
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,320
It's been several years.

991
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,360
It's time to let it go.

992
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,840
Although I'm not

993
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,880
his lover,

994
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
I'm the closest to him.

995
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
He focuses on his career now.

996
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,600
One day, he's going to get married

997
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,200
or in love.

998
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,680
Right?

999
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,840
He

1000
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,040
will pick me one day.

1001
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,000
He's smart.

1002
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,200
Moreover, because of the matching,

1003
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
our relationship

1004
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
has become better,

1005
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,920
right?

1006
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,480
What if

1007
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,560
he

1008
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,280
meets someone he loves?

1009
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,000
What will you do?

1010
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,320
I won't allow

1011
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,480
it to happen.

1012
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,160
What's wrong with you?

1013
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,400
Get in the car.

1014
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,500
[Manager Wang]

1015
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,880
Manager Wang.

1016
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,080
Manager.

1017
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,160
Manager.

1018
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,880
Why was the production

1019
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
stopped?

1020
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,680
President Zhou.

1021
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,760
I've explained to you

1022
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,240
over the phone.

1023
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,320
We can't proceed

1024
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,880
your order.

1025
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,800
Why can't it be done?

1026
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,400
Give me a reason.

1027
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,960
In ten days,

1028
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,720
I have to deliver the goods.

1029
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,800
Yet, you stopped the production.

1030
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,200
Then, what should I do?

1031
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,280
I don't have the authority.

1032
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,440
It's our factory manager's decision.

1033
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,080
Where is he?

1034
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,640
I want to meet him.

1035
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,480
Please don't!

1036
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,400
You don't ask him either.

1037
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,320
Regarding

1038
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
the reason we stopped the production,

1039
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,200
you should have

1040
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
known it.

1041
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,640
Do you mean

1042
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,960
the court case of Wan Feng Group?

1043
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,040
Manager,

1044
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,480
the court case of Wan Feng Group

1045
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,760
has nothing to do with you.

1046
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,160
I have ten days

1047
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,880
to deliver the goods.

1048
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,800
But you

1049
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,720
halted the production.

1050
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,560
I can't deliver it.

1051
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,080
I'll have to compensate for my customer.

1052
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,160
You should know

1053
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,840
the amount of compensation.

1054
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,440
Of course, I know.

1055
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,920
But

1056
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,160
I don't have a say in this.

1057
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,520
Even our factory manager

1058
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,200
doesn't have

1059
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,520
a say in this matter either.

1060
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,240
Sorry.

1061
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,320
Wait.

1062
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,120
Anything else?

1063
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,640
How many pieces of fabric

1064
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,720
have been used up in production?

1065
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,440
About a quarter.

1066
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,960
Why?

1067
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,640
Since it's due to

1068
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,920
the copyright of the clothes,

1069
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,000
may I get back

1070
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,800
the remaining fabric?

1071
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,520
