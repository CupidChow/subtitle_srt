Why haven't you gone back yet?

236
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,840
I can cook that myself.

237
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,280
Why don't you go back and rest?

238
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,040
It's very late.

239
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,280
It's said that when someone frowns,

240
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
42 muscles would work.

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
But when someone smiles,

242
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,480
only 17 of them would work.

243
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,960
So, it's

244
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
better to stay happy.

245
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
Stop being angry, okay?

246
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,480
I was wrong.

247
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
You scolded me on our way back just now.

248
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,920
Didn't you talk back when I scolded you?

249
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,440
Fine. I won't talk back now.

250
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,160
Keep scolding then.

251
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Why should I scold you?

252
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,160
Do you think

253
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,040
I like to nag you?

254
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,720
Mumbling like a monk,

255
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,360
even I'm annoyed.

256
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Turn around.

257
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,400
Slowly.

258
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,080
Is it hot?

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,800
Look at you. You're an adult.

260
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
But you only get quick-frozen food

261
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
inside the fridge,.

262
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,320
Even expired ones are still inside.

263
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,120
You're so busy every day,

264
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,080
can't you eat something good?

265
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,360
Eat instant noodles every day.

266
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,320
And

267
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
you carried such a big handbag,

268
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,440
couldn't you at least put

269
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,040
a power bank in?

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Your phone is always out of battery.

271
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,520
I can't even reach you.

272
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,120
Do you know how scary it is to lose contact

273
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
with someone you're close to?

274
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,880
Do you know that?

275
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
What if there is

276
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,160
an emergency

277
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,640
and you can't contact the outside world?

278
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,600
What if you can't reach me?

279
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,480
If you

280
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
can't even take care of yourself,

281
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,640
and aren't responsible for yourself,

282
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
how can you be responsible for others?

283
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
Cool it down. It's hot.

284
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,760
You're back.

285
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,640
The things you asked for

286
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,560
are put in the cupboard.

287
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,040
Luo Luo should be sleeping now.

288
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,480
Why don't you sleep in Di's room?

289
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,240
You...

290
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,920
are too kind and too forgiving.

291
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,880
You shoulder everything yourself.

292
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,240
You keep thinking for others.

293
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
You'll get taken advantage of.

294
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,840
The problems that you were

295
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,520
involved in recently

296
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,800
happened all because of me.

297
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,160
I even pushed you to the front line

298
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,200
at the very crucial moment.

299
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
To be honest, about

300
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,360
the press conference,

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,760
I was a bit angry at the beginning.

302
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,400
Even towards you,

303
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
I had a tiny bit of doubt.

304
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,640
But when I thought about it afterwards,

305
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,600
you weren't wrong.

306
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,560
If you keep on

307
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
taking my side,

308
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,720
the public's misunderstanding towards me

309
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,520
would only be worse.

310
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,480
They'd look down on me more too.

311
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,040
Fine.

312
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,400
In the future,

313
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,560
you can just protect your dream,

314
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,840
and I'll protect you.

315
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,960
Did you watch movies recently?

316
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,120
Where did you learn the line from?

317
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,360
You're annoying.

318
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,520
Can you not expose me?

319
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm having a cold.

320
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,520
Sleep then.

321
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,040
What?

322
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,440
Stay by my side for a while.

323
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Sir, please have a look.

324
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,400
Are you okay?

325
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
If you're fine, can you stand up?

326
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,920
Be careful next time.

327
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,760
Bye.

328
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,120
Tang Jie, once these sample clothes

329
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
are finalized, they can

330
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,480
go straight into production.

331
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
I'll go notify them.

332
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,120
You You!

333
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm here.

334
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,120
Have you contacted

335
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,080
the models and studio?

336
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,200
Miss Fang,

337
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,040
didn't you mention that

338
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,280
you want a blockbuster-like vibe?

339
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,240
Then, we need to

340
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
work with a very skillful team.

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,240
I've contacted a few

342
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,920
pretty good studios.

343
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,640
But the price is

344
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,400
a bit too expensive.

345
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,960
Just use the team

346
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
that I worked with before.

347
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,480
You're here.

348
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,440
Here to report for duty.

349
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,760
Let me introduced to you.

350
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,280
This is Miss Izumino,

351
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,000
who's also our company's

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,640
new partner.

353
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,120
Hello, Miss Izumino.

354
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Please take care of me.

355
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,880
You're too polite.

356
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,480
It should be you

357
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,400
taking care of us.

358
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, yeah. You mentioned that

359
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,360
for models and studio,

360
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,280
we'll use your previous team?

361
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,960
Zhou Fang knows it.

362
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
That team is pretty good.

363
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,160
It's a top-notch team

364
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,960
in the country.

365
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,560
They must be very expensive.

366
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,520
It'll be expensive.

367
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,080
But their founder

368
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,360
and I are childhood friends.

369
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,280
Or else, I couldn't afford them either.

370
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
TKY Shop deserves the best.

371
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
Plus, Zhou Fang, with your personality,

372
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,120
it's either you don't do it

373
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,200
or you'll give it your best.

374
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,960
Am I right?

375
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,760
You know me well.

376
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,640
Thank you, Miss Izumino.

377
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,720
You You.

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,840
If Miss Izumino gives

379
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,600
any instructions,

380
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,360
try to cooperate.

381
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,440
No problem.

382
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Miss,

383
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,560
if you need anything,

384
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,280
just let me know.

385
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,720
Sure.

386
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,880
I'll get you a glass of water.

387
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,800
It's a bit far here, right?

388
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,520
It's alright. Thanks.

389
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,640
You don't look that well.

390
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,280
Are you okay?

391
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm okay. I'm having a cold.

392
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,320
I'll get better in two days.

393
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,200
Thank you

394
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,520
for helping me.

395
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,560
You're welcome.

396
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,560
Although I only promised

397
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,120
to work with you in the haute couture line,

398
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,720
if I have

399
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,600
the time,

400
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
I can help you with other stuff

401
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,920
of the company as well.

402
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
That'll be great.

403
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,120
In a few days, it'll be

404
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,720
the Shopping Festival.

405
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,920
You know about

406
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,840
the process and details

407
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
better than I do.

408
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,920
I'm sure there are many things

409
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,720
to learn from you.

410
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,720
I'll have to trouble you.

411
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,360
Since we have established

412
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,200
our partnership,

413
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,920
this will be part of my duty.

414
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
You don't have to be

415
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,840
too courteous with me.

416
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Sure. Got it.

417
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,360
Let me

418
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,160
show around inside.

419
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,440
Sure.

420
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,960
Kai!

421
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,960
This is Miss Izumino.

422
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,280
Bring Miss Izumino to look around.

423
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,000
Sure. Let's go, Miss.

424
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,960
I'll answer a call.

425
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,200
Mom.

426
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,520
Where are you?

427
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,040
At my studio. I'm busy.

428
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,760
No matter how busy you are, you need a rest too.

429
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,000
Think about how long it has been,

430
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,560
since you went shopping with me?

431
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm telling you, I'm feeling

432
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,000
very boring at home.

433
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,480
What about my dad?

434
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,320
Your dad?

435
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,760
Sounds like you don't know him.

436
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,720
The moment he steps in a shop,

437
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,520
he feels tight in his chest and gets palpitations.

438
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,440
Maybe some other day.

439
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,920
I've been very busy these days.

440
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,680
Then, tell me

441
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,960
when you are not busy.

442
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,960
I just thought of something.

443
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,320
It's been long since you and  dad

444
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,240
went for a vacation, isn't it?

445
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,280
How about this?

446
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
I'll sign you two up for a group.

447
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,600
You and dad can go travel.

448
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,760
You can enjoy yourselves for half a month,

449
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
make new friends,

450
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,280
and admire new scenery.

451
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,040
How about that?

452
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,960
I think it's good.

453
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,360
That's it for now. I'll hang up.

454
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
This girl...

455
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,120
She's using all her brainpower

456
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,040
to find ways to deal with me.

457
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Auntie, I think Zhou Fang...

458
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
is really busy.

459
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,920
Chen Dong.

460
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
I know I am right about you.

461
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,040
Look, even at this point,

462
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,760
you're still taking her side.

463
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,680
Chen Dong, uhm...

464
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,120
Don't be concerned.

465
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,960
Bravely, frankly,

466
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,720
tell me.

467
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,800
Is it because of Song Lin,

468
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
Zhou Fang started to distance herself from you?

469
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,160
No, Auntie. You've misunderstood.

470
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,000
Zhou Fang, Qin Qing and I,

471
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,720
are

472
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
very close friends.

473
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,160
But

474
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,880
recently, I have indeed

475
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,960
been busy with work.

476
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,920
All of us don't have time

477
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,560
to meet up.

478
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,040
So, we saw each other less.

479
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,280
You still refuse

480
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,440
to tell me about the truth.

481
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
Actually, I know

482
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,840
you have feelings for her.

483
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
Hence, you need to take action.

484
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,240
If there's anything you need,

485
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
any help from me,

486
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,720
You can tell me and let me know.

487
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,480
Auntie...

488
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,320
Thank you for your offer.

489
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Who Zhou Fang chooses

490
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
is her choice.

491
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,560
Feelings aren't something

492
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,880
that can be forced.

493
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,640
You're giving up so soon?

494
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
You're quitting?

495
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,760
No, Auntie. Don't get flustered.

496
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,920
It's not what I meant.

497
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,360
Zhou Fang is your daughter.

498
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,680
You definitely know her better

499
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,280
than anyone else.

500
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,880
If she has

501
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
made a decision,

502
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,600
it's hard to change her mind.

503
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
That's why I

504
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,720
was thinking

505
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,480
not to disturb her anymore.

506
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,720
You're back early.

507
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,200
Your daughter didn't accept my invitation.

508
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,000
What's there

509
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,120
to shop when I'm alone?

510
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,040
Have some water.

511
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,160
Old Wu just sent it over.

512
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,260
[Wedding Invitation]

513
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,960
Look at you.

514
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,960
Other people's child getting married

515
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,440
is supposed to be something happy.

516
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,520
Why are you sad?

517
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,160
Aren't you asking the obvious?

518
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,200
Our Zhou Fang

519
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,600
is three years younger than the person's child.

520
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,400
No rush.

521
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,000
It's not about the three-year gap.

522
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,360
They're having a belated wedding.

523
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,840
Their child is already one year old.

524
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
How about Zhou Fang?

525
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,800
She is mingling

526
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,880
with a man who is from

527
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,720
a totally different world.

528
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,480
What even is that?

529
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,400
Don't worry.

530
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,000
If she's in a rush,

531
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,080
she'll talk to you.

532
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,040
She'll give you

533
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,120
a chance to check out.

534
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
Put a sock in it.

535
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,840
When she tells us,

536
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
it'll be all too late.

537
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,800
Recently,

538
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,800
I really don't know

539
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,200
whether she's behaving herself.

540
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,120
Are you planning to follower her around again?

541
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,040
Why?

542
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
Can't I follow her around?

543
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,920
Even if I can't follow her around,

544
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,280
I must check her.

545
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,680
Why are you checking?

546
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,440
If you have the time,

547
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,520
both of us

548
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,120
can go travel.

549
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,280
How good!

550
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,120
Right. I went to travel.

551
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,960
I'm in France today,

552
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,840
going to Germany tomorrow.

553
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,600
I'll post them in my Moments.

554
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
Then, wouldn't she know

555
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
that I'm not around?

556
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,320
Yes.

557
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,120
That's the plan. Travel.

558
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,560
Old Zhou.

559
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,200
What is this for?

560
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,522
[I fell down this morning, do you remember?
Thanks for helping me.]

561
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,720
You don't know how to speak?

562
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,320
Thank you.

563
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
I appreciate it.

564
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,440
This...

565
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,680
You keep it for yourself.

566
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,160
You must be tiring.

567
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,360
Bye.

568
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,400
You...

569
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,120
Why did you come back?

570
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,080
Shen Pei Pei,

571
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,920
what are you trying to do?

572
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
I'm not trying to do anything.

573
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,120
I just...just...just want to...

574
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
Do you think it is fun?

575
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,640
I just wanted to see you.

576
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,360
But I'm scared that you'll

577
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,280
be unhappy if you see me.

578
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,280
That's why I'm doing this.

579
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,240
I didn't do it on purpose...

580
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,680
I did do it on purpose.

581
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,120
But I really can't think of

582
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,200
another way.

583
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,080
Sorry.

584
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
Please don't come again.

585
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,400
Wait a minute.

586
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,480
I'll just say two sentences. Just two sentences.

587
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,360
The matter between

588
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,520
Miss Fang and me before

589
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,840
was really a misunderstanding.

590
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
We were both cheated.

591
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,880
We're both victims.

592
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,840
Furthermore, I and Miss Fang and Miss Qing

593
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,720
are really

594
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,200
very good friends now.

595
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
I think you must have misunderstood.

596
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,360
I have no right to interfere with your matters.

597
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,840
You don't have to purposely

598
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,920
come here to explain to me.

599
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,840
We won't have

600
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,680
any interaction.

601
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,640
But...

602
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
But we have two

603
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
common friends.

604
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,720
Can you not be

605
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,760
that eager to push me away?

606
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,600
I'll get you to dispel

607
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
your prejudice against me.

608
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,280
Miss Shen Pei Pei,

609
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,000
have I

610
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,960
not made it clear enough?

611
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,040
I'm not interested

612
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,920
in your past.

613
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,840
I just hope that

614
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,800
you won't force me

615
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,640
to befriend you.

616
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,960
Everything you've done

617
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,920
makes me feel very...

618
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,160
Very disgusted.

619
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,640
Don't disturb me anymore.

620
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,120
Pretty good.

621
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,840
This tech company is

622
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,640
developing pretty well.

623
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
It's all because of your support.

624
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,960
I heard from Zhou Fang that...

625
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,840
you and Qin Qing

626
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,760
had a fight?

627
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,480
I broke up with her.

628
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,680
I'll give you two days off

629
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,360
to adjust yourself.

630
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,080
It's okay, Lin.

631
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Don't keep giving me off days.

632
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
Now that I can pay

633
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,080
all my attention to my work,

634
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,840
that's good.

635
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,760
Let me tell you.

636
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,720
For relationships,

637
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
sometimes separating for a short while

638
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,640
is good.

639
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,480
Two people can calm down

640
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,600
and feel

641
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
the life without each other.

642
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,200
Eventually, you'll figure it out.

643
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,200
You don't have to console me. I'm okay.

644
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
The relationship between me and Qin Qing

645
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,160
is like

646
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,280
a long trip.

647
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,160
Maybe she's just feeling tired now

648
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,280
and wants a rest.

649
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,080
If I keep forcing her to come with me,

650
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,360
we won't be able to

651
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,560
enjoy the scenes along the way.

652
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,440
Yeah.

653
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,240
How about you and Miss Fang?

654
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
When's the good news?

655
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,840
What good news?

656
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,040
This winter jujube crisp

657
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
is sweet, crispy and tasty.

658
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,960
This is your new design?

659
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,560
But the sketch isn't nice.

660
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,920
It can't be used.

661
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,880
I remember back in school,

662
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,040
the teacher said,

663
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,360
designers

664
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
should draw sketches more often.

665
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,000
Only then can one have

666
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,760
good basic skills.

667
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,880
But back then,

668
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,920
I was really too naughty.

669
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,840
All my time was wasted.

670
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,840
I think drawing sketches

671
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,120
is just an exhibition of skills.

672
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
Whether or not a design is good,

673
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,640
it depends on whether

674
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
it can give your customer

675
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,760
a pleasant user experience.

676
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,760
Recently, I've been

677
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,560
thinking about this as well.

678
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,680
Back then,

679
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,280
I used to treat

680
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,000
jewelry design

681
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,120
as a creation of art.

682
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
On the surface, it is to

683
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
express individuality.

684
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,640
But the truth is it was simply egocentric.

685
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,600
Now I know that

686
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,280
designs exist

687
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,080
to create value for customers.

688
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,760
It should center around

689
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,440
their needs.

690
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,560
The customers need

691
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,840
not just a diamond ring,

692
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,120
but the emotional story

693
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,080
behind the ring as well.

694
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,840
For instance, CRD

695
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,160
has been searching for

696
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,120
the western classics,

697
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,640
to really help the customers

698
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,680
choose right.

699

[Shen Pei Pei]

700
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,280
Your phone call.

701
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
How can Huo Chen Dong

702
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
speak so insensitively?

703
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,240
Between me and him,

704
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,320
there was nothing

705
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,440
to be sensitive about to begin with.

706
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I'll tell him off for you.

707
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,720
Please don't.

708
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,800
He'll just hate me more.

709
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,800
Actually, I think he was right.

710
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,880
My actions are

711
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,960
annoying.

712
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,000
You're not annoying. Don't think that way.

713
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,200
What do you want to eat for dinner?

714
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,320
I'll eat with you.

715
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,040
It's okay.

716
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,160
I took a leave in the day.

717
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
I need to make up for it at night.

718
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,560
The chief editor is waiting

719
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,360
for me to submit my article.

720
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,000
You're going back to work in this state.

721
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,720
Will you be okay?

722
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,520
I can't let this affect my work.

723
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,960
Or else, Huo Chen Dong

724
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,200
will really think that I am

725
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,880
the kind of person

726
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,240
who sits around doing nothing.

727
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,560
Thanks, Miss Fang.

728
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,280
I won't bother you then.

729
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,480
Okay then.

730
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,720
Be careful on your way back.

731
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,320
I'll get going.

732
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,560
I'll walk you out.

733
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Don't be sad.

734
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,040
Call me if there's anything.

735
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,400
Hello, Mom.

736
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,200
Fang, I just want to inform you.

737
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Don't come back this weekend.

738
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
Your dad and I,

739
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
and a few other friends

740
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
are going on a trip.

741
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,120
Self-driving tour.

742
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,120
That sudden?

743
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,240
I'm telling you,

744
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,320
these few days when I'm not around,

745
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,760
you need to behave yourself,

746
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,600
be obedient.

747
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,760
You understand?

748
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,800
Other than work,

749
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,920
what else can I do?

750
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,320
Okay. Take care.

751
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,280
Don't tire yourself.

752
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,800
Okay. That's all.

753
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,280
Okay. I'll hang up now.

754
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,440

You know what,

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
the team that Izumino

793
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,360
introduced this time is really good.

794

The photos all looked great.

795
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,440

796
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,520
have better connections.

getting along well recently.

799
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,520
I think so.

800
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,840
Unexpectedly smoothly.

801
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
We're getting along so well

802
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,200
that I find it hard to believe.

803
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,440
No.

804
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,360
It's late at night, I can't say

805
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,080
these unlucky things.

806
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,960
Let's hope that it'll get better.

807
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,920
Don't worry.

808
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,040
I won't mess up

809
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,640
this time.

810
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,240
You have never messed up before.

811
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,680
A few problems you had

812
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,480
were all because of me.

813
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,320
If it wasn't for you,

814
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,240
can I be so firm

815
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
to do what I want to do?

816
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,960
Then, promise me.

817
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,960
In the future, no matter what happens,

818
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,000
don't shoulder it yourself.

819
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,920
Tell me right away.

820
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,400
Okay?

821
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,840
Pinky swear.

822
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,120
Pinky, pinky bow-bell.

823
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,320
Stop avoiding. Seal.

824
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,320
I'll bite you.

825
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,400
Sealed.

826
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,720
Who is it?

827
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,520
I don't know.

828
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,160
Is it Luo Luo?

829
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,880
Luo Luo has the passcode.

830
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,440
Zhou Fang, open the door.

831
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
My mom.

832
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,520
Wait.

833
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,400
Isn't she on a trip?

834
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
How should I know?

835
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,080
Hurry, hurry.

836
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,920
Don't. Don't freak out.

837
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,520
Don't freak out.

838
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,440
How can I not freak out?

839
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,200
We have confirmed our relationship,

840
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,640
right?

841
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,600
We need to face this sooner or later.

842
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,680
I need to face her

843
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,120
directly.

844
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,480
No problem. Let her come in.

845
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,560
She can't come in.

846
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,440
-No problem.
-You need to hide.

847
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,680
If you face her now,

848
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,160
you won't be able

849
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,080
to face her next time. Hurry.

850
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,400
I can't chicken out, okay?

851
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,320
I can't.

852
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm chickened out. Hurry and hide.

853
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,800
Zhou Fang!

854
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,000
Open the door!

855
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,160
Mom.

856
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,800
Aren't you on a trip?

857
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,560
What are you doing here?

858
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,280
Coming back so suddenly.

859
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,760
What took you so long to open the door?

860
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,160
I...I was cleaning the house.

861
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,520
Who are you drinking with?

862
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,280
The wine's from last night.

863
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,760
With who?

864
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,360
Qin Qing.

865
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,960
Was it really Qin Qing?

866
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,160
It was really Qin Qing.

867
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,080
Mom.

868
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,760
What are you looking for?

869
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,440
Look at the mess you made of the wardrobe.

870
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,800
You're even looking at the toilet bowl?

871
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,240
Are you nervous?

872
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,400
I'm not nervous.

873
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,480
What am I nervous about?

874
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,240
You must be feeling guilty.

875
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,200
Am I right?

876
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,640
Why would I feel guilty?

877
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,160
I'm just looking at you coming in

878
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,280
and searching everywhere.

879
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,480
And I don't know what are you searching for.

880
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,720
Why don't you...

881
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,400
What are you doing?

882
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,680
Put it down.

883
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,200
We can have a chat here.

884
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,440
You didn't want

885
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,640
chat with me normally.

886
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,080
Can't we chat now?

887
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,040
I told you, mom.

888
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,080
I was cleaning and

889
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,400
tidying up the room just now.

890
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,640
What are you looking for?

891
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,920
You...

892
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,520
You know very well

893
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,640
what I'm doing.

894
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,120
Am I right?

895
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,240
Mom!

896
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,600
What are you doing?

897
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm giving a speech at the company tomorrow.

898
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,000
I need to warm up my voice.

899
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,320
Your broken voice.

900
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,520
You think after you warmed it up,

901
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,640
you can give a speech tomorrow?

902
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,880
You're out of your mind.

903
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,080
That's why I'm practicing.

904
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,960
Practicing, practicing.

905
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,720
Mom!

906
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,160
Godmother!

907
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,640
What are you doing?

908
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,440
Godmother! Why are you here?

909
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,640
You're carrying a big bag.

910
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,000
Godmother, let me tell you.

911
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,240
My brother is too much!

912
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,640
As soon as he came back, he just lied there.

913
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,080
He didn't care whether I've eaten or not.

914
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,480
Godmother, now that you're here,

915
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,120
how about you

916
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,040
cook something for me?

917
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,640
Your brother is lying at home?

918
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,120
Yeah! Isn't he too much?

919
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,360
Too much!

920
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,760
Too much. Uhm...

921
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,960
Don't worry. Let Godmother have a look

922
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
at what she has in her fridge

923
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
and make something good for you.

924
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,680
Godmother, you're so nice.

925
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,400
I'll have a look

926
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,240
and see what's in your fridge.

927
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,960
Mom, mom, mom.

928
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,840
What are you doing?

929
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,800
You are pulling my clothes...

930
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,680
What are you doing?

931
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,280
Mom.

932
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,680
Why don't you go in

933
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,480
and have a rest?

934
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,080
Wash your hands. Take a bath.

935
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
I'll order delivery.

936
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,280
The deliveries outside are not clean.

937
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
How would you know what oil

938
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,160
they used?

939
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,680
Of course, they

940
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,720
don't taste as good as my cooking.

941
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,120
Sit back and wait.

942
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,160
I want to eat Godmother's cooking.

943
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,280
I'll see

944
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,640
what's in the fridge.

945
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
In the fridge, there is romain lettuce,

946
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,080
and two eggs,

947
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
and tomatoes.

948
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,400
Who was it?

949
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,000
Why did you fart?

950
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
My bowel hasn't been feeling good, Godmother.

951
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
It was you?

952
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,760
And still, you wanted to get delivery? You kids.

953
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,040
Look at you here.

954
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,280
It stinks. Let's ventilate.

955
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,920
Mom! Mom!

956
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,320
What's wrong with you today?

957
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,480
Are you crazy?

958
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,560
I'm training my vocals.

959
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,720
Training my vocals.

960
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Your broken voice...

961
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,560
What are you training?

962
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,800
What are you doing?

963
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,160
