[Episode 44]

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,880
Welcome back!

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,759
Do you think there is a surprise?

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
No, it is not.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Do you want to

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,160
see your goddess?

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
No way.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
It's too late now.

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,880
Please come back early next time.

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,560
That's it.

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,200
Take a shower and then go to sleep.

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,720
I can't play it any more.

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,480
I'm just kidding.

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,400
Don't sleep first,

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
go and check out the wardrobe.

40
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,240
I've been planning this

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
for a while,

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,520
I wanted to give you this

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,440
as a Valentine's Day gift,

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
but I can wait no more.

45
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,320
You You, it's windy today.

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
Be careful when you go out.

47
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
See you at the office later.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,960
Okay, goodbye.

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,640
What are you doing?

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,200
Am I handsome?

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,200
Yes, you are.

52
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,240
Do you like it?

53
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,360
I love it.

54
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm in a good mood

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,000
wearing the clothes given by my love one

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,120
to go to work.

57
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,320
Let's go together.

58
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
Let's go.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,200
-Let's go together.
-Here we go.

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,400
Give me your hand.

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,000

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,520

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,680
President Song.

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
Let's go over there.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,760
Okay.

66
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,480
President Su,

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
Up to this point,

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
you still have the mood to play.

69
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,080
You're unflappable

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
and calm.

71
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,880
Don't make fun of me.

72
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,760
A lot of things have happened

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
to the company recently,

74
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,200
It's messy.

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,280
How do I continue to live my life

76
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,320
if I don't find ways to have fun?

77
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Don't you think so, President Song?

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,680
Indeed.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
So many bad things have happened at once.

80
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,480
I heard that

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
there's something wrong with your property,

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
and the loan cannot be approved.

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
You got the news so fast.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Yes.

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,920
I have too many enemies.

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,720
Anything could happen

87
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,800
at this moment.

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,480
The cause of leaking customer privacy

89
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
cannot be found,

90
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,920
and we have expected that

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,400
we'll lose the trust of customers.

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,000
President Song,

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,640
why do you want to meet me?

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,280
Our newly developed software

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,320
has been attacked

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,000
by hackers

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
recently.

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,600
Was it you?

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
It's understandable

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,440
to defend ourselves by doing something

101
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,200
at this moment, right?

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
But I can't control

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,680
who will be getting involved.

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm sorry about that.

105
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,720
I can understand.

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,760
Fortunately,

107
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
our firewall

108
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,880
has resisted

109
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,560
the hacker attack.

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,080
President Song, don't tell me

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,920
you're here to see

112
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
how I embarrass myself?

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Our company's

114
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,560
firewall

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
has now got a patent.

116
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,480
I can sell it to you.

117
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Does that mean

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,760
you want to help me?

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,760
Why?

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
It's not actually for you.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,640
Zhou Fang is still working for your company,

122
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,320
If your company

123
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,360
goes bankrupt,

124
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
she will get affected too.

125
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,200
And

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
I've put

127
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
a lot of effort

128
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,280
in Wan Feng Group

129
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,480
and Chuang Pin Net,

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,880
I can't bear

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,680
to watch them go bankrupt.

132
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
I have an idea.

133
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,920
We can cooperate on

134
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,960
the online clothes fitting,

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
making it into a bigger business.

136
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,600
That will be nice

137
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,200
for

138
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,120
the whole industry.

139
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm not sure whether
you're being sincere or not.

140
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,960
Anyway,

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,960
thank you for that.

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,440
It's funny that

143
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
I've been treating you as an enemy

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
for so many years.

145
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Maybe it's because you're too strong

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,120
or maybe because I'm too obsessive.

147
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,840
I didn't expect you to help me

148
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,880
in the end.

149
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
Actually,

150
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,400
I have lots of friends.

151
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
But I didn't expect that

152
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,320
they would run away

153
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,039
when something happened to me.

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
But I have not failed yet.

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,919
Thank you.

156
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,960
Don't say that.

157
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
In this world,

158
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
whatever you do,

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
there must be competitors

160
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
and enemies

161
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
Even if it wasn't you,

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,520
there will still be others being my rivals.

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,120
Same theory, there will be other enemies,

164
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,800
if it wasn't me.

165
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,840
Instead,

166
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
I have to thank you.

167
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,440
For so many years,

168
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,720
you've been around

169
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,680
and

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
given me a lot of pressure

171
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
and motivation

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
as well.

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,440
I have no idea on

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,160
how to describe our relationship.

175
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,960
Instead of saying that you're an enemy,

176
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,360
it is better to say that

177
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,920
you're indeed a good opponent.

178
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,120
Thanks.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,640
I can't drink too much.

180
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,840
President Song,

181
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,520
I think we shouldn't

182
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,280
sell the patent.

183
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
We're invincible

184
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,240
because

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
we're relying on

186
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,360
a security system

187
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,000
that no one else has.

188
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,280
We should take advantage of the gap

189
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,840
that our competitors are focusing on upgrading,

190
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,560
to stabilize

191
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,640
our online customization system.

192
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
If we sell it

193
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,160
to Su Yu Shan,

194
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,080
it would be like

195
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,040
back-stabbing ourselves.

196
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,920
That's right. President Song,

197
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,160
what are you thinking?

198
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,400
We can't sell the patent

199
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,320
to others.

200
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,760
We need it.

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
I think that

202
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,840
President Song

203
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
must have his own thoughts.

204
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,440
President Song, you have to believe us.

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
We don't have to concede.

206
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,760
We can handle

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,400
their attack.

208
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,880
He is right.

209
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
I have

210
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,200
made my decision.

211
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,680
Everybody, get ready,

212
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll sign the contract tomorrow.

213
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,040
In fact, I know that

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
no one would agree with me

215
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,160
on signing this contract.

216
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
But I never expect that

217
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
you would be the first to agree on it.

218
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,640
Su Yu Shan did offer

219
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,720
quite a high price to us

220
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,160
and we didn't lose anything.

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,920
From an investment perspective,

222
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,800
I earn a lot

223
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,560
as a shareholder.

224
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,960
You agreed on it

225
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,680
because of Wan Feng Group, right?

226
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
It was me giving an opinion

227
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
while my previous employer

228
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
decided to take over Wan Feng Group.

229
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,000
And all businesses I handled

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
have never failed.

231
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,040
If you could make

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
such a big decision,

233
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,680
I couldn't agree more.

234
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,880
Song Lin,

235
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,120
I think it's time

236
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
for me to quit.

237
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,080
I'm tired.

238
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,240
I need some rest.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,240
It's been five to six years

240
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,400
that I haven't had a holiday.

241
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,920
I've decided that

242
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm going to make a life planning

243
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
during my holiday.

244
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,000
I hope you

245
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
have a wonderful holiday.

246
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,040
Anyway,

247
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,720
thank you.

248
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
Thank you

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
for helping me and supporting me

250
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
for all this while.

251
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,440
I've earned money,

252
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm getting one step closer to my goal

253
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
of being a rich woman.

254
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,760
A rich woman.

255
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,920
Best cooperation.

256
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,840
Best cooperation.

257
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,320
Song Lin has successfully signed

258
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,240
a contract with Wan Feng.

259
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,000
I heard that

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
you had helped a lot.

261
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,800
This contract

262
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,720
has successfully

263
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,760
made Wan Feng Group

264
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,600
overcome another difficulty.

265
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,480
In fact,

266
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,360
when I left

267
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,240
the company,

268
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,640
I wanted to prove that

269
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,440
my judgment

270
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,560
was correct

271
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
through my own efforts.

272
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,520
Your judgment

273
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,360
was always right.

274
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,840
I still remember that

275
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
you quit

276
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,120
in this office.

277
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,920
And now,

278
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,560
in this office,

279
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,200
I would like to invite you

280
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
to join our company.

281
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,320
Thank you for your recognition.

282
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
It's a great honor

283
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,120
to hear that,

284
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,360
but now

285
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm worth a lot more

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,040
than before.

287
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,240
Welcome back.

288
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,400
Zhou Fang.

289
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,440
How would you know I am here?

290
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,360
Of course, I know.

291
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm your girlfriend.

292
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,720
You know me very well.

293
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Sure.

294
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,960
You'll hide here

295
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,080
whenever

296
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,560
there's something big happened.

297
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,720
Why would you decide

298
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
to sell the patent to Su Yu Shan?

299
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,680
You asked me before that

300
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
why can't we have a win-win situation

301
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,520
with Su Yu Shan,

302
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
which reminded me.

303
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,640
So it's because of me?

304
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,200
It's for you

305
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
and it's for Wan Feng group as well.

306
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,240
It's also for the industry

307
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
to get better.

308
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,320
I put a lot of effort

309
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,400
in Wan Feng Group,

310
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,440
I can't bear to see it fail.

311
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,320
And you're working for

312
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,360
Su Yu Shan,

313
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,120
if he fails,

314
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,880
it will be no good for you.

315
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,320
Am I right?

316
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,200
I think that

317
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,120
if we work together,

318
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,720
we could build a better future

319
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
for the industry.

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,920
Song Lin,

321
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
aren't you tired?

322
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,920
Do you think that

323
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
it's a win-win situation?

324
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Of course, it is.

325
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm not tired.

326
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
I feel good when you're with me.

327
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,280
Zhou Fang,

328
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,320
will you still feel

329
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,400
insecure

330
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,360
in our relationship?

331
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,440
No.

332
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,600
I have always felt safe with you.

333
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,880
That's good.

334
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,920
Do you know what I like you

335
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
the most?

336
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,240
Because I'm handsome?

337
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,800
You're handsome,

338
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,720
but there's another point.

339
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,160
You never

340
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,120
make promises easily,

341
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,360
but you'll get it done,

342
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,640
once you make one.

343
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,040
I still remember

344
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,640
you told me to protect my dreams

345
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,840
and you're going to protect me.

346
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,120
Ever since

347
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,280
you told me that,

348
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,840
I felt like I was Saint Seiya

349
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
wearing

350
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,720
Gold Cloth.

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
I can

352
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,840
do anything

353
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,840
without

354
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
any worries.

355
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,440
Don't be so exaggerated.

356
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm not exaggerating, I'm serious.

357
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,160
That's because

358
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,800
you're good,

359
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,400
and you're learning fast.

360
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,400
You can do everything right.

361
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,560
Sometimes, I feel like

362
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,240
I have nothing

363
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,760
to give to you.

364
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,960
Actually, I'm

365
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,040
having some issues.

366
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,800
I feel like

367
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm standing at a crossroad,

368
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,080
the future is unpredictable,

369
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,320
it could be good or bad.

370
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,480
I have no idea.

371
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,240
Sometimes,

372
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,800
I don't even know

373
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,960
how long I can protect you.

374
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,280
Why do you always

375
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,400
want to be a giver?

376
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
You've given me a lot.

377
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,680
I didn't mean to be with you

378
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,319
so that you could help

379
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,000
or protect me.

380
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,319
To be honest,

381
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,920
I've thought a lot.

382
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,800
Apart from our social status

383
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,599
and family status,

384
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
I don't know

385
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,680
our values.

386
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,480
Do we deserve to be loved?

387
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,240
What's on your mind?

388
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,000
Have you had your conclusion?

389
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,680
Apart from all of it,

390
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,960
I can only conclude that

391
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,000
you're lovely.

392
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,720
I think I love you.

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're not sure about that?

394
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,920
How about you? Do you love me?

395
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,480
Probably.

396
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,720
What? Say it again.

397
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,960
I think

398
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,160
I have found

399
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,680
my soul mate.

400
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,720
Really?

401
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,560
If it's true,

402
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
why don't you propose?

403
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,720
Aren't you afraid that I might run away?

404
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,040
I'm not afraid, I believe you.

405
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,160
Don't believe me.

406
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,480
Well, if you aren't proposing to me,

407
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,080
I'll do it.

408
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,120
Stand properly.

409
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,960
Song Lin.

410
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,400
Marry me.

411
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,400
Why don't you answer me?

412
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
You're not supposed to do this.

413
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,000
This is what I should say.

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,160
Take back your words, alright?

415
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,680
It's not funny at all.

416
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,840
Zhou Fang.

417
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
I...

418
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,680
I used to think that

419
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,640
I was very unlucky.

420
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,640
I lost my parents at an early age

421
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,280
and I was left with a younger sister

422
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,960
who caused trouble every day.

423
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
I didn't have my own life.

424
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
But gladly, the business

425
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,640
was going well.

426
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,480
But I was like a machine,

427
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
being busy working every day.

428
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,320
It was totally impersonal.

429
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
But later, I met you

430
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,120
and fell in love with you,

431
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,840
my life became

432
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,880
more meaningful.

433
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Knowing you

434
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,320
and being with you

435
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,240
is the best thing

436
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
that I have ever done.

437
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,680
It's the best thing

438
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,520
ever happened to me.

439
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,320
We still have a long way to go.

440
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,160
I don't know what will happen

441
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,840
in the future,

442
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,720
but there's one thing that

443
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,880
I'm sure of.

444
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,440
I hope that you can stay with me

445
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,280
for the rest of my life.

446
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
I have prepared

447
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,000
this ring for a while,

448
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,320
and I always wanted to

449
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,040
give it to you,

450
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
but I don't know

451
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,480

Thanks, mum.

480
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,240
Mum,

481
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,080
why are you insist on calling me home?

482
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,960
Is there anything?

483
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,120
No,

484
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,640
I just want to

485
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,920
prepare a healthy meal

486
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,080
for you.

487
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,000
Here you go, eat some pork kidneys.

488
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,480
It's good for your kidney.

489
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Qin Qing,

490
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,760
you too, you should

491
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,120
eat more healthy food.

492
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,760
Haven't you heard from the doctor?

493
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,320
You have the status of sub-health.

494
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,840
Thank you, Ms Tian.

495
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,680
Eat.

496
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,960
Mum, let's eat.

497
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay, I'm eating.

498
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,080
Mum, I have to go back to the office.

499
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
Do you need a ride?

500
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,120
Wait,

501
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,640
why are you going back to the office?

502
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,840
Mum,

503
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,160
I have

504
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,280
my own company now.

505
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
I'm really busy.

506
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
You asked me to come home,

507
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,440
and I did.

508
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,320
I thought there was

509
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,040
something important.

510
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,120
Of course, there's something important.

511
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,800
What is it?

512
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,200
Today is a special day,

513
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,720
don't you think it's important?

514
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,320
Okay, I have to wash dishes.

515
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,880
Rest early.

516
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,000
Qin Qing.

517
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,280
I need your help.

518
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,960
Where are you now?

519
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,200
I'm at home.

520
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,280
Okay, I'll be right there.

521
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm screwed.

522
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm so screwed.

523
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
I thought that you have settled

524
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,800
everything

525
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,880
with Ms Tian.

526
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,960
No, it's not.

527
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,640
Listen to me.

528
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,600
Last night,

529
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,640
she forced me to sleep with Wu San,

530
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
and she said I'm getting older,

531
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,760
I'm almost 30.

532
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm going to miss

533
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,120
the best time to get pregnant.

534
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,800
Seriously?

535
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,720
Am I a baby-making machine

536
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,560
to her?

537
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,800
In order to get pregnant,

538
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,880
I'm not allowed to eat this

539
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
or that.

540
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,480
Coco also got locked up

541
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,320
in the basement.

542
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,440
How could my life

543
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,480
end up in this way?

544
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,080
Don't be angry.

545
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
How did Wu San respond to it?

546
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,480
He kept comforting me.

547
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,360
We barely slept.

548
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,560
I think you and Wu Shan

549
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,480
have to figure it out,

550
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,240
and discuss with Ms Tian.

551
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,960
Do you think

552
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,040
she would want to discuss?

553
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
That's her order.

554
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
It's been a long journey

555
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
for you and Wu San.

556
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
It's such a waste

557
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,360
to end a relationship

558
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,160
because of this.

559
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,360
It's been really tough

560
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,120
for us.

561
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,920
It kills me for seeing him

562
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,520
get stuck

563
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,280
between his mother and me.

564
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,520
But...

565
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,240
You haven't got married,

566
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,120
you wouldn't know the feeling.

567
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,360
It's indeed

568
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,920
not easy, can you understand?

569
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,600
I have no idea

570
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,520
when she will be satisfied

571
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
about me.

572
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,360
Don't be so pessimistic.

573
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,560
We can figure it out

574
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,360
together.

575
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,240
Who could that be at this hour?

576
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,120
Qin Qing.

577
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,640
Qin Qing.

578
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,480
I feel like crying.

579
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,080
Don't cry, don't cry.

580
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,760
Don't cry.

581
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,920
It's okay, it's okay.

582
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,680
Go and open the door.

583
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
I'll go, don't you cry.

584
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,600
I've made oyster soup

585
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
for you,

586
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,400
I heard that it's good for women

587
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,040
when they're preparing for pregnancy.

588
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,120
It's very nutritious.

589
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,160
Here you go.

590
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,400
Ms Tian, I have had a meal,

591
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,600
I'm full.

592
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
You have to drink.

593
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,880
Didn't you hear

594
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,680
what the doctor said?

595
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
The doctor said

596
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
you have a status of sub-health.

597
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,080
You need to replenish nutrients,

598
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,840
and this very nutritious.

599
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,520
I've spent hours on it.

600
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,920
Come on, have some.

601
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,080
Ms Tian,

602
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
she never

603
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,040
eats oysters.

604
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
You don't like oysters?

605
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,000
You...

606
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,040
Are you allergic to oyster?

607
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm not allergic to it.

608
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,800
I just

609
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,920
dislike the taste.

610
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,560
As long as you're not allergic to it.

611
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,160
It contains a lot of nutrition.

612
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,640
If you don't like the taste,

613
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,160
you can hold your nose

614
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,640
and drink it.

615
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,360
You wouldn't smell anything.

616
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,000
Ms Tian,

617
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,240
I've bought

618
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,120
breakfast for her.

619
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,040
She is already full.

620
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,920
She can drink no more.

621
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,200
What's wrong with you both?

622
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,600
This is for your own sake.

623
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,360
How could you act like
I'm doing something bad to you?

624
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,080
You've promised me that

625
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
you're preparing for pregnancy.

626
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,480
Ms Tian,

627
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,080
I think we shouldn't force her

628
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,280
if she doesn't want to drink.

629
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,120
If she...

630
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,600
Zhou Fang,

631
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,880
it's okay, I can drink.

632
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,640
Are you alright?

633
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,880
Drink more.

634
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,760
It's not that bad, right?

635
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Great.

636
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,160
Okay, you can go on.

637
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,560
I'll

638
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
prepare lunch for you

639
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,240
later.

640
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,960
Okay.

641
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,840
Thank you.

642
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,400
You go on.

643
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
I'm leaving.

644
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,360
Water, faster.

645
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,360
That's so disgusting.

646
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,680
Why don't you

647
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,360
reject her

648
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,200
if you can't accept it?

649
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,600
I can't.

650
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,920
If I

651
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
don't drink it today,

652
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,040
there will be

653
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,800
new problems tomorrow.

654
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,800
She has finally agreed

655
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,600
on our relationship,

656
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,960
if I have issues

657
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,680
with her,

658
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,480
what should I do with Wu San?

659
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,480
It was really disgusting.

660
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,760
This is my first time

661
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,840
seeing you compromise to something.

662
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
What should I do?

663
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,200
It will be fine.

00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,800
Sweetheart,

666
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,080
are you okay?

667
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,800
Hello? Wu San, it's me,

Miss Fang.

671
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,160
Did my mum come over again?

672
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,960
Nothing happened.

673
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,000
Do spend some time with her

674
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
once you're done.

675
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,440
Don't worry, Miss Fang,

676
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
I'll request for an annual leave

677
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,120
and spend some time with her

678
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,680
after I go through

679
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,680
the handover procedure of work.

680
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,120
Okay.

681
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,840
Good job, Wu San.

I have something to tell you.

685

Zhou Fang has told me everything.

Go ahead, it's okay.

Hello, mum.

Lin,

689
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
there must be something wrong

690
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,840
with Qin Qing.

00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
What's wrong with her?

692
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,600
Listen up,

693
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,880
I've brought lunch for her.

694
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,200
But she's gone

in the blink of an eye.

And she didn't pick up my call.

Okay, I got it.

00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
staying at home,

701
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,600
but now she's gone.

702
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,040
Lin, I...

703
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Go and look for her.

704
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Okay, Lin, I'm leaving now.

705
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,280
I'll be by your side

706
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,080
if you want to stay quiet,

707
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,480
and if you want to talk,

708
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,480
I'm here to listen as well.

709
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,040
I've made up my mind

710
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,920
while I was on my way here,

711
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,360
I must find a way

712
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,960
to solve it.

713
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,920
How could you

714
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,480
be so good to me?

715
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,800
Sweetheart,

716
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,280
it's okay to cry

717
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,960
if you're sad.

718
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm here for you.

719
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,120
If you have something to say, say it.

720
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
Don't worry.

721
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,280
We're married now,

722
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,960
and you're my wife.

723
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,320
Wu San,

724
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,720
I'm afraid.

725
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,600
What are you afraid of?

726
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,800
I'm afraid that I can no longer

727
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
live my life freely like before

728
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,960
after I get married.

729
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,600
And I'm afraid of Ms Tian.

730
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I don't know

731
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,240
how to get along with her.

732
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm afraid that you'll be sad

733
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
if you get stuck between us.

734
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,520
It's my fault.

735
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,000
I was too busy

736
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,680
to take care of you.

737
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,600
I should have

738
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,320
handled this matter,

739
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,840
I shouldn't

740
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,680
make you feel sad.

741
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,040
You were so busy,

742
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,120
it's not your fault.

743
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,920
I can understand, I'm serious.

744
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,440
But...

745
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,120
But what?

746
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,800
Wu San.

747
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,760
To be honest,

748
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,440
To be honest,

749
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,480
I never yearn for marriage,

750
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,200
because it's trivial

751
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
and long.

752
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
It's true of a child.

753
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,640
how am I

754
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,520
able to raise a child

755
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,920
while I can't even

756
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,040
take care of myself.

757
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm not ready

758
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,680
for these.

759
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,640
I wanted to marry you,

760
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
not because it's time for me to do so,

761
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,200
but because I want to

762
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,440
stay with you for the rest of my life.

763
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,040
If getting married means that

764
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,320
we can no longer be ourselves,

765
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,760
then why are we

766
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,320
doing it?

767
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,360
Sweetheart,

768
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,480
would you

769
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,160
give me a second chance?

770
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,800
No matter what,

771
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,080
I promise you,

772
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,120
in our marriage life

773
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
or even if after we have kids in the future,

774
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,360
you can still be yourself

775
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,600
doing anything

776
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,320
you want to do.

777
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,360
If you wish to go travel,

778
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,080
then go.

779
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,960
We can do whatever we want

780
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,560
as long as we're happy.

781
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,719
Would that be okay?

782
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,159
Do you think that's possible?

783
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,760
We have lost control

784
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,719
of our life anymore.

785
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,040
Don't worry,

786
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,960
I'll go and persuade my mum.

787
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,480
Don't go.

788
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,120
I don't want to cause

789
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
any conflicts between you two.

790
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
She is your mother after all,

791
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,199

[Qin Qing]

803
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,880
Lin,

804
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,200
you're back.

805
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,600
Mum.

806
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,960
Have you found Qin Qing?

807
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,600
Yes.

808
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,000
You must be tired,

809
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,560
you should go and rest.

810
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,920
Mum, have a seat.

811
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,720
Mum,

812
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
I need to talk with you.

813
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,720
What is it?

814
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,960
There is something we can't talk through.

815
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:10,920
Mum,

816
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,160
what do you mean by

817
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
"can't talk through"?

818
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Isn't it normal to get married

819
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,880
and have a baby?

820
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,280
Qin Qing doesn't want to have a baby

821
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,160
or what?

822
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,480
It's me.

823
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,680
She's almost 30.

824
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
She's going to miss the best time

825
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,200
to get pregnant.

826
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,480
Mum,

827
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,760
I hope you can understand that

828
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,040
I got married to Qin Qing,

829
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,880
not because

830
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,920
I want her to give me a baby,

831
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
or force her to change.

832
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,080
I just like her

833
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,520
being free and unrestrained.

834
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,920
She can do anything

835
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,000
as long as she is happy.

836
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,200
This is

837
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,160
our life,

838
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,080
could you

839
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,160
give us some space?

840
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
Okay, fine.

841
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Now you're an adult,

842
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,600
and you don't need me anymore.

843
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
I've told you,

844
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,200
you have affected by her

845
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,480
in a negative way.

846
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,320
You were such a good boy

847
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,520
when you were a child.

848
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,920
Look at you now,

849
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,560
you're helping the outsider

850
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,840
not me.

851
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,440
Mum,

852
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,640
how could you

853
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,800
say that?

854
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,800
We have got married.

855
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Qin Qing is my wife,

856
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
and she's your daughter-in-law.

857
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,360
Can't you just stop forcing her?

858
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,880
I'm forcing her?

859
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,960
Okay, fine.

860
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,640
I shouldn't have agreed

861
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,160
with your marriage.

862
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Both of you lied to me,

863
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,280
how could you speak so assuredly

864
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,840
without feeling ashamed?

865
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,040
Mum,

866
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,000
have you ever thought about

867
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,600
why we lied to you?

868
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Have you ever thought that

869
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,160
it could be your problem?

870
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,360
Since I was a child,

871
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,400
you have always wanted to control me.

872
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
In fact, I wasn't willing to do

873
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,120
many things you asked,

874
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
but I did

875
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,720
and did them well.

876
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,720
All I wanted

877
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,520
was to make you feel proud

878
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,680
in front of

879
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,440
your colleagues.

880
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,240
But I'm an adult now,

881
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,120
I know what is right

882
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,160
and wrong.

883
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm no longer

884
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,600
a kid without judgment.

885
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,520
You're my mum, of course, I respect you,

886
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,720
but Qin Qing is my wife,

887
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,560
I have a responsibility to protect her.

888
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,600
Can you stop interfering

889
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,960
in our lives?

890
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,680
Fine.

891
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,040
I will stay out of your life.

892
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,080
I will not force you anymore.

893
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,800
Go.

894
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,520
Leave now.

895
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,760
From now on,

896
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,480
you just mind your business,

897
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,440
and I will do mine.

898
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,680
We shall not interfere with one another.

899
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,520
Leave.

900
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm sorry, mum.

901
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,240
Sorry.

902
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,240
You're back.

903
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,800
You stay up.

904
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,200
I've been waiting for you.

905
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,640
How is it?

906
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,760
What did your mum say?

907
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,680
She has agreed that

908
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,600
we can live our own life.

909
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,960
Really?

910
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,080
Yes.

911
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,880
I don't have to prepare for pregnancy?

912
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,480
And we can plan for the trip now?

913
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,600
We can go wherever

914
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,360
you like.

915
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,480
Great.

916
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,000
That's not right, Wu Shan.

917
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Why would she agree

918
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,240
all of a sudden?

919
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,000
Did she get mad?

920
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,240
She did?

921
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,520
Then...

922
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,560
It's okay.

923
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,880
Don't worry about that.

924
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,120
From now on,

925
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,120
you can do

926
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,200
whatever you want,

927
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,040
as long as you are happy.

928
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,960
Thank you.

929
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,440
Morning, President Zhou.

930
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:44,760
Morning.

931
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,040
Hi, President Zhou.

932
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,680
Hi.

933
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,560
Morning.

934
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,360
Morning.

935
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,280
Zhou Fang.

936
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,120
President Su, what brings you here?

937
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,800
Do you have time for coffee?

938
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,160
Sure.

939
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,080
Let's go.

940
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,280
So it will officially launch

941
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,120
tomorrow?

942
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,240
Yes.

943
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,280
It's all

944
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,880
because of your boyfriend.

945
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,560
I didn't expect him

946
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,640
to be so talented.

947
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,880
That's how he is.

948
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I heard that you are shortlisted

949
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,360
for CFTA.

950
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,400
Great, congratulations.

951
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,400
I didn't expect that President Su

952
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,160
got this news fast.

953
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
I've only got to know today.

954
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,840
If it wasn't you

955
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,920
and Song Lin,

956
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,760
I wouldn't hold up until now.

957
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,120
Don't you ever say that.

958
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,760
There will still be others if it wasn't us

959
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,360
In this era,

960
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,080
talented people will get recognized by others.

961
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,880
Thank you.

962
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,960
Zhou Fang,

963
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,600
I have something personal

964
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,720
to talk to you.

965
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,120
But I wonder if you mind?

966
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,880
Go ahead, I want to know.

967
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,960
During this period,

968
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,240
I've been asking myself,

969
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,720
why I have to take back

970
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,920
Si Yue Brand

971
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,320
from Song Lin?

972
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,240
Do I

973
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,760
really love

974
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,680
the brand?

975
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,520
Or...

976
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,320
Or it's just

977
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,640
my obsession with Si Yue.

978
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,720
A few days ago, my wife asked me

979
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,680
whether my destination

980
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,400
is what I truly want.

981
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,240
President Su,

982
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,320
although

983
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I've only seen Mrs Su

984
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,600
for a few times,

985
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,880
and we're not really close to each other,

986
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,560
but I can tell that

987
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,040
she loves you very much.

988
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,040
she must

989
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,440
have waiting for you

990
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,360
