26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
Who is it this time?

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,760
I knew you would come.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
If I don't come now,

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
I won't even have the energy to wake up

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,000
or eat anymore.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Stop looking.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,120
My mom is doing a home visit

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
at her student's house.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,440
What if she lied to you?

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,040
Impossible.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Come here.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
I haven't seen you for days.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,680
Look at you. You lost weight again.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,640
You haven't eaten on time,

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,280
have you?

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,200
My stomach hasn't been feeling well these days.

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
A bit of gastric reflux.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Have you seen a doctor?

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,080
Yes.

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
The doctor prescribed me some medicine

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,160
and asked me to take it for a week.

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,080
If it doesn't get better,

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
I need to go back for a follow-up.

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Did the doctor say

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,840
what the reason is?

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,280
It's not a big deal.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
Irregular eating habits.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Plus, I was indeed pretty tired

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
before this.

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
I was stressed out mentally too.

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Sweetheart.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,480
I guess my mom is

58
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
giving you a really hard time.

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,720
If she's willing to change her view towards me,

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,480
I can bear everything.

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm just scared that

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
no matter how much effort I make,

64
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
she wouldn't change her mind at all.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,920
Qin Qing.

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Let's get married.

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,840
Let's get married.

68
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Have you thought it through?

69
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,640
I've been thinking about it

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,840
for some time.

71
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,160
The two of us being together,

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
being in a relationship, and getting married,

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
are all our matters.

74
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,960
I know it was hard for my mom
to give birth to me

75
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,600
and raise me,

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
but she can't

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,440
decide everything for me.

78
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
I don't know why

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
my mom has been

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
more controlling towards me recently.

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
She wasn't like this before.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,840
I think

83
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
this is my fault as well.

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't do everything

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
as she pleases.

86
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,640
It's not wrong that we two

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,120
are together.

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,880
You've put in

89
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,760
so much effort for me,

90
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
you were troubled and wronged.

91
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
It's time

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
for me to do something.

93
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Do you agree?

94
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,440
What do you think?

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,959
That's not right.

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
We need to register to get married.

97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,960
We go register then.

98
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
Household Register is needed to register.

99
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,840
My Household Register is here.

100
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,760
How about yours?

101
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,880
This is a problem.

102
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,160
Do you think

103
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
I was too rash?

104
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,520
To meet someone that can make you so rash

105
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
to get married immediately,

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
how lucky it is!

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,840
Just get married.

108
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,320
You'll do it sooner or later anyway.

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,440
You really think so?

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,520
Yeah.

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,280
As for the aftermath,

112
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,880
have you two

113
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,840
thought about how to handle it?

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
It's not a small matter

115
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,880
to act first and inform later.

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,840
I don't think

117
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,480
it's good to hide it from Ms Tian.

118
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,880
But we really have

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
no other choice.

120
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,960
That's true.

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,640
But I think

122
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,320
you two can

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,440
change from being passive to active.

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,640
So as to

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
remind Ms Tian that

126
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
not everything

127
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
is within

128
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
her control.

129
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
I mean Wu San is already

130
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,240
an adult.

131
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
He has his own judgment

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,360
and right to decide,

133
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,800
right?

134
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,840
Go ahead. I support you.

135
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
Your support is all I need.

136
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,280
Just

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,200
wait for my good news.

138
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,120
Surprisingly, a no-marriage person

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,040
like you

140
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,400
would

141
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,920
get married before me.

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
If it was in the past,

143
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
I wouldn't even dare to imagine.

144
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,040
I was no-marriage because I hadn't met

145
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,960
the person I wanted to marry.

146
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,320
It's different now.

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,920
No matter who's stopping me,

148
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,400
I would marry him.

149
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Fine.

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
You're not young now and

151
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,640
you met someone

152
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,000
who you're willing to sacrifice everything.

153
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,640
Please be happy.

154
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
Back at you.

155
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Congratulations to you too.

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
Okay. Let's stop here. It's late now.

157
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sleepy. Go to sleep.

158
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,720
Hurry and drink the milk.

159
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,840
Mom.

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm not a kid anymore.

161
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
Aren't you going to work?

162
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,280
You don't have work today?

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,520
I do.

164
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,400
I can go a bit later.

165
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,800
Let me tell you.

166
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,000
Afterwards, don't keep eating out.

167
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,240
The food outside

168
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
is neither nutritious nor clean.

169
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,880
Understand?

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,160
I know, Mom.

171
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Hurry and drink it.

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,720
Mom, let me clear the dishes.

173
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
Hurry and go to work.

174
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,600

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Mom, you're at home.

351
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,880
If so, why didn't you switch on the lights?

352
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Don't call me Mom.

353
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,760
Mom.

354
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,920
I was wondering why you were

355
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,600
so eager to see me out early in the morning.

356
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,080
I thought my son

357
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,480
was loving and caring

358
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
about me.

359
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
it turned out that you took

360
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,360
the Household Register to get married covertly.

361
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,240
Do you still take me

362
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,160
as your mother?

363
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,400
Mom.

364
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,160
I was wrong.

365
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,120
But we didn't register.

366
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,640
Didn't register?

367
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
You're lying to me again?

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
Stop making up stories.

369
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,040
Because of Qin Qing,

370
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
how many times have you lied to me?

371
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,800
Mom, we really didn't register.

372
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
Qin Qing suddenly felt

373
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,000
that it was inappropriate,

374
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,320
and that we would do wrong

375
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,400
for ourselves and you.

376
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,040
I don't believe

377
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,360
she has that good intention.

378
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
Show me the marriage certificate.

379
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,240
Let me have a look and admire it.

380
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,560
Mom, I didn't get married.

381
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,360
How can I show you

382
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,080
a marriage certificate?

383
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
Why don't you believe me?

384
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm sleepy. I'll go to my room.

385
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,640
Household Register.

386
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
You rest early too.

387
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,680
That's how it went.

388
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,680
Before you

389
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
did this kind of things,

390
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
why couldn't you

391
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
discuss with me first?

392
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
Tian... Ms Tian has known about it

393
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,640
now, right?

394
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Zhou Fang, I'm telling you

395
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,520
you're responsible for

396
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
this idea too.

397
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,760
No, I mean...

398
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,240
Why are you youngsters

399
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,920
so rash

400
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,960
when you handle things?

401
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,600
You say that San Wu... He...

402
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,560
Wu San.

403
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,120
Whether he's Wu San or Wu Si,

404
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,520
he is Ms Tian's son.

405
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,880
If he clashes with his mom,

406
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,360
they are still mother and son.

407
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,760
But you're different.

408
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
Ms Tian would think that

409
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,040
you were the one who had provoked...

410
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Wu San.

411
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,280
Great. Great.

412
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,680
We're getting more passive now.

413
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
More and more passive.

414
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,720
I shouldn't have

415
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,680
promised Wu San.

416
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
I regret it now.

417
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,400
Now, you know to regret.

418
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,560
Qing, it's not that I want to nag you.

419
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,240
I initially thought that

420
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,320
you were quite witty,

421
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,400
quite clever.

422
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
Why didn't you think about the consequences

423
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,520
before you did it?

424
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,000
Let me think. Let me think.

425
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,040
How can we break the deadlock?

426
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,040
Burned yourself?

427
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,720
It's okay.

428
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:05,839
Should I give you

429
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,359
leaves again?

430
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,640
You don't have to.

431
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,400
You're not in the right condition.

432
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,440
Be careful.

433
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,839
Lin.

434
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,680
How about I go out

435
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,359
and run business for you?

436
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,359
Please spare me.

437
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,240
Just stay here.

438
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,480
Hello, Madame.

439
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,960
Ms Tian.

440
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,280
Can you stop following me?

441
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
Ms Tian,

442
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
just let me say something.

443
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I came to

444
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,000
apologize to you.

445
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm sorry.

446
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,400
It was also my fault yesterday.

447
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,000
I...

448
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,240
Also?

449
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Listening to what you said,

450
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,880
you're blaming others too?

451
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
Qin Qing, let me tell you.

452
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,640
I initially changed

453
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,840
my perception about you.

454
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
I thought that

455
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,040
you had grown up

456
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,880
and matured,

457
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,920
and that you should know what you're doing.

458
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,360
What you did for me,

459
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,840
it really did

460
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,400
move me.

461
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,040
But it never occurred to me that

462
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,960
you disappointed me

463
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,160
again yesterday.

464
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,920
Really.

465
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
It's really like what you said.

466
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,480
I don't understand you.

467
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,560
I really don't understand you.

468
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,720
I really never thought that

469
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,760
you would play this trick.

470
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry, Ms Tian.

471
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,600
Stop explaining.

472
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,080
If no one has provoked him,

473
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Lin Lin would neither

474
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,640
talk back to me,

475
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
nor would he commit

476
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,200
those sneaky acts.

477
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,840
Ms Tian.

478
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,240
After signing the contract

479
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,000
with Mo Yang,

480
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
we can finally be more at ease.

481
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,280
Right.

482
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,920
President Song.

483
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,880
President Su.

484
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,240
It's been a long time.

485
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,280
Yes.

486
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,840
Your application,

487
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I've registered for it.

488
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
How do you find it?

489
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,000
Any advice?

490
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,280
Please enlighten me.

491
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,280
Enlighten is a big word.

492
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,480
I have nothing to tell.

493
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
Your application

494
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
is indeed better than Chuang Pin Net's.

495
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,760
But,

496
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,240
this has also given us

497
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
a chance to improve.

498
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,320
For President Su to say that,

499
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,560
it's our honor.

500
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
But everything has just started.

501
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,680
There's still a long way ahead.

502
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
He has private connections with President Mo.

503
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
He must have known that

504
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,040
Zhou Fang helped us with this matter.

505
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,720
I'm scared

506
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,280
whether he'll pick on Zhou Fang

507
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
because of this.

508
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,160
He won't.

509
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,480
Zhou Fang is the talent

510
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,160
that he needs the most now.

511
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,200
He won't do that.

512
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,600
I feel more at ease.

513
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,320
We've overcome another obstacle.

514
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,400
After this,

515
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
it is the last crucial stage.

516
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,600
Welcome.

517
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Where is table number two?

518
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,720
It's there.

519
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,480
Here. Here.

520
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,880
Miss Ru Hui.

521
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm sorry.

522
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,600
I was caught up with some matters at school.

523
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,720
No problem.

524
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,480
Miss Ru Hui,

525
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,360
I asked you out for a meal today

526
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,760
not for anything else,

527
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,000
I just wanted to thank you.

528
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,680
The reference materials you gave me

529
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,320
helped me a lot.

530
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,280
Really?

531
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
As long as they helped.

532
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,000
Uhm... I'll search some for you again.

533
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
Sorry to trouble you.

534
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,000
No problem.

535
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,840
Miss Ru Hui, there is

536
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,120
a lot

537
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,560
that I can learn from you.

538
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Here you go again.

539
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
What's there to learn?

540
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,520
You've been learning too much.

541
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
From now on, let's

542
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,360
meet up and have fun

543
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,040
more often.

544
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,800
Let's meet more often. We have to.

545
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,640
Look, Miss Ru Hui,

546
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,720
[Qin Qing: Auntie, I've arrived.]
we really get along very well.

547
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,960
We have the same taste in food,

548
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,720
we talk about the same topics.

549
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,320
When I first got to know you,

550
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,880
I felt that

551
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,240
the two us

552
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,480
were like old friends.

553
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
Me too. Me too.

554
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,240
I really...

555
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
It's from the bottom of my heart,

556
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,320
not just to flatter.

557
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,040
It's also from the bottom of my heart.

558
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,560
That's great.

559
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,800
This is near your school, isn't it?

560
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,040
This is near your school.

561
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,480
Yes.

562
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,320
Such a good environment.

563
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,120
Really?

564
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Look at these.

565
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
The trees outside.

566
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,400
Who is this?

567
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,600
Why does she look so familiar?

568
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,240
Look at that person.

569
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,160
That's Qin!

570
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,600
What kind of coincidence?

571
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
She's here?

572
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
Why is this kid...

573
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,680
This girl, Qin Qing...

574
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,000
During our trip,

575
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
I felt that she was very passionate.

576
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,760
She's a very good girl.

577
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,920
I really like her.

578
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,640
Here!

579
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,840
Auntie Li, Ms Tian.

580
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,640
Why are you here?

581
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,760
I...I passed by.

582
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
Have you eaten?

583
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,920
I haven't.

584
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Nice.

585
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,160
Come. Sit and eat together.

586
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,960
Let's eat together. Here.

587
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,160
Sit down.

588
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
Hurry up.

589
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,160
Hurry, hurry.

590
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,280
Waitress,

591
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
Waitress, give us another set of utensils.

592
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,440
Sure.

593
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
All these are the food

594
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,120
Ms Tian likes to eat.

595
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,800
Try them.

596
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,080
We were talking about you just now

597
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,280
that you're so passionate,

598
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,440
you're so good.

599
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
Tell me why your skin

600
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,080
is so good.

601
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,120
So fair and rosy.

602
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,680
What a lovable girl.

603
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
I'll eat then.

604
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,920
Try it. Hurry and try it.

605
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,360
Here.

606
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,920
What happened?

607
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Don't force yourself if you don't like it.

608
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
You can order something else.

609
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,880
No, no. I like it.

610
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,080
It's delicious.

611
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,280
You like it?

612
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,560
Have more. Have more.

613
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,680
Don't just eat the meatballs.

614
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Have some prawns. Here.

615
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,040
I... I need to use the washroom.

616
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,720
What's up with this girl?

617
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,120
Qin wanted to send you.

618
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,040
Why did you refuse?

619
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm asking you a question.

620
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,160
What are you thinking about?

621
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,320
From the start,

622
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,480
I felt the atmosphere was weird

623
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
between you and Qin.

624
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,160
I keep feeling that

625
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720
she is purposely

626
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,920
clinging onto you.

627
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
What's the relationship

628
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
between you two?

629
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,920
If you don't want to tell me,

630
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,040
don't say it. Don't say it.

631
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,320
No, Miss Ru Hui.

632
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000
I really don't see you

633
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,760
as an outsider.

634
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,440
But...

635
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
I don't know

636
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,000
how to tell you.

637
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
Recently, this girl

638
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
has been troubling me,

639
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,960
you know?

640
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,280
I'm so troubled.

641
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Do you have plans tonight?

642
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,800
No.

643
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,640
Come to my house.

644
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,800
Have a visit.

645
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,600
After that,

646
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,000
we can chat. How good it is.

647
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,240
Okay.

648
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's go.

649
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,720
Let's go.

650
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Are you here to keep me company

651
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,520
or play chess?

652
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,360
Of course, it's to keep you company.

653
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,240
No matter how busy I am,

654
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,080
I need to keep you company.

655
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,040
I can't slack off.

656
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,120
This is how you keep me company?

657
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
I'm talking to you.

658
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,080
This is how you keep me company?

659
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,040
Uhm... No...

660
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,120
Last time, when I played chess with your dad,

661
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,600
I couldn't solve this composition.

662
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
We are visiting him again in two days.

663
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,760
I need to solve it soon

664
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,520
or else, I'll be stuck again.

665
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,840
You promised my dad?

666
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,400
When did you exchange numbers?

667
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,560
It's easy

668
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,200
to build friendship

669
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,880
between men.

670
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,760
The problem isn't with my dad,

671
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,080
the problem is with my mom.

672
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,960
We'll handle them one by one.

673
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,760
Don't think too much.

674
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,120
You're so tired from work

675
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,800
and still, you have to

676
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
figure out how to convince my parents.

677
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,680
I feel tired for you.

678
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,080
It's okay. I'm not tired.

679
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm the beneficiary in the end anyway.

680
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,200
Right?

681
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
After chatting with you,

682
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,000
I lost my train of thought.

683
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
Let me help you.

684
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,880
Can you understand?

685
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,760
I can't understand.

686
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,200
But I can mess it up.

687
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,720
Behind your back?

688
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,360
Ms Tian,

689
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,320
have some fruit.

690
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,360
Thank you. Thank you.

691
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,920
Okay. You two go on.

692
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Sure.

693
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,440
Behind your back,

694
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,120
they registered for marriage?

695
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,600
Set that aside for now.

696
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm now wondering

697
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
why they were

698
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,320
so anxious

699
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,520
to get married?

700
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
Is there another reason behind that?

701
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,800
You remember, right?

702
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,520
During our trip,

703
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,000
Qin Qing was fine before,

704
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,120
but she threw up all of a sudden.

705
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,760
And when we had dinner,

706
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,560
it happened again.

707
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,200
Is she pregnant?

708
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,280
Is it possible?

709
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,720
Now that you said it, I feel...

710
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,080
Indeed,

711
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,720
on that day,

712
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,160
she didn't seem to have any appetite.

713
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
She seemed nauseated.

714
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,520
When she saw the dishes, she felt that the dishes

715
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,280
smelled weird.

716
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Isn't that how it feels like

717
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
when one's pregnant?

718
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,880
When I was pregnant with my daughter,

719
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,920
that was how I felt.

720
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,480
Now that you said it,

721
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,040
when I was pregnant with my son,

722
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,000
I was also like that.

723
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,080
Everything is connected now.

724
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,200
They registered covertly

725
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,920
which has something to do with this.

726
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,880
No wonder our Lin Lin

727
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,360
has been acting so weird these days.

728
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
He has never

729
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,680
talked back to me.

730
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,400
If we put it that way,

731
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,200
it might really be the case.

732
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,400
That may not be the case either.

733
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,040
Then...

734
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,280
Why didn't they

735
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
just tell me directly?

736
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,720
Yeah. Why don't they

737
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,560
tell you directly?

738
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah.

739
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,560
Is it because you usually

740
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,080
call the shots for everything?

741
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,080
You usually

742
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,360
make the decisions for everything?

743
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,960
Of course. I'm his mother.

744
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,560
I have to be more concerned,

745
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,200
so that he can face less trouble.

746
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,840
Yes, yes.

747
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
All parents are like this.

748
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,280
We want them to face less trouble.

749
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
But when you think about it sometimes,

750
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,840
the good intention that

751
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,920
we have towards them,

752
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,440
they might accept everything

753
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,360
on the surface,

754
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,440
but they might not appreciate it.

755
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,840
They think that

756
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,280
we're just being autocratic.

757
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,440
As time passes,

758
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,360
they refuse

759
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,120
to talk to us.

760
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,080
They stop telling us

761
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,000
about anything.

762
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,720
If...

763
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,320
They really told you

764
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,760
about this matter honestly,

765
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,960
how would you have reacted?

766
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,600
Then...Then, I wouldn't know

767
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,560
what to do either.

768
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,640
President Su.

769
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,040
Please have a seat.

770
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,480
About the matter with Song Lin's financing,

771
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm sure you know.

772
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,840
Yes, I know.

773
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,800
About me recommending

774
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,960
the application to President Mo,

775
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,680
I'm sure President Su has known it

776
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,120
as well.

777
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,280
Yes, I know.

778
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
But don't worry.

779
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,400
I understand why you did it.

780
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,240
I just want to tell you,

781
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,880
In business, there are no

782
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,400
permanent friends

783
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
or permanent enemies,

784
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,000
there are only permanent interests.

785
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,120
I've tried

786
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,560
Song Lin's application.

787
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,520
Indeed,

788
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,120
the experience is better than ours.

789
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,400
I can't overlook it.

790
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,080
Chuang Pin Net is

791
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,360
in the process of debugging.

792
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,320
I believe we will

793
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,360
get better in the future.

794
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,920
Let's hope so.

795
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,000
TKY Shop

796
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,240
has good online sales.

797
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,120
It should have boosted

798
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,000
your haute couture line.

799
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,840
The experience store's business

800
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,200
is fully operating now.

801
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,240
I've interviewed a few designers.

802
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm preparing to sign on

803
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,120
a few designers and clothing patterns.

804
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,480
Not bad.

805
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,360
You're now

806
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,560
a popular designer.

807
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,840
That's not it.

808
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,520
We're just

809
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,960
trying to get the ball rolling now.

810
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,080
This is all thanks to your help

811
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,200
and my team.

812
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,000
They've worked really hard.

813
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
Please don't say that

814
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,880
and don't be humble.

815
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
The fact that customers chose you

816
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
explains everything.

817
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,000
But your growth is

818
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,600
indeed much faster than

819
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,240
what I expected.

820
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
After this,

821
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,000
any new plans?

822
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,920
After this,

823
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,720
I want to design and sort out

824
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,360
some conceptual and themed series.

825
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,520
In the future,

826
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,720
I hope my creations can

827
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,680
join an exhibition.

828
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,760
I look forward to it.

829
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,000
I believe

830
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,400
you won't let me wait for long.

831
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,240
Auntie, I'm downstairs now.

832
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,480
Go upstairs.

833
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,240
But you haven't told me

834
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,280
why Ms Tian suddenly

835
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,240
asked me to come over?

836
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,200
Where are all your guts?

837
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,080
What I did was to create

838
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,760
a chance for

839
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,880
you two to meet up and talk.

840
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,280
Be brave. Go up.

841
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,200
Let me tell you.

842
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,840
Your future mother-in-law is very cute.

843
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,680
Okay. I'll go up now.

844
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,480
Hurry. Go up.

845
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,240
All the best.

846
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
What are you so happy about?

847
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,120
Qing.

848
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,920
I heard our daughter said,

849
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Song is now

850
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
your chess mate.

851
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,920
Song's chess skills

852
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,960
are really not bad,

853
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,760
better than mine.

854
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
If he wasn't that busy,

855
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,760
I would've asked him to

856
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,680
play chess with me every day.

857
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,200
You're bribed just by

858
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
a round of chess?

859
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,800
He didn't bribe me.

860
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
One's chess style

861
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,280
is like one's character.

862
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
With a game of chess,

863
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,880
you can get to know

864
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
how the person's character is.

865
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
There's deep knowledge in it.

866
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,080
I remember

867
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,320
you said that

868
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,840
you went against the two of them.

869
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So you're admitting now

870
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,480
that you were blind?

871
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,440
Well, I'm not the only one

872
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,840
who was blind.

873
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
What do you mean by that?

874
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,520
You... You...

875
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,680
No. What did you say I was?

876
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,440
I didn't.

877
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,560
You said I was blind too.

878
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,680
I'll go and cook.

879
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
Look at yourself, old man.

880
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,400
You're getting

881
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,920
braver and braver now.

882
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,320
Coming.

883
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,720
Ms Tian.

884
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,280
Hurry. Come in.

885
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,400
Look at you. Why did you buy stuff?

886
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,160
It's a small token.

887
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,040
I asked you to come over today

888
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,640
to ask you...

889
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,760
You have to observe carefully.

890
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,800
Don't ask directly.

891
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
Or else, you might alarm her.

892
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,320
Ms Tian.

893
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,840
You're not angry anymore, right?

894
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,000
You know...

895
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Yesterday, I was overreacting a little bit.

896
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,680
My words were a bit harsh.

897
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,480
Don't take it seriously.

898
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,680
It's okay.

899
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm used to it now.

900
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,560
What I mean is

901
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,080
it's understandable that you were angry.

902
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Actually,

903
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,120
it doesn't matter how you tell me off,

904
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
as long as you don't

905
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:29,880
blame Zuo.

906
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,480
Yesterday,

907
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,240
he has apologized to me.

908
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,160
He's my son. It's no big deal.

909
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,680
That's good.

910
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,320
I saw that you were cleaning.

911
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,040
Let me help you.

912
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,000
You don't have to.

913
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,920
You don't have to.

914
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,280
It's okay.

915
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,440
I'll take it as to lose weight.

916
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,920
How can you

917
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,320
lose weight during this time?

918
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,520
You just relax.

919
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,080
I saw you were washing vegetables.

920
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,960
I'll wash the vegetables.

921
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,400
No.

922
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,480
During this time,

923
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
you can't touch cold water.

924
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
Just sit and relax.

925
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,880
Rest well.

926
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,960
You're treating me so nicely all of a sudden.

927
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm not used to it yet.

928
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,400
I see that you

929
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,040
don't look well today.

930
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,880
Am I?

931
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,840
Maybe I've been tired

932
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,480
for these few days.

933
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,639
Recently,

934
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,760
do you feel fatigued,

935
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
disgusted or nauseated?

936
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I threw up a few times.

937
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,400
Threw up?

938
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,120
Did you visit the hospital

939
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,400
and get it checked?

940
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,280
I went.

941
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,000
The doctor said it's gastric hyperacidity.

942
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
I'm taking medicine now.

943
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,520
Gastric hyperacidity.

944
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,600
Are you sure?

945
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm sure.

946
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,719
It's nothing. Please don't worry.

947
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,920
She said that gastric reflux

948
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
led to the vomiting.

949
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,720
Do you think I can trust her?

950
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,880
I can't tell for sure.

951
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,320
No...

952
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,520
Why would she lie to you?

953
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,320
I am wondering

954
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,360
whether they're

955
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,360
planning to have an abortion.

956
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
They can't do that.

957
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,560
The baby is innocent,

958
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,280
without doing anything wrong.

959
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,680
Exactly.

960
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,920
If

961
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,600
they hide it from me

962
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,200
and have the abortion

963
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,160
they are too irresponsible!

964
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,120
Old Tian,

965
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,160
I have to criticize you.

966
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,760
This is your fault.

967
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,640
It's your fault

968
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,640
that you were so adamant by then.

969
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,160
You were against them being together.

970
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
Qin Qing might think that

971
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,600
the situation is already

972
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,520
so hard now,

973
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,120
how will they handle the future?

974
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,800
What will they do having a baby?

975
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,040
Am I right?

976
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,600
I'll call her now.

977
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,400
Hello, Ms Tian?

978
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,880
Gynecology, 2 p.m.

979
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,560
Qin Qing,

980
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,160
don't do anything rash!

981
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,280
Ms Tian, what are you saying?

982
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,400
I have something urgent.

983
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,480
Come to my house.

984
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,160
But I'm at the hospital now.

985
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,640
I just made a doctor's appointment.

986
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,920
No. Come to my house

987
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
right now.

988
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Hurry.

989
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,520
Okay.

990
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,320
What...What happened?

991
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,840
Miss Ru Hui, I'll go back home first.

992
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,720
I'll go now.

993
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,760
Okay, okay.

994
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,080
Hurry.

995
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,200
Walk slowly! Slowly!

996
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,000
Thank you.

997
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,880
You're welcome.

998
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,800
The number of registered users has increased

999
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,200
significantly.

1000
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,440
Keep up the good work.

1001
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
Chen, why are you so gloomy?

1002
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,440
Have you not got the contract signed?

1003
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,320
It have been signed.

1004
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
If so, why are you unhappy?

1005
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,400
In order to compete with Su Yu Shan,

1006
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,040
President Song

1007
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
increased a few conditions.

1008
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,760
There's no other way.

1009
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,000
Both platforms are

1010
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,760
very influential.

1011
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,920
Only by obtaining more resources

1012
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,960
to market and promote,

1013
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
we can achieve a better result.

1014
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,840
Let me tell you good news.

1015
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
Our registered users are

1016
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,440
increasing significantly.

1017
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,000
That's good.

1018
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,680
Let's hope we can overtake Bai Sai soon.

1019
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,560
Hello, Mom?

1020
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,720
Now?

1021
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,480
Sweetheart.

1022
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,880
It's okay. Don't get nervous.

1023
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,440
You're making me nervous.

1024
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
Ms Tian.

1025
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,920
You were so anxious

1026
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,720
to call us back.

1027
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,880
Is there anything?

1028
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,080
Exactly, Mom.

1029
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,200
There's a lot of work

1030
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
for me to handle in the company.

1031
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,480
Just get to the point.

1032
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,480
You two rushed to

1033
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,680
register to get married.

1034
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,200
Is it because...

1035
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,920
Because you have it(baby).

1036
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,160
Have it?

1037
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,600
Are you okay?

1038
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,480
What do you mean by "have it"?

1039
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,400
Even until now,

1040
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
you still want to pretend?

1041
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,040
Tell me honestly, are you pregnant?

1042
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,320
Pregnant?

1043
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,560
Ms Tian,

1044
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,720
do you misunderstand?

1045
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,920
Is it because I keep throwing up

1046
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,440
that you...

1047
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,400
It's really a gastric problem.

1048
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,680
Lin Lin. You tell me.

1049
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,480
She's pregnant.

1050
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,880
Getting pregnant is such a big matter.

1051
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1052
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,960
No, I didn't.

1053
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,600
Mom.

1054
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,960
Qin Qing.

1055
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
Since Mom already guessed it right,

1056
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,400
let's just admit it.

1057
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,760
Mom.

1058
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,080
Qin Qing is indeed pregnant.

1059
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,800
Enough.

1060
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,320
He admitted it.

1061
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
What else is there for you to hide?

1062
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,440
Ms Tian, I really...

1063
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,160
Actually, Mom,

1064
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,680
Qin Qing wanted to tell you

1065
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,440
a long time ago.

1066
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,720
But she feels that

1067
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,760
you have always been against

1068
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,440
our relationship.

1069
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,040
What if you dislike her more

1070
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,240
because of this?

1071
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,720
So...

1072
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,360
I thought to

1073
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,720
get the marriage certificate first

1074
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,960
and

1075
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,920
be responsible for Qin Qing,

1076
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,480
and then come back to coax you.

1077
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,280
I never thought things

1078
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,520
would end up like this.

1079
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,080
We don't know

1080
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,880
what to do either.

1081
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,800
So,

1082
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,120
you two wanted to

1083
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,360
give up the baby?

1084
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,160
Do you have any

1085
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,120
sense of responsibility?

1086
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,920
Mom, we never wanted to give up.

1087
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,440
But I can't let Qin Qing be

1088
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,480
an unwed mother.

1089
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,000
Who's asking her to be an unwed mother?

1090
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,040
Am I

1091
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,280
an unreasonable person?

1092
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,080
So, you mean

1093
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,760
you agree with us to be together?

1094
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,000
I told you before,

1095
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
I'm not

1096
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,240
an unreasonable parent.

1097
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,600
If you two have anything,

1098
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
you can talk to me,

1099
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
you can discuss with me.

1100
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,720
You two kept misunderstanding me,

1101
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,920
that's why it led to

1102
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,320
this kind of an unnecessary mess.

1103
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,880
Yes, yes.

1104
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,840
I told you.

1105
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,440
My mom is very reasonable.

1106
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,680
Mom.

1107
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,760
We know we did wrong.

1108
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,280
Fine.

1109
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Since we've talked this through,

1110
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,400
I know what to do.

1111
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,920
You take care of yourself.

1112
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,400
Don't overthink it.

1113
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,160
Mom, don't worry.

1114
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
Let go of me.

1115
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,120
My mom has already agreed.

1116
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,880
Why are you still unhappy?

1117
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,280
What's the point of being happy now?

1118
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,320
There's nothing

1119
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,280
in my tummy.

1120
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,560
After some time,

1121
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,440
your mom will find out.

1122
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,320
When that happens,

1123
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,160
what should we do?

1124
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,040
Before she finds out,

1125
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,960
let's work hard.

1126
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,200
Do you think it's easy

1127
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,880
to get pregnant?

1128
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,680
I keep training every day,

1129
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,600
I'm very fit.

1130
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,240
No problem.

1131
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,480
But I haven't decided

1132
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,600
whether I have a kid.

1133
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,640
What do you think we should do?

1134
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
Anyways, we've already

1135
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
put it out there.

1136
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,280
It all depends on you now.

1137
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,840
Trick.

1138
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm doing this for

1139
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,720
our future,

1140
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,320
Sweetheart.

1141
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,120
If I don't value

1142
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,440
my relationship with Zuo Yu Lin,

1143
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,840
why would I put so much effort

1144
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,800
and torture myself?

1145
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,040
We've considered carefully

1146
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,440
about our future.

1147
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,440
We are neither acting on impulse,

1148
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,760
nor for fun.
