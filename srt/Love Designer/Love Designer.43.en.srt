First of all, as I said just now,

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,040
I might have to disappoint you.

95
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,200

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,800

What have you eaten?

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,040
You...

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,400
You... You're eating this?

111
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,960

You can't eat these.

You're pregnant now.

118

119
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Fine, fine.

120

Remember.

124
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,760
Next time, no matter how badly you want to eat it,

125
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
you can't eat this

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,320
unhygienic stuff.

127
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
Do you understand?

128
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,440
By the way, that...

129
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,120
Have you sent the cat away?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
Ms Tian.

131
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm not pregnant.

132
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,200
What?

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,760
I'm not pregnant.

134
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
Not pregnant?

135
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
I see.

136
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
So you two

137
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,480
were lying to me to get married?

138

it won't change anything.

141

143

You really have not changed.

144

145

Ms Tian.

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,919
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Why did you lie to me?

148

Lin Lin.

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,160
Ever since you were small,

150
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,240
you have been an honest child.

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,640
You've never lied.

152
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,000
What happen to you now?

153
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,560
Because of Qin Qing,

154
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,200
you even learned to lie.

This matter is

157
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,880
really not Qin Qing's fault.

158
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,960
It's my idea.

159
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
She didn't agree with it initially.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,520
I forced her to

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,280
lie with me.

162
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,400
You're planning to

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,720

164

Making fun of me?

166

No, Mom.

167
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,320
I know I was wrong.

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,440
Please cool down.

169
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,120
I'll be frank with you.

170
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,040
You've been badly influenced by her.

171
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,280
Break up instantly.

172
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,880

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,240
we're a legal couple.

177
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
She is my wife,

178
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,640
your daughter-in-law.

179
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,800
Can we just

180
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
sit down and talk it through?

181
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,880
This matter is my fault.

182
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,520
I will never

183
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
do this kind of things again.

184
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Can you stop asking us to break up?

185
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,560
Besides,

186
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,520
it won't be a break-up now,

187
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,720
it'll be a divorce.

188
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,480
So what if it's a divorce?

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
In case you will regret it.

190
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,160
Mom.

191
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Since I was small, you've taught me that

192
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,840
a man has to be accountable,

193
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,760
and responsible.

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
I have to be responsible

195
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,160
for my marriage and relationship.

196
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,160
Go and reflect

197
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
on your actions.

198
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
Hello, Miss Ru Hui?

199
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,120
Tomorrow?

200
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,000
Tomorrow...

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm available tomorrow. I'm available.

202
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,440
Okay.

203
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

204
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,440
You don't look good.

205
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,920
Haven't you slept well?

206
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,040
No, no.

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
It's all because of my son.

208
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,080
Miss Ru Hui,

209
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,360
I feel embarrassed just to talk about it.

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,840
My son...

211
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,760
In order to

212
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,400
marry that girl, Qin Qing,

213
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,440
he lied to me that she was pregnant.

214
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,160
Now that they've already registered,

215
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,480
they said it was fake.

216
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,920
How can I be happy?

217
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,120
They might

218
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,280
really love each other.

219
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,040
Let's not break up a couple.

220
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,240
The two of them

221
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,480
are not from the same world.

222
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,520
How can they be a couple?

223
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
From their personalities to
their family backgrounds,

224
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,680
they don't match at all.

225
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
They'll break up sooner or later anyway.

226
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,280
Isn't it more troublesome to break up later?

227
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm doing this for his own good.

228
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Our children have their own lives.

229
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,480
We can't keep worrying about them.

230
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,400
Lin Lin's dad passed away early.

231
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,840
When he was small,

232
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
I had to work

233
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,880
and took care of him.

234
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,520
I worried a lot.

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Finally,

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
I managed to raise him up.

237
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,600
Luckily, he is hardworking and brilliant.

238
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,880
But,

239
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,680
this relationship,

240
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
this marriage

241
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,240
is just a mess.

242
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,960
All parents are like this.

243
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,080
Once we have kids,

244
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,120
all our attention

245
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
are paid to kids,

246
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,520
as if nothing in the world

247
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,640
is more important than our kids.

248
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,880
But they don't understand these.

249
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
They don't know about these.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's like they think

251
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
I want to harm them.

252
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,160
If you think about it,

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,280
we as mothers,

254
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,880
we...

255
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,920
what kind of life

256
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
we wish our kids to have?

257
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,080
Very simple.

258
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,360
We just wish them

259
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
to be safe and sound,

260
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,280
have everything go smoothly,

261
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
be happy.

262
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,760
Exactly.

263
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,440
Now, he has met

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,560
someone he likes,

265
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,200
he feels very happy,

266
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,400
very blessed.

267
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,800
If we

268
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,280
force them to break up,

269
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
not only would they be sad,

270
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,520
but they would also hate

271
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,640
us forever.

272
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,120
What do you think?

273
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,000
President Song,

274
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
the number of orders

275
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,800
isn't increasing.

276
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Although a lot of people

277
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,960
saw our promotion

278
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,160
and registered,

279
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,000
the final results

280
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,200
have only generated

281
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
very little profit.

282
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,160
If this situation

283
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,120
continues,

284
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,840
it'll be hard to

285
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
maintain a good operating condition.

286
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,640
Plus, if we

287
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,160
depend on the financing solely,

288
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080
we'll be in a passive position in the future.

289
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,280
A great number of users,

290
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,680
but fewer turnover.

291
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
That means our users are

292
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
all sitting on the fence.

293
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,080
After all, our APP

294
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,400
is in a new form.

295
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,680
In regards to this new mode,

296
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,080
this new form,

297
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
everyone needs time to get used to it.

298
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,920
It's normal.

299
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,760
Because of the data leakage

300
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
at Su Yu Shan's side,

301
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
we are

302
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,840
negatively impacted as well.

303
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,520
The users' distrust

304
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,840
is understandable.

305
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,760
But for us,

306
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,560
the revitalization

307
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,760
of the users is a problem.

308
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,960
After all, we've spent

309
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,200
so much money on promotion.

310
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,640
The final conversation rate

311
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,720
needs to be boosted

312
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,520
somehow.

313
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,680
I think in terms of the hardware,

314
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,760
we don't have to worry.

315
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,080
But to customize clothes

316
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,880
and design clothes,

317
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,200
we can't depend on the hardware alone.

318
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,200
How many good shops,

319
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,920
how many appealing designers

320
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,240
does our platform

321
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,840
actually have?

322
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,560
This is

323
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,640
the focus and key for now.

324
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,640
True.

325
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,560
You are right.

326
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,440
The designer's

327
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,320
and shop's own value

328
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,640
is very important.

329
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,640
I know what to do now.

330
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,840
President Song, I'll go out first.

331
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,160
Okay.

332
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,320
The problems pending to be solved

333
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
are just too many.

334
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,000
I received a notification today.

335
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,920
The loan we applied for

336
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,280
our Hainan property

337
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,160
hasn't been approved.

338
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,600
The information leakage problem

339
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,200
has currently

340
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,000
led to a series of

341
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,960
chain reactions.

342
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,280
President Su,

343
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,000
the walls are now

344
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,840
closing in on us.

345
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,600
Problems need to solve one step at a time.

346
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,320
No point to be anxious.

347
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,680
President Su...

348
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,240
President Su, your guest is here.

349
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,640
Please come in.

350
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
I'll leave you to your work. I'll excuse myself.

351
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,160
President Su.

352
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
President Qian. President Qian.

353
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,480
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

354
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,400
Please sit.

355
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,520
It's my honor that President Su

356
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
looks for me this time.

357
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,480
Can I know why

358
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,240
you look for me?

359
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
I would like to ask for a favor.

360
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,320
Please don't put it that way.

361
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm just a small

362
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,520
tech company.

363
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,480
What favor can I do for you?

364
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,760
I heard that you're developing

365
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,320
the AR system for clothes fitting as well?

366
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

367
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,440
But we can't compare with you.

368
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
What about comparing with Song Lin?

369
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,320
Them?

370
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,800
They're just a bunch of youngsters.

371
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
But the results they have now

372
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
are pretty rare.

373
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,200
You must have heard

374
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,080
about Chuang Pin Net's issue.

375
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,600
Yes, I have.

376
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,760
The tech company

377
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
that you collaborated with,

378
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,920
I know them as well.

379
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,080
Technology-wise, they're the top in the country.

380
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,760
I never expected this to happen.

381
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,600
Someone must have been paid under the table.

382
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,160
It's a malicious attack.

383
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,680
No.

384
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
But this wasn't done by me.

385
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,480
I would never dare to.

386
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
President Qian,

387
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,360
how has your career been developing?

388
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,480
It's hard to do business nowadays.

389
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,880
I've been doing financing recently.

390
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
It costs a lot to work on

391
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,120
the technology platform.

392
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,880
I can help you

393
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,120
increase your valuation.

394
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
For President Su to say this,

395
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,240
there must be a condition.

396
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,280
Look.

397
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,520
Chuang Pin Net's online customization

398
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
is having problems.

399
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,920
Fixing the problem,

400
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,000
increasing the security barrier

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,839
will take time.

402
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,440
Besides, I'm busy with other stuff as well.

403
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,040
In the competition of the internet,
every second counts.

404
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,960
You know it.

405
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
I realized that currently,

406
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,200
Song Lin's application

407
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,680
seems to lack a rival.

408
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,200
You mean...

409
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,440
I don't want to give up.

410
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,400
How about things after you

411
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,480
finish fixing your problem?

412
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,360
Don't worry.

413
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,240
I'll make it worth your while.

414
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,320
President Su.

415
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
Your platform

416
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,200
was attacked by hackers.

417
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,680
A tooth for a tooth.

418
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
At the moment,

419
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,080
the one that needs to be counterbalanced the most

420
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,800
is Song Lin.

421
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,280
This

422
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,920
is my forte.

423
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,880
Dear Ms Tian,

424
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,560
I'm really sorry.

425
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,800
I don't know

426
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,880
how to express

427
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,600
my heartfelt

428
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,760
apologies and regret.

429
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
This massage chair

430
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
is a gift for you.

431
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,640
I hope you will like it.

432
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,960
You're already tired from teaching.

433
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,720
Now, you're even angered by me.

434
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,400
When you have time,

435
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,880
please relax.

436
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,240
Normally,

437
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,320
you live alone.

438
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,000
You have to treat yourself better.

439
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,240
Your naughty student,

440
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,360
Qin Qing.

441
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,320
Darling,

442
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,480
your cooking skills are

443
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,240
really improving.

444
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,400
If you like it,

445
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,240
I'll cook it for you at any time.

446
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Ms Tian.

447
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,800
Mom.

448
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,760
Why? You've eaten?

449
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,320
Recently, he has been so busy

450
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,600
that he kept missing his meals.

451
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,960
So I brought some food for him.

452
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,040
Mom.

453
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
Qin Qing's cooking skill is getting better.

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,040
She always brings me good food.

455
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,480
Fine then.

456
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
I have work at school.

457
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,040
I'll go back first.

458
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
Mom, let me send you back.

459
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,280
It's okay.

460
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,480
I'll just take the bus.

461
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,520
Ms Tian.

462
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,120
I have time today.

463
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,200
Let me send you back.

464
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,240
It's okay.

465
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I'm working on a product series

466
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,960
called Memory.

467
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,480
I want to go back to school to have a look.

468
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Let me send you back.

469
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,040
Is that okay?

470
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,600
Let's go.

471
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,000
All the best.

472
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,560
Okay.

473
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,120
Hello, Madam.

474
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,000
Ms Tian.

475
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,680
Next time, if there's anything

476
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,600
you need my help,

477
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,120
just let me know.

478
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm not that busy.

479
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,200
I can come at any time.

480
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Are you looking for trouble?

481
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,320
-What are you doing?
-Let go!

482
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,960
Don't make me hit you!

483
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,600
Do you know who is

484
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,160
my big brother?

485
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,800
I don't care who he is!

486
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,040
I dare you to pull it again.

487
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,840
Do it!

488
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,920
What are you doing?

489
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,520
Which class are you from?

490
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,120
Who are you?

491
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm the head teacher of

492
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,000
Class 3, Grade 10.

493
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,800
Why? I can't discipline you?

494
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,840
From Grade 10.

495
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,360
Sorry, Madam.

496
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm from Class 8, Grade 12.

497
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,480
Theoretically,

498
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,160
you can't discipline us.

499
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,160
-Can't discipline?
-How dare you speak like that?

500
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,400
How dare you speak like that
to your teacher?

501
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,560
Has no one taught you

502
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,840
to respect your teachers before?

503
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,400
Who are you?

504
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,480
I'm your senior.

505
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,040
Who's your big brother?

506
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,640
Palace of Culture?

507
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,400
Challenging for a fight?

508
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,960
Go!

509
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,640
Class 8, Grade 12, right?

510
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,680
I know

511
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,400
your head teacher.

512
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,320
Go. Let's go find him.

513
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,840
Enough. Enough.

514
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,680
Enough.

515
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,600
You all are Grade 12 now.

516
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,720
You're going to graduate

517
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,240
and step into the society soon.

518
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,080
You still think you are kids?

519
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,280
Fighting? Is it fun?

520
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
To get even, to save face,

521
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
getting yourself beaten.

522
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,440
Is it worthy?

523
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,520
In the future, when you face a situation,

524
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,360
think about the consequences.

525
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,760
Don't solve everything

526
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,040
with violence.

527
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
Use your brain.

528
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,320
Think with your brain.

529
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
Understand?

530
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,160
Still want to fight?

531
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,920
Not fighting.

532
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,480
Let me tell you.

533
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,160
This time,

534
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,520
I won't report you all.

535
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,680
But next time,

536
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
if a similar situation happens again,

537
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,360
I won't hold back.

538
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
Okay. Get going.

539
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,760
Thank you, Madam.

540
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,400
-Thank you, Madam.
-Thank you, Madam.

541
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's go.

542
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,560
-Goodbye, Madam.
-Let's go.

543
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,840
Madam, I...

544
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,560
Let's go. Go. Hurry.

545
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,400
The kids now are really...

546
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,400
Ms Tian, you're still the same,

547
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
without any change at all.

548
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,840
But from another perspective,

549
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,800
I can tell

550
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
it's hard being a teacher.

551
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,720
These kids are hard to lecture.

552
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,600
They could deviate from the right path easily.

553
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,320
Nowadays, kids are

554
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,680
too stressed out with their studies.

555
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,200
They always want to find

556
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,960
an outlet

557
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,200
to vent.

558
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,160
If you don't keep a close eye, even for a day,

559
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,280
anything

560
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,640
can happen.

561
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,640
They are in the rebellious period after all.

562
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,920
I went through it too.

563
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,000
If they don't go through it,

564
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
they will never understand

565
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,280
and never mature.

566
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,320
They keep thinking that

567
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,840
it's only called youth if it hurts.

568
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Ms Tian, now that you said it,

569
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,960
I'm feeling a bit ashamed of myself.

570
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,800
Back then,

571
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
not only did I not listen to you,

572
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,200
but also,

573
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
I always dragged you down

574
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,800
to get punished with me.

575
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,040
Ms Tian,

576
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,960
If I reflect

577
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,120
and apologize to you now,

578
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,160
is it too late?

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Fine.

580
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,840
Those are all in the past.

581
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,880
It has passed.

582
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,720
In the future,

583
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,440
be obedient.

584
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,160
Everything I do is for you two.

585
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,200
Don't think that

586
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
I'm doing you wrong.

587
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,520
I know what you have done

588
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,400
is for our own good.

589
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,320
Ms Tian.

590
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,960
You said 'in the future' just now.

591
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,800
Does that mean you've accepted me?

592
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,680
Ms Tian.

593
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,240
I'm really thankful that

594
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,360
you're willing to forgive me.

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,040
But

596
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,920
I'd still like to

597
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
apologize to you formally.

598
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,600
I lied to you about pregnancy.

599
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,680
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

600
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,480
I will be filial to you.

601
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,960
Okay.

602
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
If you really want to be filial to me,

603
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,960
prepare to get pregnant from now.

604
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,320
You're 28.

605
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,040
You're not young anymore.

606
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
If you don't give birth now,

607
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,680
when do you plan to give birth?

608
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,800
Sweetheart, why are you here?

609
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,960
Ms Tian...

610
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,760
What did my mom do now?

611
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,560
Ms Tian has forgiven us.

612
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,280
What?

613
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Ms Tian has forgiven us.

614
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,040
You're my husband from now on.

615
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,440
Then you're my wife.

616
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,400
Of course.

617
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm getting dizzy.

618
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,400
Come here.

619
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
So pretty.

620
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
Do you like it?

621
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,680
Come here.

622
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Look.

623
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,720
You made these dishes?

624
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,520
Of course.

625
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,640
I made them

626
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,600
by your recipe.

627
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,040
Sit.

628
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,680
Thank you.

629
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,280
For preparing so much for me.

630
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,920
Don't mention it.

631
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,280
Recently, we

632
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,400
haven't had time to date.

633
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,560
I don't know what

634
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,280
I can do at home

635
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,000
to make it more romantic.

636
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
Just make do and try to feel it.

637
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
Just make do?

638
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,960
You're too thoughtful.

639
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,600
Wu San.

640
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,000
Tell me.

641
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,440
Is it always like this

642
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,480
after getting married?

643
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,680
Although days can be a bit bland,

644
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,320
we're still pretty happy.

645
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,280
After getting married?

646
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,480
It's after we got married.

647
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
If I got married to someone else,

648
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
I'd be digging my own grave.

649
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,960
Being together with you

650
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
is my blessing and happiness.

651
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,040
Open it and have a look.

652
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,600
You finished it.

653
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,120
It's Coco.

654
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,680
Do you still remember

655
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,880
the first time you sent me home?

656
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,600
Coco suddenly ran out.

657
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
After that, I got the chance to

658
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,920
muster up my courage

659
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,880
and ask for your phone number.

660
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,720
There's an airplane on top.

661
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,560
It signifies our soon-to-happen

662
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
wedding trip.

663
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
This is the one and only.

664
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
Is it very meaningful?

665
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,360
Yes, it is.

666
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
I didn't get to

667
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,600
prepare a surprise for you.

668
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,240
I don't need surprises.

669
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
I just need you.

670
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,280
Wu San.

671
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,840
Before I knew you,

672
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,800
I never had thought of

673
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
settling down.

674
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
But it's different now.

675
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,760
Whether to play with my cat and
watch a movie at home,

676
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,880
or to travel around the world,

677
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
as long as you're by my side,

678
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,200
everything is meaningful.

679
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,280
Sweetheart.

680
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,080
Give me your hand.

700

701
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,360
Enough. You've already shown it off 800 times.

702
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,440
Aren't you tired?

703
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,680
That's different.

704
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,400
Last time, I was only trying it on.

705
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,080
It was only a ring.

706
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,520
Now, it's love.

707
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,720
It's an essence of the passionate, pure,

708
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,760
crystal clear love

709
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
of Wu Shan and me.

710
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,440
So dazzling.

711
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,360
Ever since you got together with Wu San,

712
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,720
you've become cornier.

713
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,640
So what?

714
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,240
Envious?

715
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,680
Envious?

716
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,800
Aren't you going for

717
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,400
a honeymoon trip?

718
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,480
Why are you still here?

719
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,200
Yeah.

720
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,280
I haven't done the itinerary.

721
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,360
Help me think.

722
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,440
Where should we go?

723
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,480
You're asking me to help you think?

724
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,360
You've already been to

725
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,320
30 to 40 countries now.

726
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,560
In the five continents and four oceans,

727
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,520
is there any place that

728
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,200
still interests you?

729
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,600
None.

730
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,040
But this is our

731
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,200
first trip.

732
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,800
I think

733
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,600
it doesn't matter where you are going.

734
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,600
Wu San...

735
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,920
As long as he's with you,

736
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,800
he sees that you're happy,

737
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,720
he'll be happy.

738
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
That's true.

739
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,080
Wu San dotes on me a lot.

740
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,800
He says yes to everything I say.

741
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,520
No matter how bad my mood is,

742
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,200
he'll tolerate and understand me.

743
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
Wu San is so pitiful.

744
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,520
He's not pitiful, okay?

745
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,160
He's happy about that.

746
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,080
Hurry and help me think

747
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,240
where to travel.

748
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't think of anything.

749
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
Actually, you two don't have to

750
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,360
travel anywhere. Just find

751
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
a hotel with

752
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,200
a good view.

753
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,880
What are you doing?

754
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
You spat on my mouth.

755
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,280
You even spat on my face.

756
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,920
Why did you go so hard?

757
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,280
When did I go so hard?

758
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,880
You...

759
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,840
You come back!

760
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,840
Review here again.

761
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,000
And the data here.

762
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,680
Xiao Fei.

763
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,160
What's the situation now?

764
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,520
By monitoring the data,

765
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,240
we've found similar

766
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,040
internal accounts

767
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,720
that alerted the security

768
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,440
when they signed in.

769
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,800
The other party used the loophole

770
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,360
and other

771
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,480
polymorphic and deformed

772
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
malicious codes in their attack

773
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
to destroy the safety barrier

774
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
and crack the authority to access the database.

775
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,040
So, even if

776
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,600
we've set up

777
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,840
a deep defence beforehand,

778
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
it still wouldn't help?

779
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,560
Hacker attacks just need

780
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,280
to be successful once,

781
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,440
but security defence needs

782
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
to be successful every day.

783
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,280
With our current technology,

784
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,240
to achieve an all-round and

785
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,480
effective monitoring and interception,

786
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,040
it's a bit hard.

787
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,080
Then do we have

788
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,320
any good countermeasures now?

789
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,000
I've already launched

790
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,920
the blacklist strategy.

791
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,320
Once we find

792
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,120
any account that

793
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,880
connects the interface

794
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,800
for more than 500 times in a minute,

795
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,880
it'll be blacklisted immediately.

796
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,560
We'll trace the corresponding

797
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,200
IP address.

798
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,160
This way, not only

799
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,360
can we blacklist at the level of the users,

800
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,680
but also for the source IP address,

801
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
we can limit it as well.

802
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Have you ever thought that

803
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,040
there's a high possibility that

804
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
the IP address

805
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,200
the hacker revealed could be fake?

806
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,240
So we need to divide the team

807
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,200
into two groups to work.

808
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,280
One group for coding,

809
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,560
to speed up the launch of the blacklist mechanism.

810
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,360
The other group will trace

811
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,520
those fake IP addresses.

812
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,720
When the true

813
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,520
IP address is located,

814
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
we can then counter-attack

815
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,440
their server.

816
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,360
This is

817
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,400
a difficult task.

818
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,680
We're counting on you

819
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,280
and the team.

820
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,440
It's our job.

821
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Review here again.

822
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,960
How's everything?

823
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,680
President Song.

824
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,960
We're still working on it.

825
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,760
Make sure you rest.

826
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,720
Don't worry, President Song.

827
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,120
We're used to it.

828
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,240
Our job works this way.

829
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,040
Stop staring at it. Take shifts.

830
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,440
You can't monitor it alone.

831
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,480
Okay.

832
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,360
President Song, you should go back.

833
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,120
We are here.

834
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,840
I'll keep you all company.

835
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,480
Don't bother about me.

836
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,560
Coffee is here.

837
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,040
You've worked hard, Xiao Fei.

838
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Pass them to everyone.

839
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Sure. Thanks, Miss Fang.

840
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:10,920
You're welcome.

841
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,320
Aren't you together

842
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,960
with Qin Qing?

843
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,240
She's getting mushy

844
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,080
with Wu San outside.

845
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,040
Getting mushy again?

846
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,440
Are you tired?

847
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,040
Catch some fresh air with me.

848
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,640
Sure.

849
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,800
Let's go.

850
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,200
Slowly.

851
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,480
The noodles you ordered are so delicious.

852
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,960
How about I come and

853
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,040
bring food over every day?

854
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,360
Wu San.

855
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,000
After you finish the noodles,

856
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,320
why don't you grab some sleep?

857
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,680
You've stayed up for nights now.

858
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
Lin, the hacker is back.

859
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,520
Go.

860
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,280
What's going on?

861
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,400
You got scared?

862
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,080
You've never experienced this before, right?

863
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,880
It is a bit scary.

864
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,760
Even at your busiest,

865
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
it wasn't like this, right?

866
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,199
Being busy is one thing.

867
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,360
my work

868
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,520
won't face so many problems.

869
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,639
Their work is a matter of

870
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,320
life and death

871
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,560
every minute.

872
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,080
Previously, I kept blaming Wu San for

873
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,159
not spending enough time with me.

874
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,080
I kept complaining.

875
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,840
Looking at it now,

876
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,239
he must have done his best.

877
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,520
Isn't it so?

878
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,159
If you never

879
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,199
see it with your own eyes,

880
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,800
you would never believe that

881
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,480
there are still

882
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,920
wars like this in this world.

883
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,880
It's as if two people

884
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,920
are climbing a mountain

885
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,159
without

886
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,159
the climbing rope.

887
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,920
Every step they take

888
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,560
has to be

889
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
towards the peak of the mountain.

890
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,520
Forget about giving up,

891
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,840
even if they just want to rest,

892
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,480
they might fall off the mountain

893
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,960
into pieces.

894
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,200
It sounds scary.

895
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,120
Is it too late

896
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,040
to change jobs?

897
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
My pitiful little Wu San.

898
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,360
He's so young

899
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,600
but he has to shoulder so much.

900
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,460
[Working?]

901
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,380
[Song Lin: The hacker issue hasn't been done.
Tonight, we might work overtime. Don't come over.]

902
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,920
Xiao Fei.

903
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,000
Xiao Fei.

904
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,880
How about taking a nap on the sofa

905
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,720
for a while?

906
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,440
What time is it?

907
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,200
3:30 a.m.

908
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
It's time to change the shift.

909
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,920
Let them sleep for a while.

910
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,720
I'll keep an eye.

911
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,840
Have some coffee to refresh yourself.

912
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,800
I'll go and see how it's going with Lin.

913
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,440
Sure. Thanks.

914
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,480
Thanks.

915
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
Why don't you rest for a while?

916
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,440
I'm here.

917
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,720
I'm okay.

918
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
You must be tired.

919
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm used to it.

920
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,760
Let me tell you.

921
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,120
After this, it's possible that

922
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,720
for a long period,

923
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,080
we'll be working at this pace.

924
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,600
Is it worth it?

925
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,960
Yes.

926
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,080
Of course, it's worth it.

927
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,040
I don't want you to lose.

928
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,320
Su Yu Shan's current situation

929
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,920
is probably his worst crisis

930
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
for the past 10 years.

931
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,040
Who knows

932
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,000
when he might fall?

933
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,160
As long as we work hard,

934
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
in the field of online customization,

935
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,040
we can be the best.

936
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,840
No matter what,

937
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,000
health is the most important.

938
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,640
If you're tired, tell me.

939
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,960
Your health goes first, okay?

940
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I'll get back to work then.

941
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,200
Go ahead.

942
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,820
[Ms Tian]

943
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,200
Hello?

944
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,160
Ms Tian.

945
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
What? Do a health screening at the hospital?

946
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,160
Overall,

947
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,520
there is nothing serious.

948
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,000
Your physical fitness is average.

949
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Your health is a bit suboptimal.

950
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,760
But this is

951
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,480
a common situation

952
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,520
for young people nowadays,

953
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,040
since the air quality is bad,

954
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,080
their biological clock is irregular,

955
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,320
and they care less about a healthy diet.

956
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,600
Would these make it harder

957
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,680
for her to get pregnant?

958
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,560
That's not the case.

959
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,000
But it's still better to

960
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,280
take care of your health normally.

961
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,920
Exercise more.

962
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,160
Have a healthy diet.

963
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,480
Take more microelements,

964
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,320
folic acid and protein.

965
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,120
Have you heard it?

966
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,480
Doctor,

967
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
is there anything else

968
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
to pay attention to?

969
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,360
This ovulation test report,

970
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,960
take it back

971
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,880
and have a good look at it.

972
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,520
You have to know about the ovulating period.

973
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,200
Let the sperm fuse with the egg cell

974
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,520
when they're at their most vital.

975
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,800
Only then you can

976
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,840
get pregnant sooner.

977
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,480
Sure, sure. Thank you.

978
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,400
You're welcome.

979
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,680
-That's all.
-Okay. Thank you.

980
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,600
We'll get going then.

981
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,280
Wish you good luck.

982
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,720
Let's go.

983
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,680
Have you remembered

984
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,720
what the doctor said?

985
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,600
Yes, I have.

986
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,840
At this time,

987
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,120
if I don't let you work,

988
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,520
it's too unpractical.

989
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
But when you're at work,

990
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,400
you have to open the window
to get some fresh air.

991
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,440
Don't eat takeouts from now on.

992
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,040
Starting from today,

993
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,320
I'll bring food for you every day.

994
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,200
And another thing,

995
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
go back home early after work.

996
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,480
The doctor has said

997
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,360
you need to exercise more and be more active.

998
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,080
Don't always eat out

999
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,960
with your friends

1000
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,800
after work.

1001
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
The restaurants outside

1002
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,520
are not hygienic. Understand?

1003
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,400
Hello?

1004
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,400
Qing.

1005
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,440
My mom asked you to have a meal

1006
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,200
at our house tonight.

1007
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,880
Can you make it?

1008
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,360
I don't know

1009
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,240
whether I can go.

1010
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,440
You're busy?

1011
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,680
I'll ask Ms Tian.

1012
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,280
What happened to you?

1013
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,600
I have no choice.

1014
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,160
I'll ask her.

1015
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,160
I'll get back

1016
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,800
to you later.

1017
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,360
Yes, yes. I know.

1018
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,200
We're now

1019
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,280
solving the problem.

1020
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,880
I'll let you know when there's news.

1021
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,760
How is it?

1022
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,800
The number of ID's sending malicious request

1023
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,640
is increasing.

1024
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,320
There's no better solution now.

1025
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
We can only troubleshoot one by one.

1026
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,160
What about the true ID

1027
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,960
that we found before?

1028
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,760
We're counter-attacking

1029
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,440
their server.

1030
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,280
If their server is down,

1031
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,120
we will win.

1032
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,360
I found another one.

1033
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,520
Hello?

1034
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,120
I know.

1035
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,000
We've worked so hard

1036
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,120
to deal with it.

1037
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,080
Give me some time, okay?

1038
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,560
Zuo.

1039
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
Now, the internet ghostwriters

1040
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,200
are scarier than hackers.

1041
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,240
Deleting the posts alone

1042
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,920
