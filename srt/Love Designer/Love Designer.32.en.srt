176
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
But don't worry,

177
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
I'll

178
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,120
make some good food for you during my free time.

179
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,360
And I'll only leave after you finish them.

180
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,960
Leave?

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,400
Why are you leaving?

182
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm going back home.

183
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,960
You're not leaving.

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Wu San, don't leave.

185
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,520
Stay here, okay?

186
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,440
Just live here, okay?

187
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
Wu San, don't leave.

188
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,480
Stay here with you?

189
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,039
Okay?

190
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,240
Brother.

191
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,080
Brother.

192
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,040
Brother, brother.

193
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,680
You woke up already?

194
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
I just fell asleep.

195
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,600
Don't sit on the floor, it's cold.

196
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,280
Come up and sleep.

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,640
Come up and sleep.

198
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
I can't, my legs went numb.

199
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,040
Here, I got you.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,520
Be careful.

201
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,560
My legs are too numb.

202
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
Stop, stop moving.

203
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
Zhou Fang, where are you?

204
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
I'll die if you don't come now.

205
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,160
It's not a big deal.

206
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
You're away from the subject.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
How could you talk like an unconcerned person?

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,240
Come here, right now.

209
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm on my way, relax.

210
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,520
I'll be there soon.

211
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,120
Master,

212
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,640
should we rest for a while?

213
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,440
No, pretty.

214
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,480
Master,

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,600
how much did he pay?

216
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,240
I'll give you a double.

217
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,640
That's great if you're going to pay double.

218
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Hey...

219
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,680
Thank you, master.

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,520
Wu San,

221
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
yesterday I was drunk and talking nonsense.

222
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
I know.

223
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,840
You're telling the truth after you get drunk.

224
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,400
You tricked me.

225
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,520
The tricked is real, and the heart is real too.

226
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,760
Have you

227
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,680
had breakfast?

228
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
The kitchen can't be used now.

229
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,040
I'll give you some

230
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
snacks from Bestore.

231
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
Why isn't shehere yet?

232
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,840
Your favourite mixed nuts.

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm not hungry.

234
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,480
Stop.

235
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,120
I'll call the police

236
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,040
if you don't stop it now.

237
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,680
Police?

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,080
What took you so long?

239
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
Help me, scold him.

240
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,760
He's crazy.

241
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
Are you two playing?

242
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,760
Miss Fang.

243
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,560
I live here every day,

244
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,680
it's no difference from cohabitation.

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,880
It's different.

246
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
It's so much different.

247
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,480
I wouldn't agree on cohabitation.

248
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
I strongly disagree.

249
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,920
I need a private space.

250
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,200
I'll give you space.

251
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,560
Don't worry, even if I move in,

252
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
it wouldn't affect

253
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,160
your life.

254
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,800
Say something.

255
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,640
Wu San, I think in this case,

256
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,960
it's good for you two to live together.

257
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,760
You're a traitor.

258
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,640
So are we going to continue?

259
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,560
-No.
-Yes.

260
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,040
Zhou Fang, how about you?

261
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,160
Qin Qing, you've been defeated, just agree on it.

262
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
Move it, faster. We're running out of time.

263
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Come, faster, move it.

264
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,120
Thank you, Miss Fang.

265
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
I'll help too.

266
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,280
Why are you

267
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,560
doing this to me?

268
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,680
Ling Xi, come here.

269
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not easy to meet up.

270
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240
I've ordered a cup of coffee for you.

271
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,640
It's because of Huo Chen Dong,

272
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,560
he keeps persuading me,

273
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,280
otherwise, I wouldn't be here today.

274
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
If you're going to apologize

275
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,320
for that day,

276
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm sorry

277
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,120
but I've made my decision.

278
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,400
I guess so.

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,760
You have your principles,

280
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,160
right?

281
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,040
Huo Chen Dong

282
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,520
has told me so.

283
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,840
He asked me to apologize.

284
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,160
I was too rushed to leave that day.

285
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,080
It's too bad.

286
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
And I think

287
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,520
you shouldn't

288
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,480
listen to him.

289
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,240
Something that can't be forgiven

290
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,040
will still not be forgiven.

291
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,960
It's no use to apologize.

292
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,800
Why?

293
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,600
If one's

294
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,520
views and opinions

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
can be easily changed

296
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,760
by others,

297
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,320
you're being irresponsible

298
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,280
for yourself.

299
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,400
You are right.

300
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,800
So...

301
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
I think

302
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,640
that's all for today.

303
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,240
No, no.

304
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm here

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,400
for another thing.

306
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,840
I want to talk about

307
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
the painting.

308
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,360
Have a seat.

309
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,400
I think

310
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
for that painting,

311
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,880
if you really want to take it back,

312
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
it's no use

313
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,440
to argue

314
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,800
for that.

315
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,840
The more you argue with him,

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040
the more he thinks this painting

317
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,840
is important to you.

318
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,360
Since it's important to you,

319
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,600
he will not let go.

320
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
And I saw

321
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,880
a lot of paintings in the exhibition that day,

322
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,680
only that one

323
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,440
is not for sale.

324
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
I really want to know

325
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,560
what the special meaning

326
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,160
it has for you.

327
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,320
It's worthless.

328
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
Worthless?

329
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,320
Worthless...

330
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,760
I think Lin Yun

331
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
should have drawn

332
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,240
a lot of paintings of you.

333
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
But why

334
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,200
is there only one left

335
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,320
in the exhibition?

336
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,520
You got it wrong.

337
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,280
He has only once

338
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,760
drawn a painting of me.

339
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,240
Let me tell you

340
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,800
a story.

341
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,400
At the beginning,

342
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,000
I was just like

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,920
what you did that day.

344
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,840
I felt that love was priceless,

345
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,680
and it was worth paying for.

346
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,600
Even if it was a precious opportunity.

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,720
But in the end,

348
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,840
it turned out

349
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,360
it had been a farce.

350
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,800
Love is different from person to person.

351
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,920
I think my feelings

352
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,440
are very reliable.

353
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,760
Your girlfriend named Zhou Fang, right?

354
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,880
She works for Su Yu Shan's company.

355
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,840
She has a bright future ahead of her.

356
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,400
Besides,

357
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,080
she is

358
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,040
one of the most potential designers.

359
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,440
You did a thorough background check

360
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,200
on me.

361
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,240
But you've given up

362
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,000
such a precious opportunity for her,

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,319
aren't you afraid that

364
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,200
it might affect your future career?

365
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,240
My share sale

366
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,160
has nothing to do

367
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,480
with my future career.

368
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,240
So I'm not afraid.

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,720
You must have enough money

370
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,120
to make a comeback.

371
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,280
If you don't have enough money,

372
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,280
you will end up

373
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,760
in a complete loss.

374
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,800
That's way too far.

375
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,960
A complete loss

376
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,760
are way too far from me.

377
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,120
Without the financial support

378
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
of selling the shares,

379
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
it is impossible for you

380
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
to recreate the miracle of Wan Feng Group

381
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
by yourself.

382
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,960
By contrast,

383
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
Zhou Fang

384
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,320
will go further

385
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
and even wider.

386
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,320
By that time, the gaps between you two

387
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,160
will only get bigger.

388
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,120
Isn't that great?

389
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,080
Song Lin.

390
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,320
Why are you here?

391
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,280
I was just passing by.

392
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
Let me introduce.

393
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
This is the share agent

394
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,120
of the buyer, Ling Xi.

395
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,240
This is my girlfriend, Zhou Fang.

396
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,480
Hi, Ling Xi.

397
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,600
It seems like you've recovered.

398
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,080
Zhou Fang,

399
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
I think

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
I've made it clear.

401
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,160
That's the end of our deal.

402
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Goodbye.

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
Don't worry.

404
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Our company's shares

405
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,520
is now highly sought after.

406
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
Several companies are competing for it.

407
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,160
I'm still choosing.

408
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,360
I'll choose the most suitable one.

409
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
So you're not telling me these

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,880
because you're afraid that I might worry?

411
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,640
So I no longer

412
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
have the rights to listen to?

413
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,480
No.

414
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,600
You were in

415
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,920
such an emergency,

416
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,080
suddenly being hospitalized.

417
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,680
I didn't see you when I came back.

418
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,720
So there's no time to tell you either.

419
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Stop worrying about these.

420
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
But the two people together

421
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,280
meant to

422
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
share and care for each other, right?

423
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm always the one

424
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,040
you take care of.

425
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,960
I don't think it's fair.

426
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,400
I thought it wouldn't be a problem.

427
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,360
It can be solved.

428
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,400
That's why I didn't tell you.

429
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,880
I don't want you to worry about me.

430
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Do you understand?

431
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,480
What about now?

432
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,480
Can you tell me now?

433
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,680
Although I might not

434
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,360
have enough money

435
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,160
to help,

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,080
at least I could be

437
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,000
a good listener,

438
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,600
listening to

439
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,760
my boyfriend's worries and problems.

440
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll tell you if you want to know.

441
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,200
I want to know.

442
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,360
What a mess.

443
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,760
What?

444
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,920
Are you still angry?

445
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,920
Yeah.

446
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,120
I was just about

447
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,840
to throw out all your things.

448
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,880
Throw them then,

449
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,200
as long as you're happy.

450
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,520
Just throw them.
I'll buy new ones.

451
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,400
Oh, right.

452
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,640
My mother called me today

453
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,320
and said there was
something urgent at home.

454
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
She asked me to come home.

455
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,880
That's alright.

456
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,800
Darling,

457
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,120
you've been so busy lately

458
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,320
that you haven't had time

459
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,080
to meet your family.

460
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Why don't

461
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,000
you spend time with them?

462
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,240
You don't have to come over tonight.

463
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
You're my family too.

464
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,720
Just stay home and wait for me.

465
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,520
I'll be back when I'm done.

466
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,800
Lin,

467
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,720
these are all made by Mum

468
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,200
according to the recipe

469
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,360
left by your dad.

470
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,440
It's all your favourite.

471
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,560
Eat more.

472
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,000
Mum,

473
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,400
your students

474
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
have come to visit you again.

475
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,480
In a blink of an eye,

476
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,000
they've become parents.

477
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,080
You're no longer young,

478
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,720
you have to hurry up as well.

479
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
Mum, you asked me to come home.

480
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,320
Is there anything important

481
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,880
to tell me?

482
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
Isn't it important to come back

483
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,400
and eat with Mum?

484
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
I'm sorry, Mum.

485
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,840
I've been so busy lately

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,440
and didn't come home often.

487
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,400
It's a good thing to be valued.

488
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,440
But you should alsolearn how to balance

489
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,320
work and rest while striving for success.

490
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,480
Work and life are

491
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,040
mutually reinforcing.

492
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,160
Yes.

493
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,960
When will you

494
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,960
bring your girlfriend

495
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
to me?

496
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,520
Soon.

497
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,280
Okay.

498
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,760
Mum, your occupational disease has returned.

499
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,040
You treat me as your student,

500
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,920
trying to get something from me.

501
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,040
Anyway, you have promised me.

502
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
No, I don't even have a girlfriend.

503
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,120
Where do I

504
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
find a girlfriend?

505
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,120
Look.

506
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,920
You're playing dumb with me.

507
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,880
I took a screen shot this time,

508
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,680
who will it be if it wasn't you?

509
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,360
Mum,

510
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,200
do you think

511
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,360
this boy looks like me?

512
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,080
What do you mean by that?

513
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,440
It's definitely you.

514
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,080
I've even zoomed in to see.

515
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,840
Look.

516
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,080
My colleagues thought it was me,

517
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,440
they thought that I've got a girlfriend.

518
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,640
I found this picture

519
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,000
quite interesting

520
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,600
on the Internet.

521
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,240
So I post it to my social media.

522
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,640
Really?

523
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,800
But why would I think

524
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,760
this girl actually look familiar?

525
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,200
Mum, stop kidding.

526
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
How could it be possible?

527
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,720
So, you're not seeing anyone?

528
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,200
No.

529
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,560
I'm busy with my work.

530
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,640
I don't have time for that.

531
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,480
Mum,

532
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,400
here,

533
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,400
eat this, eat more.

534
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,640
This is so delicious.

535
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,360
Eat more then.

536
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,720
You two,

537
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,920
what does it mean?

538
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Aren't you two leaving?

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,080
You're a traitor.

540
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
Miss Qing said she's going to kill you.

541
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
She asked me to come for help.

542
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
Let's make it clear, Zhou Fang,

543
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,080
you are responsible for this.

544
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,120
From now on,

545
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm going to live here.

546
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,880
You have to provide me with food,

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
clothes and room.

548
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
I'll leave

549
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,160
when Wu San leaves.

550
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,240
Don't do that.

551
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,200
So, it seems like

552
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,080
you two are officially together.

553
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,960
Not bad.

554
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
No, have you ever seen me

555
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
cohabiting

556
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,840
with my boyfriend?

557
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,760
Never.

558
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,520
But living together is good

559
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,680
in terms of balanced out

560
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,280
habits and personality.

561
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,000
It's easier to

562
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,240
explore each other's flaws.

563
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,400
Think about it.

564
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,480
Two people living together,

565
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,000
they will have to deal with

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,880
trivial things.

567
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,600
It is inevitable for

568
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,640
unnecessary contradictions.

569
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,440
By that time,

570
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
we would end up in

571
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,360
breaking up.

572
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,520
So,

573
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,360
you're not afraid of cohabiting

574
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,040
but breaking up.

575
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,040
Which means

576
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,760
you really care about him.

577
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,080
That's how it is.

578
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,160
Zhou Fang.

579
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,320
Okay.

580
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
We're having

581
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,280
the same kind of confusion.

582
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,640
You're thinking about

583
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
cohabiting with Wu San,

584
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,520
and I'm thinking about Song Lin.

585
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,120
What happened?

586
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,240
I thought you two were fine.

587
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,440
I've just got to know that

588
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
while I was being hospitalized,

589
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,400
he gave up

590
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
the negotiation with the buyer,

591
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
so that he could

592
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,360
come back to see me.

593
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,720
and he offended the agent.

594
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,720
So,

595
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,480
the deal didn't work out.

596
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,040
It seems like

597
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,800
he's quite infatuated.

598
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,080
I should do something

599
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,400
to help him

600
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,360
get the agent back.

601
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,920
Shen Pei Pei,

602
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,800
do you know the one named Lin Yun

603
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,120
who's holding a painting exhibition?

604
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,880
Yes, I know.

605
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,240
Could you get me

606
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
his details?

607
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
The more detailed, the better.

608
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,080
And most importantly,

609
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,240
you must find out the information

610
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,080
between him

611
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
and his ex-girlfriend, Ling Xi.

612
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,520
As I heard from Song Lin today

613
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
about things that happened

614
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,400
in the painting exhibition,

615
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,040
I think his ex-girlfriend

616
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,520
are pretty important

617
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
to Lin Yun.

618
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,560
No problem, I got this.

619
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,400
Now you know

620
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,320
how important I am.

621
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,080
You are always

622
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,840
important to me.

623
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,320
When it's done,

624
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
both of you have my treat.

625
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,920
Deal.

626
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Right,

627
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,840
don't tell Song Lin

628
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
about it.

629
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,160
Keep it a secret for me.

630
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,760
Sure.

631
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Got it.

632
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
You are here.

633
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,640
I have been looking for you.

634
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,960
You are back.

635
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,160
What are you doing?

636
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,600
Make the bed.

637
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,200
I'm ready to sleep.

638
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,960
I have a meeting

639
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,640
tomorrow morning.

640
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,880
Sleep here?

641
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,360
Or what?

642
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,680
So that's how you see

643
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,760
cohabitation?

644
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,080
It was you

645
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,200
who said

646
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,840
there's no personal space

647
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,360
if two people stick together.

648
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,600
So I'm giving you space.

649
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,880
We shouldn't let such a big house

650
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,080
go wasted, right?

651
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,240
Alright, goodnight.

652
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,760
Oh, right, you said your mum looked for you?

653
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,000
Is there anything important?

654
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
She just wanted to see me.

655
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,440
She asked me

656
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,240
to go back for lunch.

657
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,240
Goodnight.

658
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,400
Goodnight.

659
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,520
Just text me if there's anything.

660
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,920
What are you doing?

661
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,440
Why are you still awake at this hour?

662
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,640
I'm doing some online shopping on Vipshop.

663
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,400
I want to buy something for you.

664
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
I'm afraid that you might have no time

665
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
to buy new clothes.

666
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
I'll get it ready for you.

667
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,360
So sweet of you.

668
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,520
I've seen this brand

669
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,560
in the mall.

670
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,280
It's quite expensive.

671
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,400
Does that mean you want me to buy for you?

672
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,800
Well, you may understand it

673
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,560
in that way.

674
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,840
Just buy it.

675
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,400
Vipshop has more discounts

676
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,320
than the mall.

677
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,560
I'll buy anything for you.

678
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,240
You're so generous.

679
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,400
Luo Luo.

680
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,840
Take care of yourself

681
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,120
when you get there.

682
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,680
Don't worry.

683
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,960
Shen Di will be there with me.

684
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,080
Although both of you

685
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,520
are no longer a kid,

686
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,160
but still are a teenager.

687
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,480
if you want to develop further,

688
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,640
it's better to wait

689
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,600
until you go

690
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,520
to college.

691
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,920
Never mind, we shall talk about it later.

692
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,040
I understand.

693
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,880
I've told you

694
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,720
last time,

695
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,480
we are just

696
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,400
friends.

697
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,080
You were just like my brother,

698
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,800
who likes to think a lot.

699
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,160
I didn't go abroad for him.

700
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,800
To be honest,

701
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,400
you and my brother

702
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,760
have gone through a lot,

703
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,600
even if you are having problems

704
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,760
or conflicts in the future,

705
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,880
don't ever break up

706
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,920
like you did last time.

707
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,640
Why suddenly speaking of this?

708
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,560
Like an aunty.

709
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,560
I'm serious.

710
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,640
I know.

711
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,200
You two should stay good together.

712
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,680
Do you hear me?

713
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,400
Please take good care of

714
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
my brother.

715
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,720
Let's sleep now.

716
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm sleeping with my sister-in-law.

717
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,520
Morning.

718
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,080
Morning.

719
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,040
Eat.

720
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I'm so busy

721
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,680
that I forgot

722
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,240
my birthday.

723
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,880
Oh, right,

724
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,600
thank you for the present,

725
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,840
I like it so much.

726
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,640
It's nothing.

727
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,120
I'm glad that you like it.

728
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,200
Let's eat.

729
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Okay.

730
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
Shall we

731
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,760
go out for dinner?

732
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,239
Do you have time?

733
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,560
Yes.

734
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,120
I got nothing left

735
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,159
but plenty of time.

736
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,239
Okay.

737
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,159
After I book the restaurant,

738
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,679
I will let you know.

739
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,239
Alright.

740
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,600
Welcome.

741
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,180
[From Shen Pei Pei: Lin Yun's Information]

742
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,560
What I want to express in this painting

743
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,240
is the image of modern society,

744
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,640
a complex and harsh living environment,

745
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,720
and

746
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,000
the living conditions of all kinds of people.

747
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,880
Mr Lin,

748
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,920
it seems that

749
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,720
you have put some thoughts into this painting.

750
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,680
It's good.

751
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,160
Hi, Mr Lin.

752
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,120
Hi.

753
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Excuse me.

754
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
Mr Lin, I would like to ask

755
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,320
that painting

756
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360
must have been painted

757
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,880
before you being known?

758
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
How do you know that?

759
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,280
I've been drawing since I was small.

760
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,240
I can feel

761
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,080
the emotion

762
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,920
from that painting.

763
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,320
And most of your paintings

764
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,920
are abstract.

765
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,120
and this is the only one

766
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,840
portrait painting.

767
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,640
The color choices are totally different

768
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,480
from other paintings.

769
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,560
It seems

770
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
simple,

771
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,240
but you did put a lot of effort into it.

772
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,000
You are right.

773
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,800
That painting

774
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,480
cost

775
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,360
me the most effort.

776
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,720
And I think this painting

777
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,840
worth a lot more

778
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,560
than others.

779
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,200
As you know that

780
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,160
it's priceless,

781
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,000
so it was marked

782
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,880
as not for sale.

783
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,840
Actually,

784
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,760
I've been paying attention to your works

785
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,920
for a long time.

786
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,280
Then you must also know that

787
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
I once wanted to give up painting.

788
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,080
Because at that time,

789
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,840
I can't even

790
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,520
support myself.

791
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,480
In order to live,

792
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,640
I went to the streets

793
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,080
to offer portrait painting service for tourists.

794
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,800
And she was

795
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,280
my first customer.

796
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,240
Why are you telling these

797
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,280
to the stranger

798
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,080
you meet for the first time?

799
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,920
It's simple.

800
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,520
Because after I became famous,

801
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,360
you were the first

802
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
to speak out

803
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,720
about the painting.

804
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,200
If that's the case,

805
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,280
why don't you

806
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,720
just give that painting

807
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,640
to the lady in the painting?

808
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,640
Did she ask you to come?

809
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,480
No.

810
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
I only met Ling Xi once,

811
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,520
we're not even friends.

812
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,280
But in fact,

813
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,920
I need her help.

814
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,040
Just like

815
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,120
the situation you were in back then.

816
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,160
I'll give her that painting

817
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,560
only when she knows

818
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,520
what that painting means to me.

819
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,960
So for now,

820
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,480
that painting is still

821
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,280
not for sale.

822
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,880
Excuse me.

823
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,120
Luo Luo.

824
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,600
Are you done?

825
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,560
Almost.

826
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,840
Take everything with you,

827
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
don't leave anything behind.

828
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,800
Call me

829
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,720
if you need anything.

830
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,440
I have everything I need.

831
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
Just don't forget to transfer the money.

832
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
You can only remember the money.

833
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,600
Hmm...

834
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,120
I've asked Qin Qing and the gang

835
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,720
to have dinner together

836
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,840
and see you off.

837
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,720
I'll pick you up later

838
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,440
with Zhou Fang.

839
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:17,920
Okay?

840
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,880
Good.

841
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,200
Don't worry about me.

842
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,200
Aren't you going to work?

843
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,080
Go to work.

844
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,120
I want to be with you for a while.

845
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,280
No, just go to work.

846
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,040
Go ahead.

847
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,360
Okay, okay. I'll get going now.

848
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,200
Take your time.

849
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,640
Now the modeling system

850
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,720
has been built.

851
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,640
The current issue

852
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
is the data collection of clothing products.

853
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,600
This requires

854
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,920
the participation of different brands

855
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,680
with a large product base

856
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,480
to cooperate with us in collecting samples.

857
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,720
As for now, several companies

858
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,320
have started

859
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,000
this project.

860
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,480
Including Bai Sai Group.

861
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,640
Like what Xiao Fei said just now,

862
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,000
Bai Sai Group

863
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,760
has more advantageous than us.

864
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,880
It wouldn't be a problem.

865
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
Now my

866
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,040
main concern is

867
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,720
information security and privacy protection.

868
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,800
I've been stressing on these aspects

869
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,720
right from the start.

870
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,440
But I've seen that

871
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,400
your upgraded system

872
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,440
is still not perfect

873
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,360
in this aspect.

874
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,280
President Song,

875
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,560
we understand what you mean.

876
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,920
However, in order to improve

877
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,240
the authenticity of garment fit effect,

878
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,760
we'll have to collect enough data

879
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,120
from the users

880
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,880
to improve accuracy.

881
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,800
I hope that after our products

882
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,920
go online,

883
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,880
it could deliver

884
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
not only the ideas of innovation and convenience,

885
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,120
but also its security and reliability to our customer.

886
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,280
Customer trust

887
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,800
is very important to us.

888
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,760
Once we lose

889
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,600
the trust of our customers,

890
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,440
all our efforts will go in vain.

891
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,000
We all know about

892
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,560
the severity of the data breaches.

893
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
So we must

894
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
solve it

895
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,480
in the shortest time.

896
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,480
President Song,

897
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
the release time

898
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
may be delayed.

899
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,560
That's not a problem.

900
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
As long as our products are good enough

901
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,120
and the details are perfect,

902
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,680
there must be a market for us.

903
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,160
I got it.

904
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,400
I want to know

905
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,360
if it keeps

906
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,400
being this way,

907
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,560
how long it can last

908
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,400
with the fund I have now?

909
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,560
