[Episode 34]

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,680
That's all. Thank you.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,120
Alright.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,960
As usual, President Su?

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,880
Yes, thank you.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,320
Okay.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,320
President Su.

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,520
This shop

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,280
belongs to you too, right?

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,720
Why did you say so?

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,080
Because the interior of the shop

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,400
as well as the furniture

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,840
are made of solid wood.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
I saw it just now.

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
It isn't a counterfeit.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,880
It's genuinely

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,520
classic furniture.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
How much coffee should be sold

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,720
to afford these?

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
Most importantly,

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
the clothes for the servers here

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
belong to your company's

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,200
restructured haute couture,

48
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,160
right?

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,039
You're really smart.

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,800
President Su.

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
The small building that

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,800
you showed to me

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,440
is really interesting.

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
I have no idea why

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
you'd keep

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,480
that area without using it.

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,040
Is it

58
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,840
for the little puppy?

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,560
Perhaps it's like what people always say.

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,760
It was a secret base.

61
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,240
Although it is

62
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,200
really a good place,

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,920
I think that

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't take it.

65
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,920
You think too much.

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
It wasn't a

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520
so-called secret base.

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,440
It was just my working place

69
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
when I was young,

70
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,600
which left a lot of beautiful memories to me.

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,280
That's why

72
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
I bought it.

73
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
Don't be stressed.

74
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,840
You are a talent.

75
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I just do whatever I can.

76
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,200
That's what I want.

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
Are you sure?

78
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,480
Yes.

79
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,120
But,

80
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
I have another condition.

81
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,440
Yes?

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,440
About the little puppy

83
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,960
you said just now,

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,760
can you take care of it

85
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
after moving in?

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,320
Why not?

87
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
Since you

88
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,760
like it so much,

89
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,000
why don't you bring it home?

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,280
My wife is afraid of dogs.

91
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,680
Where are my things?

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
They're here.

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
You're a designer.

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
Just let me

95
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,000
do these trivial things.

96
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,680
I really want to slap you now.

97
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't slap me.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,760
You asked me to consider it, right?

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,240
I've considered it. I'm not going to move.

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,200
Why?

101
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Here are my reasons.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,680
Firstly,

103
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,040
you touched my things without my permission,

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
and moved all my things

105
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
to your house.

106
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
This is a mistake.

107
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,760
Secondly,

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,200
although my mum

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
is feeling better about you,

110
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,000
you are still

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
under observation now.

112
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
Can't you

113
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
have a plan B?

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,440
Thirdly,

115
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,640
which is the most important reason,

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,720
you should know that

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,680
both of us

118
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
have never gone on a date properly.

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,640
Never?

120
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
Yes, never.

121
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,920
What's wrong?

122
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,880
You want to

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,600
simply date me,

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,280
then

125
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,920
we live together

126
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,800
in the same house?

127
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
What's the big deal?

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
Just a date, right?

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
Alright, let's get changed. Let's go on a date now.

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,960
Okay?

131
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,360
What's wrong again?

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
What a brush-off.

133
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,160
You aren't being serious at all.

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,040
Was that a brush-off?

135
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Just a date.

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
Shall I plan it out?

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,920
Of course. Please plan it out.

138
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,640
You don't join me?

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
No, I don't.

140
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
You plan it out.

141
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
Moreover, before this,

142
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
because of the case of Ling Xi and Lin Yun,

143
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
my work has been slowed down.

144
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
I need to catch up.

145
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,400
You must plan it out as soon as possible.

146
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
If not, when you get busier later,

147
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
it'll be

148
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
delayed again.

149
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,360
It seems that

150
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,720
you're looking forward to it.

151
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,800
Of course.

152
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't ever

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,680
disappoint me.

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,440
Sure.

155
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
One more thing.

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,960
Su Yu Shan brought me

157
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
to a factory.

158
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,160
I think that it's quite good.

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,440
I plan to develop it.

160
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,520
Just do it.

161
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,200
You don't have to

162
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
report this small thing to me.

163
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
Alright.

164
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Be good.

165
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm going back.

166
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
I've made an appointment with

167
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
Madam Cheng on this weekend.

168
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't forget it.

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Okay.

170
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,000
Remember

171
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,960
to move back my things.

172
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm leaving.

173
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,720
Why didn't you two

174
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
inform me before coming?

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,560
What's wrong? Are you going out?

176
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,800
What a formal dress.

177
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm going to meet a teacher.

178
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
Which teacher?

179
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
Song Lin's teacher.

180
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,920
She's a senior

181
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,640
in the field of design.

182
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,520
I have

183
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,200
a few projects recently.

184
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
So, I wish to get her opinions.

185
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
It sounds like an important thing.

186
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,200
Hurry up. Don't be late.

187
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,520
Alright. See you.

188
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm leaving.

189
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,919
Have you eaten breakfast?

190
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,360
No.

191
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,039
Hey...

192
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm making a steamed egg for you.

193
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
Take the one that I bought…

194
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
This…What's this called?

195
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
Dietary fiber.

196
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm thirsty now.

197
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,400
I'll take it.

198
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
Buy something to eat later.

199
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,760
I'm leaving.

200
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,720
Didn't you sleep well?

201
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Yes.

202
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,880
Thinking about our date?

203
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,720
No.

204
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,760
When you meet Madam Cheng later,

205
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,440
don't mention her child.

206
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,880
Madam Cheng.

207
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
Don't keep staring at Zhou Fang.

208
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,840
She's feeling embarrassed.

209
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,320
Right?

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,480
Whom shall I look at then? You?

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Look at yourself.

212
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
You have to rest often.

213
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,800
Xiao Zhou.

214
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,760
Today,

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
you look so different

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
from the one appeared on the TV.

217
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,800
Of course.

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,080
Now, there are polishing,

219
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,320
post-processing and make-up to be
done before appearing on the TV shows.

220
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,080
Of course she

221
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,000
looks different on the TV.

222
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,080
What do you mean?

223
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,240
You mean I'm not looking good?

224
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,240
No. I meant that

225
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,400
you're looking better than in the TV.

226
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
Really much better.

227
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,880
Anyway, it's boring.

228
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,520
What do you mean?

229
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
Never mind.

230
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,680
Sometimes, a man

231
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,240
says yes when he means no.

232
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
Although he said it's boring,

233
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,400
he wants to look at you

234
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,160
forever, in fact.

235
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Right, Song?

236
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,760
Yes.

237
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,080
Madam Cheng.

238
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Last time,

239
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,200
because of my illness,

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Song Lin

241
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,680
didn't go on the field trip with you.

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,360
I feel sorry about it.

243
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
Sorry.

244
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,880
Don't be silly.

245
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,440
It's fine.

246
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,880
I feel so happy

247
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,400
for Song Lin,

248
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,760
since he met someone he loves.

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,720
Go ahead with your business.

250
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
Count on me for the rest.

251
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Then, you accompany Madam Cheng.

252
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,280
Let me answer a phone call.

253
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
When you decided

254
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,360
to set up an experience store,

255
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,520
Song

256
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
asked for my opinion right away.

257
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
He supports you very much.

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
Actually,

259
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,480
he helps me a lot.

260
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,840
However,

261
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
regarding the experience store,

262
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,080
I think that

263
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,920
he cares about my feeling.

264
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
That's why he supports me.

265
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,560
He doesn't believe that

266
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
I can make it.

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,480
He's not the only one actually.

268
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,120
Based on my ability

269
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
and experience,

270
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
I doubt my performance as well.

271
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,080
We have

272
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,720
argued for a few times

273
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,840
for this matter.

274
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,000
I think that he's too realistic.

275
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,320
He thinks that

276
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm too idealistic.

277
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,720
Regarding this one…

278
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,400
I must say something.

279
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,920
Before this,

280
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,960
Song Lin

281
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
was the same as you.

282
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,560
He was an idealist.

283
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
He did many

284
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,720
unrealistic things too.

285
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Sometimes,

286
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,080
he was really childish and naïve.

287
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,640
Today, I think that

288
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,920
both of you are alike.

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,520
Okay.

290
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
Let's go over there.

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
Hopefully, you'll be inspired.

292
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,240
Okay.

293
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:17,800
Come.

294
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,280
There are some counterfeits here.

295
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,200
I obtained

296
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
some of them

297
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,080
from veteran craftsmen.

298
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,040
Madam Cheng.

299
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Isn't it a wooden loom

300
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,320
for weaving tapestry?

301
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,760
Wonderful!

302
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,000
You know it.

303
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,760
Many people

304
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,880
visited here before,

305
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,720
including the professionals and amateurs.

306
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
You're the first one

307
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,560
who noticed this wooden loom.

308
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,520
Tapestry is like

309
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,840
Hermes in silk.

310
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,720
I believe that

311
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,640
the classical craftsmanship

312
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,800
won't be replaced

313
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,760
by modern techniques.

314
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,560
Not everyone

315
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,320
appreciates inheritance.

316
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Today, many people

317
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
choose tapestry

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
as the high-class material

319
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,440
for handmade customized products,

320
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,680
because

321
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,920
it's able to reflect

322
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,520
the user's standard and taste.

323
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
However, they have no idea

324
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
about its value.

325
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
So, what's the most important thing

326
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,560
for a designer?

327
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,840
He must fill his heart with awe.

328
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
Respect history.

329
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,800
Only seek for innovation

330
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,320
through the inheritance.

331
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,520
I think,

332
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,800
the real haute couture

333
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,920
is absolutely not

334
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
a personal asset.

335
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,320
It should present in the form of a product

336
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,600
to publicize

337
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
the awareness of the value

338
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
and aesthetic sense.

339
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
Do you agree with me?

340
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,720
Absolutely, Madam Cheng.

341
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
Don't laugh at me.

342
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
When I was

343
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,040
a designer,

344
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,840
I always hoped that

345
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
the clothes I made

346
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,720
must be

347
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,680
the most precious piece

348
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
in my customer's wardrobe.

349
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,800
However, today,

350
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,880
after listening to you,

351
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
it has changed my perspective

352
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,840
of the design industry.

353
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm really lucky

354
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,240
to choose to be a designer.

355
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,160
She's my daughter, Si Yue.

356
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
Did Song Lin mention her to you?

357
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,320
Yes.

358
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,320
She's attractive.

359
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
You look like her

360
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,320
somehow.

361
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,640
When my daughter

362
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
was your age,

363
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,960
she proposed

364
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,400
to set up an experience store as well.

365
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,440
She would get it done

366
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,040
if she wasn't sick at that time.

367
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Madam Cheng.

368
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,440
How's it?

369
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,320
You learned a lot

370
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
from talking with Madam Cheng, right?

371
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
I have learned a lot.

372
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,160
Alright.

373
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
I have something to do.

374
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,880
You both enjoy.

375
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,520
Then, I will accompany her.

376
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,240
You should have brought me

377
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,000
here before,

378
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,800
I would have learned a lot.

379
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,160
I didn't have enough time

380
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,920
before this, right?

381
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,040
It's not too late now.

382
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,440
It's not too late

383
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,760
to explore and learn now.

384
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,800
What's wrong?

385
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,120
Nothing.

386
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,760
Let's go.

387
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,280
What's wrong with you?

388
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
You look different after looking at the photo.

389
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,480
Tell me.

390
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm thinking

391
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,440
about Si Yue.

392
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Nothing.

393
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,040
Here I am. You go back first.

394
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,000
I've promised my mum

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,680
I'd return home early.

396
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,640
Let's eat together.

397
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
You're so bold now.

398
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,120
You can't expect to achieve anything

399
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,320
if you never take any risks.

400
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
Please go back.

401
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,040
Are you here, Song?

402
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,160
Dad.

403
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Uncle.

404
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Great.

405
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,080
Come in.

406
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
Alright, I'm leaving now.

407
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Bye-bye.

408
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,160
Let's go, Song.

409
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,280
Me too?

410
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,040
Your aunt is waiting

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,760
to question you.

412
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,640
Question me?

413
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,000
I have something to do, Uncle.

414
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,560
I have to go back

415
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,240
to get it settled now.

416
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,880
You bear the consequences.

417
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,960
No. I'm going now, Uncle.

418
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:16,249
[Medical Report]

419
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,720
Mum.

420
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,480
I didn't mean to hide it from you all.

421
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,520
Doctors

422
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,600
said that

423
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
there was a flu outbreak last time.

424
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,920
It might be infectious.

425
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
That's why I didn't tell you.

426
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,760
Upset?

427
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,600
Aunt isn't feeling upset.

428
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,480
She just

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,320
worries about you.

430
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,560
Right, Aunt?

431
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,280
Aunt's feeling jealous.

432
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,800
Uncle. Aunt.

433
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,920
Let me explain

434
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,760
Zhou Fang's plan to you.

435
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,120
It was pretty simple.

436
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
During the flu outbreak,

437
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,440
the hospital

438
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,480
was the most dangerous zone.

439
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
She didn't inform

440
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
anyone who cares her

441
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,280
and the one that she misses.

442
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,840
She was afraid that you'd visit her. That was risky.

443
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,880
I'm different.

444
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,320
No one cares about me.

445
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,520
I'm busy all the time.

446
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,400
I tell you, Aunt.

447
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
I'd be exhausted

448
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,880
if I'm not fit enough.

449
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,319
I realize that…

450
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm not sure about

451
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,480
your strengths,

452
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,560
but you're really good at speaking.

453
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,200
You can make a lie a fact.

454
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,560
Stop teasing him, mum.

455
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,200
Did I tease him?

456
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,440
Can't I tease him?

457
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,599
You just knew him

458
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,480
for a few days.

459
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,440
He's become a family member now.

460
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,480
How about me?
I've brought you up for years.

461
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,560
You asked me to stop teasing.

462
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,920
Then, you treat me better, please.

463
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,160
Don't talk about it anymore.

464
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,760
She's fine now, right?

465
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Most importantly, she's healthy.

466
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,960
Thank you, Song.

467
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
No worries, Uncle.

468
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,360
That's what I should do.

469
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,800
Taking care of Zhou Fang every day

470
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,840
brights up my days.

471
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
I feel really happy.

472
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,800
What happiness.

473
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,120
I've promised Aunt.

474
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,920
I said I would

475
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,720
do my best

476
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,920
to prove that

477
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm the one

478
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
whom Zhou Fang could count on.

479
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,080
I'm hardworking every day.

480
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,840
I would give Zhou Fang

481
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,760
the best of everything.

482
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,840
However, I realized that

483
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,440
I couldn't make it.

484
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,360
What did you mean?

485
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,640
Aunt.

486
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,560
I realized that

487
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,720
Zhou Fang

488
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,840
is the best thing in the world.

489
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,360
Oh, my gosh!

490
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,480
I almost drop my jaws.

491
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,560
Let's cook.

492
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,520
Yes, let's cook.

493
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm going to cook, Aunt.

494
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
No, no, no. Wait.

495
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,720
Did I ask you to eat together?

496
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,440
Mum.

497
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Song Lin's cooking

498
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,200
is really good now.

499
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,440
Give him a chance

500
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
to perform.

501
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,280
Okay. Go ahead.

502
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,800
Try it.

503
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,880
I just cook. I don't eat.

504
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,760
I'll help him.

505
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,440
Okay.

506
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,440
Mum.

507
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
Mum,

508
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,680
since Luo Luo went overseas,

509
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
he's alone

510
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,680
at home every day.

511
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,640
When I was

512
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,600
admitted to hospital,

513
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,400
he looked after me

514
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
all the time.

515
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
Please give him a chance

516
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,200
because of it.

517
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay?

518
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,800
You told me the truth finally.

519
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,960
Relax now?

520
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,480
You aren't good.

521
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
Tell me.

522
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,160
if he treated you well

523
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,240
in hospital.

524
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,120
No extra bed was allowed in the hospital.

525
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,440
So, he waited for me

526
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,960
downstairs every day.

527
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,720
Then, he sent me

528
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,000
breakfast, lunch and dinner himself.

529
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,520
He made them himself.

530
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
He didn't really

531
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
know cooking before.

532
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,360
I have no idea how Luo Luo

533
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,640
ate it.

534
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,400
Song.

535
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
Zhou Fang told me that

536
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
you're transforming

537
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,080
to restart your business now.

538
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,120
Zhou Fang is an advisor of your project.

539
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,880
Yes.

540
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Uncle. Zhou Fang is really good now.

541
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,960
She's improved a lot.

542
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
Much better than me.

543
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,400
You can't say that.

544
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,640
Something

545
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,680
might seem to start from zero,

546
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,160
but

547
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,760
it's the power of accumulation.

548
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,400
You managed to

549
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,160
put the past behind you

550
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
and restart.

551
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,400
It's not easy.

552
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,360
Your expertise

553
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
and Zhou Fang's competence

554
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
complement each other.

555
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,960
Discuss more when having problems.

556
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,720
Explore and learn.

557
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,320
Understand each other better.

558
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,960
We know it, Uncle.

559
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
We can make it.

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,440
Song.

561
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,080
You know your aunt.

562
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,680
She doesn't mean to make things hard for you.

563
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Once bitten,

564
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
twice shy.

565
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,360
Don't take it to heart.

566
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,800
However,

567
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,560
what you said just now

568
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
wasn't appropriate.

569
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,960
Empty talks

570
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,920
don't work here.

571
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,720
You made a bad impression.

572
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,640
I didn't know it, Uncle.

573
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,840
Uncle.

574
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
You must help me in future.

575
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
Support me.

576
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,280
Aunt's fine.

577
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Compliment me more.

578
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,280
That's fine.

579
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,440
You should have understood

580
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,400
our family.

581
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,320
Zhou Fang listens to me.

582
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,920
Both of us

583
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,360
have to listen to your aunt.

584
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,800
Let's work hard together.

585
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,280
Got it.

586
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,340
[Timeless]

587
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,160
There are so many popular designers

588
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,240
working with you, President Su.

589
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,920
Why did you choose to help me?

590
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
Firstly, I appreciate your talent.

591
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,160
That's no doubt.

592
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,320
Moreover,

593
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,880
you look like

594
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,480
my old friend.

595
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,000
She was also

596
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,480
a talented designer

597
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
with a strong personality.

598
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,880
How's she doing now?

599
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,960
She's passed away.

600
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,400
She's my daughter, Si Yue.

601
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,360
When my daughter

602
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,280
was your age,

603
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,720
she proposed

604
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
to set up an experience store as well.

605
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,200
You look like her

606
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,120
somehow.

607
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,240
She would get it done

608
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
if she wasn't sick at that time.

609
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,980
[Timeless]

610
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,920
Come on, Uncle. Be careful.

611
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Alright.

612
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,320
Be careful, Dad.

613
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,080
It's fine.

614
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,280
It seems like a long time ago.

615
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,880
I thought

616
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,200
I wouldn't be able to return.

617
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,320
Dad.

618
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,120
What a nonsense talk.

619
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
Yes. Come, let's go.

620
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,680
Let's go.

621
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:56,960
Go.

622
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Mum.

623
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,640
Later,

624
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,760
let Zuo Yu Lin cook.

625
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
His cooking is good.

626
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,440
Okay.

627
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,000
President Zhou.

628
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,680
I'm really sorry.

629
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,680
President Su said that

630
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,200
he couldn't make it today.

631
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,400
It's fine. It's my mistake

632
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,120
for not telling him in advance.

633
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,960
So, it's urgent.

634
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,680
Let me help you

635
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,160
contact President Su.

636
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,040
No need. It's fine.

637
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
I'll contact him later.

638
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,680
-Thanks.
-OK.

639
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,360
He cooks for me

640
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,280
normally.

641
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,040
Dad, try the soup he made.

642
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,680
Come.

643
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,880
It's not bad.

644
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,720
Zuo.

645
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,160
Take a break.

646
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,880
Come and eat.

647
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm coming, Uncle.

648
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,840
How's it?

649
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,840
It tastes not bad.

650
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,440
Zuo, sit over here.

651
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,160
Zuo.

652
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,760
Thank you

653
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,120
for the effort all the time.

654
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,280
It's alright, Uncle.

655
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,160
What are you holding?

656
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,160
I have something

657
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,040
to tell Uncle and Aunt.

658
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,440
Sure.

659
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,600
Uncle. Aunt.

660
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
This is the bonus I got

661
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,360
for my project.

662
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
One-third of it

663
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,800
has been spent

664
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,680
in purchasing the shares of the company.

665
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Qin Qing's name was written

666
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,560
on the purchase letter.

667
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,160
This is my salary bank card.

668
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
This is my car key

669
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
and house key.

670
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,320
Everything will be given to Qin Qing.

671
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,960
My medical report

672
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,760
is here as well.

673
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,360
I'm really healthy.

674
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,040
My certificate of study

675
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
and my award certificates

676
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,720
are all here.

677
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
What's wrong with you?

678
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,280
Uncle. Aunt.

679
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,120
I know that I'm still young.

680
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
My background is not impressive.

681
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,080
You might think that

682
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm not the best choice

683
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
of Qin Qing.

684
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,280
It's normal

685
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,280
for you as the parents to be worried.

686
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Don't worry.

687
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,720
I'll work hard

688
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,680
to earn more.

689
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
So that Qin Qing can live well.

690
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,160
I'll make sure that she won't feel bad.

691
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,360
Although

692
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,160
there are uncertainties in future,

693
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,360
if I

694
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,520
explained it orally,

695
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,920
I was afraid that

696
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,680
you two would still be worried.

697
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,000
So, I've brought

698
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,680
everything here.

699
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,720
It's my sincerity.

700
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,600
Please trust me.

701
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
I'll treat Qin Qing well.

702
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
I'll love and care for her forever.

703
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,720
We'll be good forever.

704
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,720
Please trust me.

705
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,880
Eat.

706
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,960
Let's eat.

707
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,440
I'm so hungry. Let's eat.

708
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,320
Eat some prawns.

709
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,880
Zhou Fang.

710
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,600
I was told that you were urgently looking for me.

711
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,440
I…

712
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,160
President Su.

713
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,320
I looked for you

714
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,120
out of impulse

715
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
just now.

716
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,360
It's your

717
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
personal affair.

718
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,680
I shouldn't ask much.

719
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,080
I'm sorry.

720
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,400
Personal affair?

721
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,080
You want

722
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,000
to know more about Si Yue?

723
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,600
I saw Si Yue's photo

724
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,920
in Madam Cheng's exhibition.

725
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,040
So the small building

726
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,680
that you showed me

727
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,840
was Si Yue's studio?

728
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,800
Will the stories there in the past

729
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,840
affect your

730
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,600
career in future?

731
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
No. Not at all.

732
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,640
Sorry, I'm too emotional.

733
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,120
It's fine.

734
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
Actually,

735
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,320
nothing to be hidden.

736
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,040
Back then, we started our own business.

737
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
I was too hasty in getting achievements.

738
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
I pressured her to make new products.

739
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,680
I brought her

740
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,120
to visit all fashion shows.

741
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,800
When she was critically ill

742
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,680
in the hospital,

743
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,240
I was celebrating for

744
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,600
the new contract

745
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,360
I got outside

746
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
without being with her.

747
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
It's really a joke, isn't it?

748
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,120
Sorry.

749
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,240
Don't.

750
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,720
I should thank you.

751
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
It's my pleasure

752
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,560
to tell you

753
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,440
about the most embarrassing thing

754
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,920
in my heart.

755
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,000
Her dream

756
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,520
was to transform the studio

757
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,200
into an experience store.

758
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Please allow me

759
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,520
to realize her dream.

760
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,360
Manage your store well,

761
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,840
okay?

762
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,320
Sure.

763
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,080
Why did

764
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,960
you come here with Su Yu Shan?

765
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
I had something to talk to him.

766
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,680
Jealous?

767
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,920
Am I jealous of him?

768
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,640
How is the date tomorrow

769
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,360
going?

770
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,320
Why do you talk about our date

771
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,440
like talking about work?

772
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,320
It indirectly means that

773
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm serious

774
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,840
in the relationship with you.

775
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
Okay. You know swimming?

776
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,440
Don't know.

777
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,720
Get a lifebuoy.

778
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
Why? Go swimming tomorrow?

779
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
I'm afraid that you'll fall into the river

780
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
of love with me tomorrow.

781
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
How disgusting.

782
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,400
There is more.

783
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,880
Do you want?

784
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,720
No, please.

785
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,360
Can I cancel

786
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
tomorrow's date?

787
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,800
Sure.

788
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,520
Then, you compensate me threefold of my time lost.

789
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Is that an extortion?

790
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,240
So what if it is?

791
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm driving. Stop it.

792
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,240
Eat more, Coco.

793
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,200
Hey, dear.

794
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,520
Do you miss me

795
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
when I'm not around?

796
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,280
Of course.

797
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,240
Of course, I miss you.

798
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,400
Uncle was just discharged.

799
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,000
You should

800
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
accompany them more often.

801
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,800
You performed well today,

802
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,600
Wu San.

803
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,520
Uncle and Aunt

804
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,600
are considerate.

805
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,360
You really give me

806
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,800
the card?

807
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,960
If not?

808
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,680
It's my sincerity.

809
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,360
People always say that,

810
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,560
the place a man puts his money

811
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,520
is where he puts his heart.

812
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,160
Alright.

813
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,760
I'll take care of it for you.

814
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,040
Later,

815
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
I'll ask Chen Dong

816
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,760
to prepare you a financial analysis.

817
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,560
You should keep

818
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,560
the salary bank card.

819
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,080
I never allow

820
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,760
my man

821
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
to have no money.

822
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
You'll be looked down.

823
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,720
Who dares look down on me?

824
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,680
It'll be better

825
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,560
if you give me

826
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,080
pocket money monthly.

827
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,560
Okay.

828
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,280
Deal.

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,760
Hey.

832
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,360
What are you doing?

833
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,120
I'm doing assignments.

834
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,800
So serious.

835
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
I'm looking forward to it.

836
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,520
Sure.

837
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,680
I'll be hardworking.

838
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,680
Rest early. Good night.

839

This contract

is officially valid now.

843
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Thank you.

844
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,800
Regarding the issue last time,

845
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,520
I'd like to apologize again.

846
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,880
I'm really sorry.

847
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,440
Honestly,

848
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,640
You made

849
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,360
a bad impression

850
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,360
in our last meeting.

851
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,800
Yes.

852
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,200
If Ling Xi

853
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,480
didn't support it,

854
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,080
we wouldn't

855
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,880
make it today.

856
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes, sorry.

Thank you, Ling Xi.

858
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,760
Don't mention it.

859
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
We decided

860
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,440
to close the deal

861
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,200
because of the high return

862
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,160
of Wan Feng Group.

863
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,160
No project would go wrong

864
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,640
if it's audited by Ling Xi.

865
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,720
Really?

866
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,440
I'm flattered.

867
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,160
Okay. I hope that

868
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,280
we can have more collaborations in future.

869
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,800
Sure. Certainly.

870
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,120
Okay.

Excuse me.

Actually, you don't have to thank me.

00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,480
in my audit,

882
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,320
which was also the key

883
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,960
in closing this deal.

884
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,520
You all

885
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,480
made a wise decision this time.

886
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Wan Feng.

887
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,920
I believe that Su Yu Shan will

888
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,120
develop it better in future.

889
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
You're really generous.

890
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,640
What do you mean?

891
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,120
Why do you still allow

892
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,520
Zhou Fang to collaborate with Su Yu Shan?

893
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,240
I think that

894
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,160
it's the best opportunity for Zhou Fang.

895
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,320
I think that

896
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,480
Zhou Fang can be better.

897
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Actually, Lin Yun

898
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
is really a self-abased

899
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,320
and arrogant man.

900
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
It isn't easy

901
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
to communicate with him.

902
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,160
Zhou Fang

903
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,400
solved the painting issue for me.

904
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,120
She made me a good impression.

905
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
A good impression?

906
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,800
What impression did you have on her?

907
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,120
Her scandal

908
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,480
was reported online, right?

909
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,320
You saw it.

910
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,200
Zhou Fang

911
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,480
is really detail-oriented, right?

912
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,080
She's a kind and helpful girl.

913
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,480
She would sacrifice anything

914
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,640
to help others

915
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
without hesitation.

916
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,760
However, I think that

917
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,440
Ling Yun has acknowledged

918
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,840
Zhou Fang's aesthetic sense.

919
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,360
So, Zhou Fang's future designs

920
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,760
must be able to add values

921
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,360
to Wan Feng Group.

922
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,760
Certainly.

923
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,480
Everything's fine now.

924
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,840
What's your

925
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,880
future career plan?

926
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,120
My new company is working on

927
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,560
a technology project. You know it, right?

928
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,040
Virtual tailoring?

929
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,159
It's a new concept.

930
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,600
Why did you choose

931
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
a technology sector

932
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,159
that you are unfamiliar with?

933
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,600
I can't choose it if I'm unfamiliar with it?

934
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,040
I'll be familiar with it after doing it.

935
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,199
No, you mean that

936
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,080
it's not a good project.

937
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,679
I must understand

938
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,480
the core competency

939
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
of this project,

940
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,960
before giving the right judgement.

941
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,159
Okay. You're really an expert.

942
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,639
Are you busy?

943
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,960
Yes.

944
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,760
It's an important thing.

945
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,400
Why don't you ask me

946
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,920
since when

947
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
I knew how to ride a motorcycle?

948
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,560
Because I know that

949
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,640
you will tell me.

950
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,840
What a good ride.

951
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,000
When did you learn it?

952
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
I learned it

953
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,280
when you gifted me a car.

954
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,680
I know that

955
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,120
you like riding a motorcycle very much.

956
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,760
So, in future,

957
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
I want to do it with you.

958
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,880
You're wrong.

959
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,120
I like you the most.

960
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,560
The most?

961
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,880
Yes, the most.

962
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,400
I saw

963
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,000
an old man and his wife ride a motorcycle.

964
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,160
Although the speed was not fast

965
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
and quite slow,

966
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,480
it's pretty cool and romantic.

967
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,840
It's cool.

968
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,480
Aren't we

969
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,200
the same now?

970
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,560
Riding a motorcycle on the street.

971
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,720
We're younger than them,

972
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,760
and more energetic, right?

973
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,880
Since when did you

974
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
like riding a motorcycle?

975
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,600
When I was around seven years old.

976
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,520
So small! Why?

977
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,440
Because of my dad.

978
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,840
My dad had a dream.

979
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He wanted to be a racer.

980
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,280
So he wished to open a workshop.

981
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,480
But my mum said that

982
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
he was unrealistic,

983
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,560
asking him to

984
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,400
be more realistic.

985
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,800
My dad was upset about it.

986
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,400
He studied it every day.

987
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,200
Lastly, he used me

988
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,840
as his excuse

989
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,840
to buy a motorcycle.

990
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,880
My mum was so frustrated about it.

991
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,040
Then, after my dad

992
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
got a motorcycle,

993
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,760
he sent me to school

994
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,080
and fetched my mum off work every day.

995
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,280
My dad said,

996
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,160
people who like motorcycles

997
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,480
can stay young forever.

998
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,640
Then he said that,

999
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
the happiest moment

1000
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,240
in his life

1001
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,120
was when he fetched my mum.

1002
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,640
How romantic.

1003
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,160
I'm feeling happy too now.

1004
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,800
Want to eat meat?

1005
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,200
What a piece of meat.

1006
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,280
What was

1007
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,000
the most recent compliment

1008
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
you gave?

1009
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,560
Pretty. Cute.

1010
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,560
Fake.

1011
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,440
What are they playing?

1012
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,520
The game of life.

1013
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,160
The game of life.

1014
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,080
The game of life?

1015
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,360
It means from a relationship…

1016
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,960
From knowing each other to a relationship,

1017
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,440
followed by a marriage.

1018
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,680
Every year,

1019
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,880
one must answer his/her partner a question

1020
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,800
until they get old.

1021
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
That's a childish

1022
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,240
game, right?

1023
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,480
Not childish at all.

1024
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,560
Imagine that an 80-year-old

1025
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,680
can answer

1026
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,120
these love questions

1027
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,080
like youngsters.

1028
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,080
It's cute, isn't it?

1029
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,920
Not childish

1030
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,080
for an 80-year-old to answer these questions?

1031
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,360
Please don't.

1032
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,440
I can't take it.

1033
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,640
Three, four, five.

1034
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,560
If your partner was sick

1035
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,840
and couldn't take care of herself,

1036
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
would you take care of her?

1037
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,320
Sure, of course.

1038
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,720
If I was sick

1039
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,480
and couldn't take care of myself,

1040
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,080
would you take care of me?

1041
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,440
What illness did you get?

1042
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Don't mind the illness first.

1043
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,200
Answer me.

1044
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,360
Couldn't take care of yourself?

1045
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,920
That means you can't move at all,

1046
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,800
and I had to change your clothes

1047
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,160
and to bathe you every day?

1048
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,720
Yes.

1049
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,520
You want to marry me?

1050
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,440
Just a question.

1051
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,600
It's fine if you don't answer me.

1052
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,360
Stop going off-topic.

1053
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,360
If you didn't marry me,

1054
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
why should I bathe you?

1055
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,240
Okay. Don't answer it.

1056
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,720
Zhou Fang.

1057
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,040
Look at me.

1058
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,000
In future,

1059
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,160
I promise to be true to you

1060
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,360
in good and bad times,

1061
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,040
in sickness and in health.

1062
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,760
I will love you

1063
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,680
and be with you all the days of my life.

1064
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,040
Till death us do part.

1065
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,840
Do you want to marry me?

1066
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,720
You dream.

1067
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,840
We just started dating, right?

1068
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,680
You doubted it.

1069
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,800
I didn't.

1070
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,200
Alright. It's fine if you don't want to admit it.

1071
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
You don't admit it now.

1072
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,600
I'll ask again in future.

1073
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,640
Let's see when

1074
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,200
you'll admit it.

1075
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,800
What a shy look.

1076
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,640
I am not.

1077
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,560
Mum.

1078
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,520
You got cervical spondylopathy,

1079
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
because you were too tired.

1080
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,120
I didn't agree with your return

1081
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,760
to working.

1082
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,800
It's better to rest at home.

1083
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,400
I'm resting now. My neck is getting better.

1084
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,080
But my heart's empty.

1085
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,400
I don't wish to lose

1086
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,120
my platform.

1087
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,760
You're right.

1088
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,040
Mum, better to get busy.

1089
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,680
You're still young.

1090
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,040
Seriously?

1091
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,440
Lin Lin. Since you started working,

1092
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,360
you didn't

1093
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
return home actively.

1094
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,760
What's wrong with you today?

1095
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,640
Anything?

1096
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,680
Mum, I feel upset

1097
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,360
listening to you.

1098
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,120
I got

1099
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,000
a half-day leave today.

1100
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,080
That's why I returned home to accompany you.

1101
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,840
Where else to get

1102
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,800
such a good son?

1103
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,440
If you're good,

1104
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,120
you should bring your girlfriend home

1105
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,240
to visit me.

1106
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:19,960
Mum.

1107
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,720
I just wanted to tell you about it.

1108
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,840
She's quite busy recently.

1109
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,360
I'll bring her home

1110
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
after she finishes her tasks.

1111
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,560
Really?

1112
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,200
Tell me.

1113
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,440
What's her career?

1114
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,000
A jewellery designer.

1115
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
What a high-profile job.

1116
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,080
Yeah.

1117
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,720
She's not only talented

1118
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,280
but also low-profile.

1119
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,520
She just finished joining the exhibition,

1120
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,440
I wanted to

1121
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,600
treat her a meal to celebrate it.

1122
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,400
She didn't want it.

1123
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
She told me that working

1124
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,160
is more important than the other things.

1125
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,720
It shows that

1126
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,600
she's a humble and low profile girl.

1127
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,160
I think,

1128
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,640
she's really a good daughter.

1129
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,320
Her dad just had surgery not long ago.

1130
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,160
She worked in the morning

1131
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
and accompanied her dad at night.

1132
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,000
She took part in all kinds of work

1133
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,520
without rest.

1134
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,160
She's so hardworking.

1135
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,280
You should

1136
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,440
help her.

1137
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,200
I wish to, but she didn't allow.

1138
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,880
Why?

1139
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,160
She thinks that

1140
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,800
I'm busy too.

1141
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,880
She cares about me.

1142
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
What a good girl.

1143
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,600
Mum.

1144
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
Sometimes, I work overtime.

1145
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,680
She will make me supper.

1146
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Her cooking

1147
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,880
is not as good as yours.

1148
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,000
Be grateful.

1149
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
How many girls

1150
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,280
are willing to cook today?

1151
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,440
They will be unhappy if their boyfriends

1152
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
spend less time with them.

1153
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Be grateful.

1154
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,880
Mum.

1155
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
I haven't brought her home.

1156
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,600
You've started taking her side.

1157
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,560
I just tell the truth.

1158
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,880
However, there's something

1159
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,800
you might not be satisfied with, Mum.

1160
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,480
What's that?

1161
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,160
She's

1162
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,640
slightly older than me.

1163
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,240
What's the gap?

1164
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,520
Four years.

1165
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,880
Having a relationship with a younger person

1166
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,520
is a trend now, right?

1167
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,800
Just a few years

1168
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,040
is acceptable.

1169
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,240
Most importantly,

1170
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,360
the relationship between both of you.

1171
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,200
My mum is really open-minded.

1172
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,000
Mum.

1173
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,000
You must

1174
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,760
beat the stereotypes

1175
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,720
and judge again.

1176
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,360
Beat the stereotypes?

1177
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
What stereotypes?

1178
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm so happy

1179
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,640
that I

1180
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,400
sound incoherent.

1181
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:30,920
Mum.

1182
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,280
I cut an apple for you.

1183
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,520
You like eating apples.

1184
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,160
If you are good to me,

1185
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,120
quickly

1186
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,880
