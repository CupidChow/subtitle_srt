00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
grow up with him?

177
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,000
The problem is

178
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,400
after you grow up with him,

179
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
he becomes a matured person.

180
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,640
Does he still need you?

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,320
I just came out of your aunt's house.

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,240
Let me tell you,

183
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
they quarreled again.

184
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,080
They quarrel endlessly day after day,

185
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,160
disturbing my study every day.

186
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,000
I tell you, they...

187
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh, gosh.

188
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,600
My brother seems to drink too much.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Later,

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,120
I will talk to you.

191
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,240
Bye bye.

192
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,320
Even there are two Wang Ze Yang

193
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
and three Huo Chen Dong,

194
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,760
they can't be compared with you.

195
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,400
What are you doing, you drank alcohol?

196
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,120
Who is this?

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Are you Wu San?

198
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
He mentioned you before.

199
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,440
Stand up.

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
Are you Song Luo?

201
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,200
Lin also talked about you before.

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,680
Where is your house?

203
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll carry him back.

204
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,960
It's okay.

205
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,840
Just give him to me.

206
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
Can you?

207
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm fine, are you fine?

208
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm okay.

209
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Okay.

210
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
Don't vomit, Lin.

211
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Or else you will lose.

212
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Be safe.

213
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

214
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
What's the matter with you?

215
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,159
What are you doing with a man at night?

216
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,559
You are so troublesome.

217
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,080
Get me something to eat

218
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
when you get home.

219
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,400
I'm hungry.

220
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,080
What?

221
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
Where do I get food for you

222
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,200
at this hour?

223
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,640
Fine.

224
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,840
Come, let's go.

225
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
You want to eat something, right?

226
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
Let me bring you to eat.

227
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,600
Let's go.

228
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
Let's go.

229
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
What do you want to eat?

230
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,760
Don't vomit, don't vomit.

231
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
What do you want to eat?
Little lobster?

232
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,080
Big plate chicken?

233
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,640
Roasted naan?

234
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,520
Spicy strip.

235
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Spicy strip?

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,920
Here, here, here.

237
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,040
Your spicy strip.

238
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,920
Spicy strip.

239
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
Smell it, does it smell good?

240
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,920
Yes.

241
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,120
Come.

242
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,480
Go inside.

243
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Done!

244
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
What are you doing? Who are you?

245
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,560
What the hell are you doing?

246
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,840
Get up.

247
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Who are you?

248
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,880
You came to my house.

249
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,640
And you are asking who I am?

250
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,080
You smell so stinky. Full of alcohol smell.

251
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,720
Get up.

252
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,840
Don't touch me.

253
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,800
Get up.

254
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
Get up quickly.

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,880
Hurry up.

256
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Get up.

257
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
What do you want to do?

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,880
What do I want to do?

259
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,200
You

260
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,120
can't even know how to act cute.

261
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,200
I had enough of you.

262
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Who wants to act cute to you?

263
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,440
Get up quickly.

264
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
Go back to your own house, faster.

265
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
You stink so bad.

266
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,360
Full of alcohol smell.

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Every time I think of you, I will...

268
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,640
What's wrong with you?

269
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,200
I want to...

270
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,520
Don't vomit, don't vomit.

271
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,480
Don't vomit, swallow it.

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,560
Get up.

273
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,680
Go to the toilet to vomit.

274
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,400
Go vomit at the toilet.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,520
Why did you vomit on me?

276
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,360
Vomits are all over your clothes.

277
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,920
How many times have I said?

278
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,280
This matter really has nothing to do with me.

279
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
Whether you believe it or not,

280
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,120
this only shows that

281
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,640
my brother only cares about you.

282
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
He didn't even go back to his own house.

283
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,080
He didn't want me,

284
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,720
his biological sister.

285
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,800
Isn't this irritating?

286
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,400
Don't think about these things.

287
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,440
Hurry up and do your revision.

288
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,840
If this time you still can't

289
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,760
get into the top ten,

290
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,040
don't blame me for not helping you.

291
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't worry, I will be fine.

292
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
What are you wearing?

293
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,000
Your prank

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
is a bit too much.

295
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,520
Do you believe that I will beat you up?

296
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,080
Go home, Song Luo.

297
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,280
Don't go home.

298
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
Why go home?

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,360
Look.

300
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Zhou Fang made porridge for you.

301
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,520
What porridge. Let's go back home quickly.

302
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,960
Go over there.

303
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Come, let's eat.

304
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,520
Sit.

305
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Sit down.

306
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,040
Luo Luo, you sit here.

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,520
Here you go.

308
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,920
Your dress looks pretty.

309
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
Why am I at her house?

310
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,160
I didn't do anything, right?

311
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,880
It's inconvenient to ask about it
since Luo Luo is here.

312
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,080
He must be thinking about the incident last night.

313
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,560
I won't tell him, let him feel anxious.

314
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,400
She definitely thought that
I was acting to be drunk

315
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,320
so that I can make an excuse to come here.

316
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm so embarrassing.

317
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,360
Be mad at me, right?

318
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,400
Fine.

319
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
Let's see who loses first.

320
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,640
You both mind your health while holding grudges.

321
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,640
You You.

322
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,840
Please arrange the meeting with Izumino today

323
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
as soon as possible.

324
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,360
These few days

325
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,280
I won't have time to look after you.

326
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,320
Be good.

327
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,280
I'll go first.

328
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,320
I want to tell you something about work.

329
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,360
Go ahead.

330
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
This problem has been settled.

331
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
The public relations department
will issue a statement later.

332
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,200
Your brand is about to go on sale.

333
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
The shopping festival is around the corner.

334
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,760
All brands are preparing for a battle.

335
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
So the factory orders

336
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,920
are already full.

337
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,920
You hurry back

338
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
and talk to the human resource department.

339
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,760
Let them help you

340
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,560
to stuff in your order.

341
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,800
No need.

342
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,720
I will find another factory myself.

343
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,480
You won't be able to find one

344
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,160
at this time.

345
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Whether it is possible or not,

346
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
you don't have to worry about all these.

347
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,120
Although I am a contract designer

348
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,960
of your company,

349
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
but I can settle

350
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
my things by myself.

351
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
What attitude is that?

352
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,400
Nothing.

353
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm always being this way.

354
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,960
Don't be elusive.

355
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm talking about work.

356
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,960
If you want to talk about work,

357
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,920
do it in the company.

358
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,680
This is my house.

359
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
Logically speaking, at this time

360
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
you shouldn't be in my house, right?

361
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Okay, okay, okay.

362
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,200
I have a parent meeting next week.

363
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,840
Who is going?

364
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,840
I'll go.

365
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,240
Otherwise, who will go?

366
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
We are at her house.

367
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,360
Hurry and go back home with me.

368
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,920
Let's go, why are you still sitting here?

369
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,080
Take off my clothes.

370
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,040
Now?

371
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,720
Right now.

372
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,360
Huo Chen Dong.

373
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,800
Shen Pei Pei?

374
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,320
I have been waiting for you for long.

375
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,280
Why are you waiting for me?

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,640
No, no.

377
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
I came to the bank to deal with some affairs.

378
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,200
What a coincidence, I didn't expect that

379
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,080
I can meet you.

380
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
That's quite coincidental.

381
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'll go first.

382
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,960
Wait a minute.

383
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,760
I...

384
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
Wait for me in the car.

385
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
Is there anything else?

386
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,319
Actually, it's not a big deal.

387
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,720
You see, it's at noon now.

388
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,839
I can't do anything either

389
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,200
if I go in now.

390
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,480
Why don't

391
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
we go for a meal together?

392
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,400
I have some questions

393
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,319
regarding financial management

394
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,160
that I want to ask you.

395
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,160
May I?

396
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,119
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,000
I've made an appointment

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
with a very important client.

399
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,319
They are already waiting for me.

400
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,200
It's okay.

401
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,400
Later is also fine.

402
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,440
I can wait for you until you finish work.

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,920
If you need any advice

404
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
on financial management,

405
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,240
you can ask

406
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,120
our lobby manager.

407
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
I still have work.

408
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,200
I need to go first.

409
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,160
I didn't expect you

410
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,120
to start making a move so fast.

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,680
You like him very much?

412
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,400
But I haven't tell Fang

413
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,480
about today's incident yet.

414
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,680
You don't need to tell her.

415
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,360
She has no feeling at all

416
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
towards Huo Chen Dong.

417
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,120
She just treats him like a buddy.

418
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,400
She won't mind at all.

419
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
But Huo Chen Dong

420
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,080
still cares about her.

421
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,920
I can feel that

422
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,320
he doesn't like me.

423
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,800
Maybe because of the matter

424
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,960
between me and Fang previously.

425
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,840
Although it is a misunderstanding,

426
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
it is not is honorable.

427
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,200
In his heart,

428
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,080
I must be a terrible person.

429
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,680
You have to give him some time.

430
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,560
Let him really

431
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,640
let go of Zhou Fang.

432
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,160
But you don't make any

433
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
rash move anymore like today.

434
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,040
Otherwise, he will think that

435
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,760
you are the kind of girl

436
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,200
who likes to fiddle around.

437
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,200
I am not.

438
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,760
I work hard,

439
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,440
okay?

440
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,440
Do you think our business

441
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,160
is an easy job?

442
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,320
Actually the competition

443
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,200
is extremely intense.

444
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,640
If I don't work hard

445
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,200
to get more connections,

446
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
publish more articles,

447
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,360
how can I manage to have a column?

448
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,560
I know you are excellent.

449
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,680
But what's the use that I'm the only one

450
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,440
to know about this?

451
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
You have to find a way

452
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
to show him

453
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
your best side.

454
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,160
Everyone is so busy this year.

455
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,040
Who has time to learn more about others?

456
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,200
But how can I

457
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
let him know about me more?

458
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,240
That's why I said

459
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,720
you need to take your time.

460
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,200
But Pei Pei,

461
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,680
you are pretty,

462
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,480
with a good family and education background.

463
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,640
You also have many suitors.

464
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,240
Why are you fighting so hard?

465
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,480
I also want to be like Fang,

466
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,920
fight for what I like

467
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,160
by myself.

468
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,920
No matter it's about the job or relationship.

469
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,360
All these

470
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,400
are gifted by Wu San?

471
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,040
I really envy you both.

472
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,840
The people you like

473
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
likes you also.

474
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,560
It is not certain that we can be together

475
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,360
even we like each other.

476
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,560
Nothing.

477
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,920
Aren't you have something to do in the afternoon?

478
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,760
Yes.

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,360
I took a half-day leave.

480
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
There is still a lot to do in the afternoon

481
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
I'll go first.

482
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,080
Bye bye.

483
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,920
Bye bye.

484
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Fang.

485
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,520
Is this what you want?

486
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Yes. That is it.

487
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,800
I'll leave first?

488
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
I will send the parcel on the way too.

489
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,360
You want to get off work earlier, right?

490
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Don't debunk me.

491
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,400
Okay, go quickly.

492
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,200
Thank you, Fang.

493
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,120
Good morning, everyone.

494
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,640
Good morning.

495
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,080
Lin, look at me.

496
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,200
How is it, is it okay?

497
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,200
Not bad.

498
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
No, I mean do I look okay?

499
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,520
Okay.

500
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,120
Do you know how to wear a tie?

501
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,000
Help me.

502
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,960
I do not know how to do it.

503
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,960
Neither of your tie and suit

504
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,680
is matched.

505
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,320
You are a programmer.

506
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,280
No need to wear a tie.

507
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,720
I don't know about this.

508
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,680
I just bought it randomly.

509
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Look at me.

510
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,320
Is there anything else

511
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,000
to be improved?

512
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,960
President Song is coming later.

513
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,280
We need to look more formal.

514
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,760
Can you not be nervous?

515
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,480
Although President Song

516
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,800
usually looks serious,

517
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,040
he is actually very friendly.

518
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,000
That's good.

519
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,720
President Song.

520
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,720
-I was planning to go to the entrance
-President Song.

521
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
to welcome you.

522
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,280
You are quite efficient.

523
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
Everything looks good just in a few days.

524
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,240
They are considered to be

525
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
your officially signed partners.

526
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,880
This is professional management.

527
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,800
Yeah.

528
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,560
Thanks to President Song's investment.

529
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
Otherwise, we may now

530
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
have been driven out of the property.

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
How is progress?

532
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,800
We are doing R&D

533
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,640
according to

534
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,760
your ideas and opinions.

535
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,440
Why not

536
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,360
let me show you around first?

537
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,720
You You, come here.

538
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,360
You You.

539
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,640
You will replace Tang Jie tomorrow

540
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
to contact the supplier.

541
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,840
Let them prepare the stocks

542
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,760
for us as soon as possible.

543
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,520
I will also

544
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,200
contact the factory later.

545
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
You are responsible for handing over the supplier

546
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,440
to the factory.

547
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
Don't make any mistake.

548
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,200
Our brand needs to go on sale

549
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
before the shopping festival.

550
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm most afraid of any mistake to happen.

551
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,560
Otherwise...

552
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Manage your time well.

553
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,840
Okay, I will surely complete the task.

554
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,240
However...

555
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,320
However?

556
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,640
The shopping festival is coming.

557
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,080
All the factories are very busy.

558
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,960
Will it be done

559
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,120
if we find them anxiously?

560
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,480
There will always be a way.

561
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,760
Why don't

562
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
we ask President Song for help?

563
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,040
After all, he is your boyfriend.

564
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm sure he is

565
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,040
definitely willing to help.

566
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,760
And they also have

567
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,800
their own factory.

568
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,360
They have more resources than us.

569
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,760
Forget about it.

570
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,720
He already has

571
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,880
a lot of businesses to deal with.

572
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,040
It's okay, I will settle it.

573
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,320
You can go off work.

574
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,920
Okay, I'll leave first.

575
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,440
Okay.

576
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,680
There is no problem.

577
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,440
Just take care of it.

578
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,920
Don't worry.

579
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,040
By the way,

580
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,720
I drank too much that night.

581
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,600
You are the one sent me back?

582
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,680
Yes.

583
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,840
Where did you send me to?

584
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
Sent back to your home.

585
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Luo Luo picked you up.

586
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,320
Did she?

587
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,520
What happened?

588
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,040
Nothing, I drank too much.

589
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Drank too much.

590
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,160
Hello, welcome.

591
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,780
[Qin Qing]

592
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,520
Hello.

593
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,440
Are you available tonight?

594
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,960
Come to my house.

595
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,520
Tonight?

596
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,040
I can't go tonight.

597
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,080
I am having a gathering

598
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
with the development team.

599
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,480
I guess it will end late.

600
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,240
Okay, do your work first.

601
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,120
Fang.

602
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,680
We have already contacted

603
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,000
all the available factories.

604
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,520
They said every workshop

605
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
had already started to operate.

606
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,240
Only these few factories

607
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,400
didn't really reject us.

608
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,680
I feel that Director Su from Su Zhou

609
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,560
is quite a nice person.

610
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,720
Maybe there is a chance.

611
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,520
Director Du, hello.

612
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,040
This is Zhou Fang Studio.

613
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,160
One of our employees

614
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,120
contacted you today.

615
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,560
I would like to know

616
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,120
when you are available,

617
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,240
so that I can pay you a visit

618
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,840
to talk to you

619
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,760
about the processing matter?

620
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
The time is a bit too late.

621
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,600
Because I'm in a hurry.

622
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,320
I was wondering

623
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,440
if you can spare some time tomorrow?

624
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,520
It's okay, have your meeting first.

625
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,200
You can meet me

626
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
after your meeting.

627
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,960
I can wait no matter how long it is.

628
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Okay, okay.

629
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,200
Thank you, thank you.

630
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,200
Okay, bye.

631
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,160
Look, look, look.

632
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,720
There is nothing else he knows to do.

633
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,480
He said that I don't know how to act cute.

634
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,720
He doesn't know how to coax me.

635
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,460
[Song Lin]

636
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,280
What?

637
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,480
If you miss me, just say it.

638
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,320
Why do you keep on

639
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,360
making me sneeze?

640
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,920
How many times did you sneeze?

641
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,920
Twice.

642
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,800
Do you have common sense?

643
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,948
Someone misses or scolds you if it's once
or twice. Thrice means you get a cold.

644
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,360
If that's so, I sneezed once.

645
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
Don't you have a gathering?

646
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,280
I...

647
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Are you avoiding me?

648
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,760
No, Qin Qing.

649
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,920
I did make an appointment

650
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
with them in advance.

651
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,560
But I'm a bit worried about you.

652
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,720
So...

653
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,320
Take a walk with me.

654
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,120
Change back the password.

655
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,440
The password is not important.

656
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,640
The important thing is after changing,

657
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,680
can I still get in?

658
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,400
Our relationship

659
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,480
has already exceeded the deadline.

660
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,680
It's time to end it.

661
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,880
Qin Qing.

662
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,480
I know you recently

663
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,360
have a lot of pressure.

664
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,080
Don't be impulsive.

665
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,640
I know in your heart,

666
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
you have feelings for me.

667
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,040
Three months is enough

668
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,600
for a relationship.

669
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,280
Isn't it good to end it

670
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,160
at the best moment?

671
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
Is it because of your father?

672
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,800
I don't blame you for my dad's affairs.

673
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,000
This is not the reason

674
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,640
of breaking up.

675
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,040
Then what is the reason for the breakup?

676
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,120
I think a lot recently.

677
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,240
I have always lived

678
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
in a conceited and chic way.

679
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,120
Now only I understand

680
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,000
the reason why I

681
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,760
can do whatever I want,

682
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,920
do whatever I like.

683
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,480
Because my parents

684
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
solved all the problems for me.

685
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,480
I was protected so well.

686
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,600
Now I want to protect them too.

687
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,520
Give them peace of mind.

688
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,840
I should make a change.

689
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,240
Your change

690
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,120
is to take me away

691
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,200
from your life?

692
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,400
What can you give me?

693
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,080
I can give you anything

694
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,160
including my life.

695
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,760
What's the use

696
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,640
of your life?

697
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,880
Zuo Yu Lin.

698
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,840
Go find a girl

699
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,040
that is more suitable for you.

700
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,280
An elder woman like me

701
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
is not suitable for you at all.

702
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,080
Dating with an elder woman

703
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,960
is really not fun.

704
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,520
There is no such thing

705
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
in this world.

706
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,600
I love you

707
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,600
with a feeling of a man

708
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,520
who loves a woman.

709
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,680

Qing, you broke up so suddenly.

719
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,280
Aren't you afraid that
you will regret in the future?

720
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,000
I do not know either

721
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,160
if I will regret.

722
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,520
But I have said it.

723
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,840
Even one day in the future

724
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,640
I really regret it,

725
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,240
I have no way.

726
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,920
Actually during the period

727
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,280
that I was dating with Wu San,

728
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,040
I think he is really good.

729
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
Although we have

730
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,560
different opinions on some matters,

731
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,480
he is always

732
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,280
tolerant to me.

733
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,880
Now my dad is sick.

734
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,840
To be honest, I'm quite puzzled.

735
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,760
I haven't figured out

736
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,160
how I'm going to get along

737
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,440
with Wu San in the future.

738
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
I have no confidence.

739
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,840
To be honest,

740
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,840
sometimes I do feel

741
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,960
that I have gone too far.

742
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,200
But...

743
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,000
I don't know how to say about it.

744
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,800
Forget about it, I'm done here.

745
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,840
Don't talk anymore, let's drink.

746
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,080
I'm fine.

747
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,520
I still have my dream even losing my love.

748
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,520
I have decided

749
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,160
I want to work hard.

750
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,040
Do my job well.

751
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
I want to be the most famous jewelry designer

752
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,680
in the world.

753
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,080
Okay, I support you.

754
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,560
If anyone of us loses motivation

755
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,360
in the future,

756
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
let's just remind each other.

757
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,080
Anyway in this world,

758
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,720
without love,

759
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,560
we still have our dreams.

760
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Even if I lose my dreams,

761
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,640
I still have friends.

762
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,240
Yes, you have us.

763
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,720
Come.

764
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,640
Cheers.

765
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll open the door.

766
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,360
It's okay, let me go.

767
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,360
Pour some wine for her.

768
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,480
Who is that?

769
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,800
Nothing.

770
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,760
Food.

771
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,560
Coincidentally, I don't have food now.

772
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
Let's eat something, don't just drink.

773
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,960
Looks good.

774
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,760
I want to get drunk today.

775
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,560
You have to accompany me.

776
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,920
I'll go to get wine.

777
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,440
Okay.

778
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,000
You are Zhou Fang?

779
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,199
Director Du, hello.

780
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
Hell, sorry to keep you waiting.

781
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,120
No, no.

782
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,760
Please, have a seat.

783
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,120
Here, have a cup of tea.

784
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,600
Thank you.

785
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,320
Please.

786
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,240
Thank you, Director Du.

787
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,240
Director Du, I come to you this time

788
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,840
is because I want to ask you something.

789
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,200
We have a batch of clothes here

790
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,080
that needs to go on sale

791
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,920
during the shopping festival.

792
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,680
President Zhou,

793
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,440
your order

794
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,360
is quite stressful for us to handle.

795
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,920
Yes.

796
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,480
I know many factories recently

797
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,560
are having a lot of pressure.

798
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,200
The reason I come to find you

799
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,880
is that I know about

800
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,800
the scale of your factory

801
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,840
and your craftmanship.

802
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,960
I certainly can't ask you

803
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,040
to digest

804
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,240
all the brand products.

805
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:32,960
How about

806
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
we send some of our garments

807
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,320
that needs higher craftsmanship

808
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,880
to be processed at your factory?

809
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,560
This...

810
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,400
Director Du.

811
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,960
I really hope to cooperate

812
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,000
with a high-quality manufacturer

813
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,920
like you.

814
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,920
Of course, I know it very well.

815
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,080
Now everyone

816
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,920
is fighting with time,

817
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,840
and factories.

818
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,680
You are having a lot of pressure,

819
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
because the expenses for the workers

820
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
are also increasing.

821
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,080
We can adjust

822
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,280
the price.

823
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,640
President Zhou.

824
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,200
The situation now

825
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
is indeed the same as what you said.

826
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,840
These few years,

827
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,680
our factory is

828
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,200
getting harder and harder.

829
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,840
Yes.

830
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,760
So,

831
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,640
President Zhou, please give me some time.

832
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
Let me think about it.

833
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,160
Sure, no problem.

834
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,200
Director Du.

835
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,520
Now it is time for lunch.

836
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,320
Why don't

837
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,120
we have a meal together?

838
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,080
Well, it is...

839
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
Okay.

840
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,460
[Our Story]

841
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,600

You do?

is a little bit ordinary,

846
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,320

I heard that

this year, Su Yu Shan's side

948

What do you mean?

949
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,160
Do we need to start a price war with them?

950
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,560
The consumers will be

951

going after for the discounts.

952
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,560
Su Yu Shan has more capital

953

than us.

954
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,440

on the matter of the factory?

You can settle it

962
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,560
with just a phone call.

963
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,800

She has the ability to do this well.

966

consuming time and energy.

968
