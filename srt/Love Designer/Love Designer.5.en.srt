But because

it's so nice

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,320
to have such a boyfriend.

177
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,680
Look.

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
They look so good together.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,120
Stop your gossiping.

180
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,080
There is nothing

181
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,960
between me and Song Lin.

182
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,360
Find something better to do.

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,360
He's quite handsome.

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
I think they look good together.

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
Hello, Zhou Fang speaking.

186
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,960
Lu Na?

187
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,200
President Song,

188
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,600
your news with Zhou Fang

189
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,880
must have been a plot.

190
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
Look at the reaction time.

191
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,480
All of your competitors

192
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,960
and Lu Na's rivals

193
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,640
are sitting back with their popcorn.

194
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,920
This isn't anything new.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
When has it not been a plot?

196
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,560
Well...

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
How should we respond?

198
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,280
We don't have to respond.

199
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
Why should we bother?

200
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,360
Hello,

201
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,000
I am Zhou Fang,

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,920
a fashion designer.

203
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,280
Miss Lu Na and I...

204
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,320
Yes, I know.

205
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,560
Come in.

206
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
Take a seat and wait for a while.

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,320
Sure.

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
Hello, Miss Lu Na.

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Hello, I am Zhou Fang.

210
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,280
Hello.

211
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,520
I hope you are fine with me

212
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,640
showing up all of a sudden.

213
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,120
Have a seat.

214
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,160
Thank you.

215
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
I've heard Song Lin mention

216
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,680
you before.

217
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,960
He was most probably

218
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
talking bad about me.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
I asked you to come over today

220
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
because I want to get to know you.

221
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,120
Secondly,

222
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
I want to ask you for a favor.

223
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,080
Please go ahead.

224
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,160
Here is the thing.

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,360
I need to

226
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,240
attend an awards ceremony

227
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
sometime later.

228
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
But

229
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,640
some issue came up with

230
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,720
the sponsor of my dress.

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
Plus, I've been thinking

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,840
to work with

233
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,880
some of the local designers.

234
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,480
So...

235
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Would you like to

236
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
design a dress for me?

237
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,680
You want me

238
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,600
to design for you?

239
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,200
Why?

240
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
You don't want to?

241
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,280
I'd like to.

242
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,240
Of course, I'd like to

243
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
design a dress for you.

244
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,800
How about this?

245
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,400
Maybe you can tell me

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,600
what dress you're looking for?

247
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,000
The material,

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
sense of design,

249
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,360
or color,

250
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll make a dress of your choice.

251
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,720
Let me write it down.

252
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:06,960
Good.

253
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,720
I've been working my back at the gym

254
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,640
and it looks pretty good,

255
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,240
so

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
we can have an open or low cut at the back.

257
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,680
Okay.

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,680
The waistline must be flattering.

259
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,960
As for the material,

260
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,160
recently,

261
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,080
I watched

262
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,720
a red-carpet show of Hollywood,

263
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,680
I like

264
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,600
the black organza

265
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,280
of one of the black dresses there.

266
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
It'll be great if you can use that.

267
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
As for the color,

268
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,280
maybe something bright.

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,160
Okay.

270
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,680
Zhou Fang.

271
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,360
Zhou Fang.

272
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Where is she?

273
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
What are you doing?

274
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,000
I thought you were dead.

275
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,160
I haven't even finished my work yet.

276
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
How can I die?

277
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,800
These days, lots of people

278
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,720
die from overwork.

279
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,480
Be careful, ma'am.

280
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
You're not

281
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,240
in your early 20's anymore

282
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,560
when you could stay up late

283
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
yet be energetic the next day.

284
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,360
In my heart,

285
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,200
we are always in our 20's.

286
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,720
I'll go take a shower

287
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,640
and accompany you later.

288
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,360
Okay.

289
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,120
[Wan Feng Group]

290
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
Is Chief Qin really fired?

291
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,680
Does it have anything to do with

292
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
our company's brand leakage?

293
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,640
Probably.

294
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,640
Is he

295
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,360
really a mole?

296
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
But Chief Qin is one of the

297
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,360
company's founding members.

298
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,640
I'd never thought that

299
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,200
he would do

300
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
something like this.

301
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:39,930
[Song Lin thinks it's Chief Qin, so he fired him.]

302
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,800
What were you thinking?

303
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,080
Coming here to work?

304
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,080
It's not that bad.

305
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,520
I take it as a transition.

306
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
Why do you do this to yourself?

307
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,640
Coming all the way here

308
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,840
just because the rent is cheaper.

309
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,960
The first step is always the hardest.

310
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,560
Independent brand

311
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,720
emphasizes style and touch.

312
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,760
You expect customers

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,120
to come to this kind of place?

314
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,800
Who said I have no customers?

315
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
I just received a huge order.

316
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,680
But somehow,

317
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm not too confident in it.

318
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,240
What is it?

319
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,320
Luna asked me

320
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,400
to design a dress for her.

321
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,920
And she wants to wear it

322
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,080
at the film festival next month.

323
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,640
No.

324
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
This smells fishy.

325
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,080
Did you accept it?

326
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,760
You accepted it.

327
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:35,880
I think

328
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,080
she was sincere about it.

329
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Oh, my dear Fang.

330
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,160
There must be something going on

331
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,320
between Lu Na and Song Lin.

332
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,720
The moment his news with you came out,

333
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,000
she came to find you.

334
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,040
She's obviously

335
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,200
checking out her rival.

336
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,240
Trying to find out

337
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
what you are worth

338
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
and whether you'll be a threat to her.

339
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,720
Do you understand?

340
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
I am

341
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,440
a threat to her?

342
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,280
What a joke!

343
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,560
Plus, there is nothing

344
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,080
between Song Lin and me.

345
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
What is she worried about?

346
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,720
Put a sock in it.

347
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,600
Based on

348
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,840
my experience of many years,

349
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
through the detection and understanding

350
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
of men's micro-expressions,

351
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm sure that

352
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,000
Song Lin likes you.

353
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,440
He doesn't like me.

354
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,000
Who's the expert here?

355
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,600
You are.

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,800
He likes you.

357
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,880
Fine.

358
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,200
Let's assume he does like me.

359
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
If he dumps

360
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,920
such a good girlfriend

361
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,680
to get together with me,

362
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,720
how is he different

363
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,640
from Wang Ze Yang?

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,440
What does it matter to you?

365
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
Of course, it matters to me.

366
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,960
If it doesn't matter to me,

367
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,160
how am I different

368
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
from Wang Ze Yang's mistress?

369
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,040
Mistress is mistress.

370
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,520
Whether it's done actively or passively,

371
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,680
she'll always be a mistress.

372
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,440
Fine.

373
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,240
What you said is right.

374
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Coffee.

375
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,880
It's almost Luo Luo's birthday, isn't it?

376
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,120
You even remember her birthday?

377
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,840
My friend's sister

378
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,640
is my sister.

379
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
What's the plan?

380
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,520
No plan.

381
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,080
I don't even know

382
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,680
what the youngsters want

383
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,360
nowadays.

384
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,640
I'll ask my friend.

385
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Friend?

386
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,440
Male or female?

387
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
Female.

388
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,360
Good looking?

389
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,240
Single?

390
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
What profession?

391
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,360
What does that have to do with you?

392
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,320
Let me think...

393
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
Is it the one on the phone last time?

394
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,960
The tough one?

395
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,360
Enough with your guesses.

396
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,000
Help me with that.

397
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,480
Hello?

398
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,280
Zhou Fang,

399
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,560
are you busy?

400
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,920
A little bit.

401
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,040
I need your help

402
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,200
with something.

403
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
What?

404
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
Let's talk face to face.

405
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,310
I'll meet you later.

406
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Zhou Fang?

407
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,200
Why are you such a busybody?

408
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,040
What's so important that

409
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,110
you need to talk face to face?

410
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,040
What's so important?

411
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
What's the matter?

412
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,800
It is

413
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,920
Luo Luo's birthday in two days.

414
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,800
I want to ask you for advice.

415
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,640
Is there

416
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
any good way to celebrate it?

417
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,400
You're getting used to

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,320
ordering me around.

419
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah.

420
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
After all, you are

421
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,600
slightly better than me in this aspect.

422
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,920
Fine.

423
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
I'll think about it

424
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,440
and tell you later.

425
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
The new

426
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
didn't affect you, right?

427
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,840
Song Lin.

428
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
I want to ask you a question.

429
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,560
You need to answer it honestly.

430
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,360
Sure.

431
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,920
Do you like me?

432
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,920
Yes.

433
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
I knew it...

434
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,800
What?

435
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
I do like you.

436
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Are you out of your mind?

437
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,280
Are you out of your mind?

438
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,480
What's wrong if I like you?

439
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,880
It doesn't mean anything.

440
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,920
It doesn't mean I'm going after you,

441
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,960
or we're in a relationship.

442
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,280
I'm not asking you to do anything.

443
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,760
Are you out of your mind?

444
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,400
You have a celebrity girlfriend

445
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,640
and you say you like someone else.

446
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
Are you a bastard?

447
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,040
Treat her well.

448
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,660
Treasure her before it's too late.

449
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,160
As for Luo Luo's birthday,

450
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
I'll see what I can do.

451
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,920
I'll think of a way.

452
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,160
I'm doing this for her,

453
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,120
not for you.

454
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,540
Don't get the wrong idea.

455
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,240
She's not my girlfriend.

456
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,480
That's what they all say.

457
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
Excuses.

458
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,640
Why do I need to lie to you?

459
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,360
Do you think I would believe you?

460
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,560

I'll contact you.

Sure. I'll leave it to you.

471

Don't worry.

472
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
You head back first.

473
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,800
I still have something on.

474
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,360
Okay. I'll get going.

475
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,840
Okay.

476
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,240
Bye.

477
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,760
Bye.

478
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,120
Are you unhappy?

479
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,080
No.

480
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
Were you thinking that

481
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,520
she and I looked like a couple?

482
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,720
Are you a bit jealous?

483
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
You're overthinking it.

484
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
A while ago,

485
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,880
I made you unhappy.

486
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
I don't even know what to do.

487
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,000
That girl is

488
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,880
a girlfriend of

489
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,600
my friend in college.

490
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,280
Today, for their engagement ring,

491
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,000
I introduced them

492
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,600
to your place.

493
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,280
Just so...

494
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,600
I could find a reason to see you.

495
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,920
Are you done? Kid.

496
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,640
Can you stop

497
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
calling me a kid?

498
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,520
But what you say

499
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,200
and do

500
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,600
is really like a kid.

501
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,120
I...

502
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,880
You what?

503
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,880
I want to treat you to a meal.

504
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
I'm not hungry yet.

505
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,760
Not hungry...

506
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,760
But

507
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
I can eat a little.

508
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,800
What do you like to eat?

509
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,200
There is

510
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,320
a new concept restaurant nearby.

511
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,040
It's pretty good.

512
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,920
Let's go there.

513
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,120
Lead the way.

514
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
That is smooth.

515
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
Don't people hold hands when they go on dates?

516
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Do you think

517
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,040
this counts as

518
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,000
our first date?

519
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,480
Is it?

520
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,280
Isn't it?

521
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,540

523
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,960

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,160
we add a few celebrities in?

701
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,400
How?

702
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,720
As judges?

703
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,200
Celebrity judges

704
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
are too common.

705
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,280
Plus,

706
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,840
there is always

707
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
the feeling of superiority,

708
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,040
not down-to-earth.

709
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,280
As contestants.

710
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,400
As contestants.

711
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,080
Wait...

712
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
Am I the only one who didn't get it?

713
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,280
How can they be contestants?

714
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,920
Celebrities aren't designers.

715
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:56,026
[Lu Na: Bring the dress to Kai Rui Hotel
for me to try on at 3 p.m.]

716
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,680
Why are you here?

717
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
I'm here for Lu Na.

718
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,920
Come in and have a seat.

719
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,400
Have a seat.

720
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:21,880
It's okay.

721
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,800
Want to eat something?

722
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
You're here, Zhou Fang.

723
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,320
Miss Lu Na.

724
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,400
Have you brought the dress?

725
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,040
Yes, I have.

726
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,240
This is your coffee.

727
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,840
Thank you.

728
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,320
No worries.

729
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Take the dress out.

730
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,520
Let me have a look.

731
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,120
Now?

732
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,520
There are no outsiders here. It's alright.

733
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm not sure about the fit.

734
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
Please try it on when you're available.

735
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,760
Didn't I ask you

736
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,800
to cut a slit at the back?

737
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,240
And this black organza.

738
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,600
Why did you choose this?

739
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,280
Don't you think this black organza

740
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,760
looks very cheap?

741
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,280
And this dress.

742
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,920
The color is too bright.

743
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,720
It's not low profile at all.

744
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,840
It doesn't fit my image.

745
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,880
So...

746
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
you can open up the back.

747
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,480
The waistline must be flattering.

748
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,840
As for the material,

749
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,920
recently,

750
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I watched

751
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,560
a red-carpet show of Hollywood,

752
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,160
I like

753
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,400
the black organza

754
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,120
of one of the black dresses there.

755
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
As for the color,

756
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
maybe something bright.

757
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,800
I thought

758
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,640
you could surprise me.

759
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,640
It's unexpected

760
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,080
you are not special.

761
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,560
It's my fault

762
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,800
for not being able to design a dress

763
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
that meets my customer's expectations.

764
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
There are 10 days left.

765
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,360
I guarantee that you'll be happy with it.

766
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,600
What if I still don't like it

767
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,320
after 10 days?

768
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,320
What do I wear for the red carpet?

769
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,190
If you're still not happy after 10 days,

770
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,150
I'll design for you.

771
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,080
Let's go.

772
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
She must have done it on purpose.

773
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,240
What black organza,

774
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,640
sequins and open back?

775
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,200
Is that even wearable?

776
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,920
She's just picking on me.

777
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,600
The more she does it,

778
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,080
the more I need to prove myself to her.

779
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Prove what?

780
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,880
She humiliated you.

781
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,880
Why should you bother about her?

782
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,040
She's being a bully.

783
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,880
What do you think about this color?

784
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,560
Zhou Fang.

785
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,240
Come out.

786
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,040
Why?

787
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,480
Come out with me.

788
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm busy.

789
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,680
What are you doing?

790
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
Prepare to eat your words.

791
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,560
That's a good shout.

792
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,520
How is it?

793
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,080
You've shouted it out,

794
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,960
are you fine now?

795
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,840
Feel better?

796
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
Thanks for helping me out today.

797
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,400
I wasn't exactly helping you.

798
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,160
I'm afraid that things would
get ugly between you two.

799
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,320
Although you

800
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,640
took me out for a ride tonight,

801
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,920
but the problem

802
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,680
between me and Lu Na

803
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,440
is another thing.

804
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Don't try to make up for her.

805
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
I didn't take you out

806
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,640
to moderate

807
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
the relationship between you two.

808
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
I just feel that...

809
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,320
Today,

810
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,200
you were bullied...

811
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,760
pretty badly.

812
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,200
I took you out to cheer you up a bit.

813
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,240
Zhou Fang.

814
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Actually Lu Na and I...

815
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,440
are working partners,

816
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,400
not a couple.

817
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,040
Why are you telling me this?

818
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,480
What does that have to do with me?

819
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,960
It has

820
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,880
nothing to do with you.

821
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,960
But I just

822
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,880
wanted to tell you.

823
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,320
Both of us

824
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,360
signed a contract.

825
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,600
We're all for our own benefits.

826
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,240
That's it.

827
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,880
You like to design very much?

828
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,960
I saw the dress

829
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
that you designed today.

830
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
From a friend's perspective,

831
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,480
objectively,

832
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,200
I think there is

833
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,440
a big room for improvement.

834
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,120
What do you mean?

835
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,160
It didn't look that great.

836
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,600
You need to know...

837
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,440
there is still quite a big difference

838
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,760
between you and an international haute couture.

839
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,520
You mean

840
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,160
I'm not capable of designing

841
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,240
a dress that she'll be happy with.

842
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,760
I...

843
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,920
No...

844
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,600
I understand what you mean.

845
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,680
I know I have

846
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
a big room of improvement

847
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,240
as you said.

848
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,560
Any problem with that?

849
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,760
Isn't that a problem?

850
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,800
As a designer,

851
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,760
knowing how to do sketches

852
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,480
and sewing

853
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,400
doesn't make you a designer.

854
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,320
That's a tailor.

855
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,480
Right?

856
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,080
What makes a designer?

857
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,000
A designer needs to have

858
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,920
one's own philosophy.

859
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,040
To give one's own brand

860
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
its own color and soul.

861
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,160
Moreover,

862
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,040
you need to let your consumers

863
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,480
know and feel your philosophy.

864
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,440
Why else would one be called a designer?

865
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,640
Mr Song, you surely

866
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,680
like to dive in philosophies.

867
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Indeed, your company

868
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,320
has a strong base of philosophy.

869
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,160
But from the choices of materials

870
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
to the designs,

871
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,000
there is no sense of comfort

872
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,800
for customers.

873
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
Plus, your designs

874
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,520
are very outdated.

875
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,520
I guess it's been a while

876
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,440
since you did market research.

877
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,240
There's another weak point

878
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,960
which I'm not sure

879
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,080
whether it'll hurt your feelings saying it.

880
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,960
Your website

881
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,640
is very not user friendly.

882
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,680
Thanks for bringing me here.

883
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
You're still working?

884
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,920
I can't sleep.

885
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,040
You're still working on Lu Na's case?

886
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,160
I know she's making fun of me.

887
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,840
And I know I'm stubborn.

888
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,080
But I just want her to know that

889
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm capable of designing

890
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,040
a beautiful dress.

891
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,440
It doesn't matter whether she needs it.

892
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,800
It's my business whether I want to do it.

893
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,320
I won't let them look down on me.

894
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,840
I see

895
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,240
you're still ticked off by Song Lin.

896
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,040
When I think about it,

897
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
what he said was right.

898
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,680
But

899
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,320
I can't give up

900
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,080
just because of

901
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,920
what he said.

902
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
I've been mocked for countless of times.

903
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
He's not the first nor the last.

904
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,240
The thing he likes is

905
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,280
this cute stubbornness of you.

906
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,280
If you really

907
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,400
want to prove your capabilities,

908
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,720
you should seriously think of

909
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,680
how you can improve yourself.

910
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,160
Bring your clothes

911
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,920
to my shop

912
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,200
to increase the exposure.

913
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,680
At the same time,

914
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,520
it doesn't affect your online sales.

915
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,600
The customers who have

916
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,520
special requests,

917
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,400
would ask for customization

918
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,120
for both clothes and accessories.

919
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,200
This is not to help you.

920
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,440
It's called win-win.

921
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,680
I never knew

922
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
you had so many weird ideas

923
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,120
in your head.

924
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,040
Of course.

925
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,360
So that's set.

926
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,320
I'll go to bed now.

927
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,040
So tired.

928
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,320
Okay.

929
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,400
You come in soon too.

930
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,520
Okay.

931
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,120
What's up?

932
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,200
Have a look

933
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,000
at my latest work.

934
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,720
How is it? Pretty good, right?

935
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,840
Pretty nice.

936
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,040
Sign me up for a class.

937
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,440
I want to learn it properly.

938
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Why do you take art classes

939
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,480
all of a sudden?

940
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,440
What do you mean 'all of a sudden'?

941
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,680
I told you a long time ago.

942
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,240
You're the one

943
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,160
who never paid attention, okay?

944
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,360
Rather than focusing on

945
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,120
my hopeless performance

946
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,800
in academics,

947
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,600
why not explore my talents?

948
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,400
If I work hard enough,

949
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,480
I might even get into

950
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,640
a decent art college.

951
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Luo Luo, listen up,

952
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,440
art colleges

953
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,680
has high a standard for

954
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
your academic grades as well.

955
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,160
Plus, they have higher requirements

956
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,040
for certain specialties.

957
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
Think it through.

958
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,640
Don't act based on your brief enthusiasm.

959
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,440
Otherwise, it'll just be a waste of time.

960
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,560
As long as it's something that I like,

961
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
something that I set my mind on,

962
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,840
I can do it.

963
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,760
Is that so?

964
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,760
Forget it.

965
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,320
I knew I was wasting breath.

966
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,280
If Zhou Fang was here,

967
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,280
she would understood me.

968
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,560
She told you to take classes?

969
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,520
Yeah.

970
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,080
She has pretty good taste.

971
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,960
She appreciates me.

972
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,880
Unlike you.

973
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,080
What did I do?

974
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,560
I care for you all the time.

975
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,840
I raised you since you were young.

976
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,600
And I'm not better than
someone else appreciating you.

977
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,920
You're the one who brought Zhou Fang over.

978
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,960
You like her, don't you?

979
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,480
Why would I like her?

980
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,080
If you don't like her,

981
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,760
why do you keep

982
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,880
looking for her?

983
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,200
Remember to sign me up for a class.

984
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,560
Stop blabbering.

985
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,640
