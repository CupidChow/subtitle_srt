the training camp next Firday?

176
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,390
Yes, I am.

177
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,480
I heard the outdoor activities

178
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,350
are quite interesting.

179
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,880
No class, and don't need to go home,

180
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,720
of course, it's interesting.

181
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,390
Hey,

182
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,640
let's say if

183
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,830
Zhou Fang

184
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,390
and my brother were together,

185
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,720
that made Zhou Fang my sister-in law,

186
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,200
doesn't that make you

187
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
my nephew?

188
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Great-nephew.

189
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,920
Song Luo, who are you taking advantage of?

190
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,000
I think,

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,230
youngsters being playful

192
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,600
is not a big deal.

193
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
He will naturally be calm,

194
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,550
when he's tired of it

195
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,390
and have done with it.

196
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,200
My son...

197
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,040
My son is settled after he got married.

198
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,270
I know, your son is brilliant.

199
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,270
Didn't your son get married?

200
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,550
Can you say something useful?

201
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Someone possible.

202
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,350
Exactly.

203
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,440
What do you mean by

204
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
it's okay to flirt around?

205
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,230
Are you going to introduce a playboy

206
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
to my Fang Fang?

207
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,600
Exactly.

208
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
I don't think that's right.

209
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,880
What if

210
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,200
he flirts around his whole life?

211
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,390
What she said is pretty reasonable.

212
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,640
A man having a good career is the most important.

213
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,110
Find a rich one.

214
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,880
My cousin's

215
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,790
neighbor,

216
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
working in the financial industry,

217
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,510
is an overseas returnees.

218
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,670
I think he is good fit for Fang Fang.

219
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,550
Sounds good.

220
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,350
How old is he?

221
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,670
Six years old.

222
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,440
Six years old?

223
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,920
Six years old?

224
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,720
What do you mean six years old?

225
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,110
Yes, six years old!

226
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,440
Attending a kindergarten.

227
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,270
His kid! His kid!

228
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,270
He has a kid at the age of six?

229
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,600
A divorcee?

230
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,950
How can Fang Fang

231
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,920
be with a divorced person?

232
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,670
Exactly!

233
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,110
How can you come up with this?

234
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,350
All of you,

235
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,720
our kids,

236
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,760
have their own destiny,

237
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,230
you old ladies are

238
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,760
sitting here and talking nonsense,

239
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,110
what's the point?

240
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,070
You! What are you talking about?

241
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,040
What do you know?

242
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me tell you,

243
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
it's hard for a woman to find a partner
after the age of thirty.

244
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

245
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,600
What?

246
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,480
You want Zhou Fang

247
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
to be single for life?

248
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,880
That won't be possible.

249
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,390
My daughter is brilliant.

250
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,720
I believe

251
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,720
she can find

252
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,760
a good husband.

253
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,320
Brag about it! Go on!

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,110
What are you doing here?

255
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,760
Just sitting here talking,
not doing anything.

256
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,720
Right?

257
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Go and mop the floor.

258
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,550
I'm drinking tea.

259
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,440
Go and mop the floor!

260
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,640
Mop the floor, mop the floor.

261
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,950
Let me tell you all,

262
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm good at mopping floors.

263
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
What did you do to him?

264
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,790
Exactly.

265
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,350
That's what a son-in-law should be.

266
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,150
Alright, enough about him.

267
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
Why are we talking about him?

268
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,590
He's in the past.

269
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,000
Where were we just now?

270
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,790
Where were we?

271
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,200
Divorce. Six-year-old kid!

272
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,350
Six years old! Six years old!
The kid is six years old!

273
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,230
It's a good fit.

274
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,790
It's can't be! No way!

275
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,910
No way!

276
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a good fit!

277
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,230
Exactly! No way!

278
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,640
Miss Fang,

279
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,440
our sales for these few days

280
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,550
is quite good.

281
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,910
We sold dozens of them.

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,590
Miss Fang,

283
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,200
are you worried about

284
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,230
not having custom-made order?

285
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,880
No reputation and no popularity,

286
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,910
there's no point to be worried.

287
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,080
But we are updating

288
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,200
our live stream everyday.

289
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,350
It will takes times

290
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,590
to promote our brand.

291
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,030
The live stream is for our original brand,

292
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,320
not for customization,

293
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
the target audiences are different.

294
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,710
What if we do some promotion?

295
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,790
Such as advertisement.

296
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,110
It's not that it can't be done,

297
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,550
but if the ads

298
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,400
aren't strong enough,

299
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,000
the promotion

300
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
won't have any effect.

301
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,710
If we want the ads to be effective,

302
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,150
it will cost us a fortune.

303
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,350
So we don't want to spend money,

304
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,710
but we still want to be seen. Then...

305
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,960
Why don't we enter a contest?

306
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,590
I just saw a reality show

307
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,400
recruiting designers.

308
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,440
Reality show?

309
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,440
Come and take a look.

310
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,840
Is this reliable?

311
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,640
Take a look first.

312
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,350
Chuang Pin Net

313
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,840
might become the program's

314
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,150
title advertiser.

315
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,710
I think it's pretty reliable.

316
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,880
You should sign up.

317
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,840
With your ability and talent,

318
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
the champion will be you.

319
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,150
Exactly, such a great opportunity.

320
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
What are you worried about?

321
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,760
But this program is own by

322
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,670
Wan Feng Group.

323
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,230
And what's wrong with that?

324
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,590
I think whether we succeed or not,

325
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,550
it's all our own effort.

326
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,840
It's not like we pulled some strings,

327
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
so what are you scared of?

328
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,550
Who said I'm scared?

329
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,640
Sign up!

330
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,550
Alright!

331
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,030
Cheers.

332
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,400
No alcohol for me, I was driving here.

333
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,080
Let's get down to business.

334
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,790
Alright.

335
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,520
I have got a general idea

336
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,710
about your program.

337
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,670
The company

338
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,840
hasn't finalized it,

339
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,840
but

340
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,030
I'll coordinate it.

341
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,230
As long as you need it.

342
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,110
It's not that I need it,

343
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,520
but this project.

344
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,880
For me, it's just the same.

345
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,230
By the way,

346
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,000
there's a dinner party in a few days.

347
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,320
The company hopes that

348
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,110
the two of us

349
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,230
can attend it together.

350
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,400
On the one hand,

351
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,230
it could give the show

352
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,520
a warm-up.

353
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,670
One the other hand,

354
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,150
it could clear up

355
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,760
all the rumors.

356
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,030
It's all just rumor,

357
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,230
there's no need for clarification.

358
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,840
Now what?

359
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,320
Me, hiring Zhou Fang as my designer,

360
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
makes you unhappy?

361
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,640
Not at all.

362
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't interfere with

363
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
nor control

364
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,910
your behaviors.

365
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
But you can't interfere with

366
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,280
my life

367
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,470
outside of work.

368
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,960
Song Lin,

369
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,790
why are you always

370
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,110
pushing me away from you?

371
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,440
I understand you.

372
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,590
I know that in your heart

373
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,470
you knew it clearly

374
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,080
that I'm your best option.

375
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,110
The best option

376
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,550
is not the right option,

377
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,030
right?

378
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,590
You will know sooner or later that

379
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,150
I am the right one.

380
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,440
About the project

381
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,440
I will ask Wang He

382
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,110
to talk to you.

383
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,110
I will go back to the office first.

384
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,840
I still have something to do.

385
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,960
See you.

386
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,670
Fang.

387
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,150
Zhou Fang, is that you?

388
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,880
Do you like it?

389
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,030
I thought you were still working.

390
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,350
Yes.

391
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,320
This is what I am working on.

392
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,230
Did you do all of these?

393
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,710
Yes.

394
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,910
How did you come in?

395
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,150
I sneaked in.

396
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
Why don't you use the front door

397
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,350
but sneaked in?

398
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,030
Just tell me whether you like it.

399
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,710
Yes, I do.

400
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,880
Do you like the lights or me?

401
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
Have you had dinner?

402
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,910
Not yet.

403
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,960
Come inside.

404
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
The weak are the prey of the strong
they meet again.

405
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,550
Don't get bitten.

406
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,520
Almost there.

407
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,590
Dropped into the hole.

408
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,520
Let me watch.

409
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,550
We are watching.

410
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,520
What are you watching?

411
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,280
Watch this instead.

412
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,030
This, how about this?

413
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,910
Look, is he handsome?

414
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,200
He have good qualities.

415
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,840
Or how about this?

416
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,230
So young.

417
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,110
For what you have picked,

418
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,760
I didn't see any great ones.

419
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
As long as you shut up,

420
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,030
all of them are great.

421
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,520
How about this?

422
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,760
Look at this closely.

423
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,960
Mum.

424
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,230
To be in a relationship

425
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,590
and to get married

426
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,520
all depend on fate.

427
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,670
Of course.

428
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,550
Of course, fate is important.

429
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,840
Do you think that

430
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,840
you should wait for the fate or seek it?

431
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,280
Of course, it should be sought.

432
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,200
Right?

433
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,470
If you wait for it,

434
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,230
you might spend years waiting for it.

435
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,110
When you are old,

436
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,470
you might have no husband or children.

437
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,400
Mum.

438
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,760
Marriage

439
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,440
doesn't guarantee kids.

440
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,710
Even if we have a kid,

441
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,710
it doesn't mean that

442
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,440
the kid will accompany us forever.

443
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,790
Do you

444
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,880
mean yourself?

445
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:41,840
It's not easy

446
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,150
for me to be here

447
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,110
to eat and chat with you all,

448
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,670
can you all stop pressuring me?

449
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,440
What if

450
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,000
you don't mind

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,030
this business?

452
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,350
Get another hobby

453
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,280
and enjoy it.

454
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,400
What do you think?

455
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,790
Zhou Fang. My hobby now,

456
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,470
the only interest now,

457
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,710
the one and only hobby now,

458
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,000
is to get you the right soulmate.

459
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,560
So that you can get married and have kids.

460
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,350
Ru Hui.

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,880
It's at 8 o'clock now.

462
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
You binge-watch a TV series, right?

463
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,560
Let me get you the show.

464
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,110
Old Zhou. Stop it.

465
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,310
You always protect her

466
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,280
at this moment.

467
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
It's for your own good.

468
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,310
Look at yourself. You've spoiled her.

469
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
It's you who have spoiled her.

470
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,430
Now.

471
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,350
Let me tell you.

472
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,640
If you keep doing it,

473
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,470
your daughter won't get any benefit from it.

474
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,160
You're really

475
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,880
spoiling her.

476
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,230
The company is growing now.

477
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,430
There must be a process to be better.

478
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
Actually, in these few years,

479
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,800
besides

480
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,560
preserving the domestic markets,

481
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,110
we've expanded our business
into the global market too.

482
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,430
Actually, in China,

483
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,280
there are many

484
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,000
excellent fashion designers

485
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,110
and

486
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,110
original designs.

487
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,830
In these few years,

488
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,950
our focus is in…

489
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,110
Wait a moment.

490
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,760
You…You…You…

491
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,110
You get me the remote controller.

492
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,560
Let me do it.

493
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,520
Let me do it.

494
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,040
Come on.

495
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,800
Let me do it.

496
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,880
No. This…

497
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,160
You…You have to move it forward.

498
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,800
Wait. Backward, backward. Mum.

499
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,350
Forward.

500
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,470
It's at the back.

501
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,520
It...can only be at the back.

502
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,230
Forward. No. You…

503
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,710
Many people will notice

504
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,950
our company

505
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,110
and recent progress.

506
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,070
He looks so familiar.

507
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,000
President Song is so young and promising.

508
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,280
We're curious about his status now.

509
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,710
These sales executives

510
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,310
look the same

511
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,350
on the television.

512
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,350
No. I can recall it.

513
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,760
I think I saw him somewhere.

514
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,000
I think that this personal affair

515
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,040
should be kept private.

516
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,160
That…What's that?

517
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,950
Blind dating event!

518
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,470
I met him

519
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,040
at the blind dating event.

520
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,280
The one

521
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,070
who took you away.

522
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,520
Did you recognise the wrong person, mum?

523
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,520
Look at him again.

524
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,920
Impossible!

525
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,160
I won't be wrong!

526
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,520
I tell you. That day,

527
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,280
after you left,

528
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,000
I met the

529
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,830
staff.

530
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,590
I asked him.

531
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
What did he said?

532
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,640
He told me that

533
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,400
he didn't even register.

534
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,590
He purposely went for you.

535
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,680
He's the president of

536
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,000
Wan Feng Group.

537
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,520
He was the one who sued you.

538
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,830
Is he troubling you again?

539
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,230
I think that he's not troubling her.

540
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,470
A court case has turned into

541
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,760
a romantic relationship?

542
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,950
Stop it, mum.

543
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,950
You can write a novel.

544
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,680
It's better than what you're doing now.

545
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,590
No. That day,

546
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,560
you didn't return home.

547
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,350
Then, you searched a kid.

548
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
You're doing everything for him.

549
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,640
Old man!

550
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,160
No!

551
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,160
He has a kid.

552
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,310
I'm leaving, mum.

553
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,590
Wait, let me send you off.

554
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,800
Sit down!

555
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,880
Tell me.

556
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,230
What's the relationship

557
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,880
between you and him?

558
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,740
[Tan Ding Foreign Language Middle School]

559
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,350
Luo Luo.

560
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,640
Miss Lu Na!

561
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,680
Why are you here?

562
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,230
I just passed by.

563
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,350
Thinking to visit you.

564
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,310
How do you know that I like him?

565
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,760
It's a limited edition.

566
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,000
How did you get it?

567
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,920
Like it?

568
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,470
Later,

569
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,160
I can bring you

570
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
to his concert.

571
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,160
Really?

572
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,430
Why do you care about me so much?

573
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
You're Song Lin's sister.

574
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,680
Soon,

575
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,110
you'll be my sister.

576
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,040
I should

577
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,190
be good to you.

578
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,680
Then,

579
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,760
I'll accept it.

580
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,880
You're welcome.

581
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,830
Oh yes.

582
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,880
Please add me on WeChat.

583
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,950
Sure.

584
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,350
Tomorrow,

585
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,760
I'll take you out for something delicious.

586
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,950
This is the first time

587
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,830
I feel happy

588
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,000
to have such a brother.

589
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,800
It's my first time too

590
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,520
to feel good

591
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
having a sister.

592
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,400
Miss Lu Na.

593
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm going to school now.

594
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,110
See you tomorrow.

595
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,640
Sure.

596
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,590
See you tomorrow.

597
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,040
Goodbye.

598
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,590
Goodbye.

599
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,040
Song Luo. Song Luo.

600
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,070
What's the relationship

601
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,190
between you and the artist?

602
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,350
A very good relationship.

603
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,230
She even gave me a present.

604
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,560
Why did she give you a present?

605
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,470
Miss.

606
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,190
Hello.

607
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,680
I'd like to inquire about the area here.

608
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,520
Do you have a small unit?

609
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,350
Yes, miss.

610
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,640
We have two or three bedrooms.

611
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,590
Do you want to rent

612
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,400
or to buy a unit?

613
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Rent.

614
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,560
Do you have a unit with two living rooms?

615
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,190
Yes.

616
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,280
It depends on

617
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,000
your requirements.

618
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,430
The cheapest is around

619
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,310
20,000 yuan.

620
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,190
If you want

621
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,920
a better house,

622
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
the price will be more expensive.

623
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,520
It is

624
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,350
a school zone.

625
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,590
Its location

626
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,920
and facilities

627
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
are the best in the city.

628
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,640
It's obvious.

629
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,680
Miss,

630
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,880
I can show you our showroom.

631
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,830
It's fine. I'm just asking.

632
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,880
Thank you.

633
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,430
Miss.

634
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,880
Please leave your contact.

635
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,950
If there's any suitable unit,

636
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,920
I'll contact you.

637
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,560
Sure.

638
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,280
You're back.

639
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,040
This…

640
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,800
I've asked You You to

641
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,920
bring some clothes from your office

642
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,000
for decoration.

643
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,950
How's it?

644
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,520
Later,

645
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,800
you can

646
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,830
bring

647
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,310
your design

648
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,310
to my office for exhibition.

649
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,880
To let more people notice them.

650
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,350
And then,

651
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
you don't

652
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,640
design clothes

653
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,430
at the small studio anymore.

654
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,350
Accompany me more often

655
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,190
when you're free.

656
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,710
So efficient.

657
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,000
How's your

658
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
progress in seeking a new house?

659
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,430
Don't mention it anymore.

660
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,680
I've searched

661
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,710
all the units here.

662
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,310
They are either too costly

663
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,430
or old.

664
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,590
It's fine for me

665
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,800
to stay.

666
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,160
But what about Di?

667
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,400
I don't want to make his life difficult.

668
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,040
I'll check

669
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,350
other areas tomorrow.

670
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,560
Expand my searching area.

671
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,040
What if

672
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,000
I go with you

673
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,800
tomorrow?

674
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,000
If it doesn't work,

675
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,920
then we get another area.

676
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,760
Nowadays, school zones

677
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,880
are costly.

678
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,310
Yes. Not possible to get even one unit.

679
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,190
Hey, hello.

680
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,950
Agent?

681
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,680
Miss. Actually, I'm thinking the same.

682
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,040
I didn't expect that the owner is willing to

683
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,830
rent it at a 50% discount.

684
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
What a good price

685
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,590
for such a good house.

686
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,110
It's not a haunted house, right?

687
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,400
It's a new house.

688
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,880
The owner purchased it for investment.

689
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,070
Look at these.

690
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,470
The furniture

691
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,190
was made by Suofeiya,

692
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,430
an eco-friendly brand.

693
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,680
You can stay without worries.

694
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,830
I think that this house

695
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
is quite good,

696
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,160
but I have no idea

697
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,760
why

698
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,710
it's rented at such a low price.

699
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,070
Miss. It's because

700
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,920
the owner is living overseas.

701
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,470
He's not free

702
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,190
to take care of the unit.

703
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,070
So he entrusted the property to us,

704
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,000
to get a good tenant

705
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,400
who will help to

706
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,280
take care of the unit.

707
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,560
So the price

708
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,640
is not an important matter.

709
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,800
The daylighting is good.

710
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,470
The owner

711
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,590
who is able to get a property here

712
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,070
should have achieved financial freedom.

713
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I think so. He has no money concern.

714
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,710
Or else, he won't

715
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,680
rent it at such a low price.

716
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,400
Another room here.

717
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,430
Yes, there's another room here.

718
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,280
Miss.

719
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,950
The owner has a condition.

720
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,350
The rental must be paid annually.

721
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,430
Deposit won't be returned

722
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,470
if you move out halfway.

723
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,350
It must be paid annually?

724
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,350
Sure, let's get it signed.

725
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,310
Okay.

726
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,800
You're moving out with Di?

727
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,640
Keep your voice down, mum.

728
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,590
Everyone could hear your voice.

729
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,760
It's fine

730
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,520
if my house can't fit you.

731
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,470
But

732
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,800
Qin Qing's house
is not suitable for you either?

733
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,710
I tell you.

734
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,520
What tricks are you playing again?

735
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,880
No, aunt.

736
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,280
I'm in love recently.

737
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,680
She doesn't want to trouble me.

738
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,710
So she wants to get a new house.

739
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,760
She wanted to

740
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
move back to here,

741
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,680
but

742
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,920
our house

743
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,830
is too far

744
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,070
from our office, right?

745
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,040
Spending hours on traffic congestion.

746
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,760
Who can take it, right?

747
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Qing Qing.

748
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,070
You got a boyfriend?

749
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,280
Mum.

750
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,560
Your focus is so…

751
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
You shut up. Shut up.

752
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,160
Shut up. Shut up.

753
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,830
When did you get him?

754
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,950
How long have you two been together?

755
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,760
We just knew each other,

756
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
We knew each other

757
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,760
when going out

758
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,350
with Zhou Fang.

759
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,950
He's not an official

760
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,830
boyfriend.

761
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,760
We try to be together first.

762
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,190
Look.

763
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,760
Look at Qing Qing.

764
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,710
She…

765
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,950
She just hung out.

766
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,880
She could get a boyfriend.

767
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,520
Right? You also hung out.

768
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
But why didn't you get

769
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,590
a boyfriend?

770
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,350
Ru Hui.

771
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,470
Be patient. Why are you so anxious?

772
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,070
Why am I anxious?

773
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,760
I tell you. If she

774
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,000
spends effort

775
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,280
getting a boyfriend,

776
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,710
she won't be

777
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,920
so pathetic now.

778
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,350
Mum.

779
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,800
Don't I need

780
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,950
an image?

781
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,470
It's okay if you want your image.

782
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,880
Bring a boyfriend home.

783
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,310
Then, mum will honor your image.

784
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,000
You see. It's off-topic.

785
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,310
Today, what

786
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,160
are we talking about?

787
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,950
Not about Zhou Fang's

788
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
move?

789
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,430
Yes, dad.

790
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,350
This time,

791
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,070
the house I found

792
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,110
is very near to Di's school.

793
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
It's about ten-minute driving.

794
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,640
It's great.

795
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,280
In future,

796
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,880
Di doesn't have to
wake up that early for school.

797
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,000
Yes.

798
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,190
I can sleep longer.

799
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,160
Great.

800
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,000
You have time for Di.

801
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,520
You don't have time for getting a boyfriend.

802
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,710
Aunt.

803
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,830
My love fate

804
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,920
got better

805
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,710
after moving out

806
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,880
from my house.

807
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,070
Every new men I meet now

808
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,920
are better

809
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,950
and more reliable than the previous ones.

810
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,560
Right?

811
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,280
I verify that.

812
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,920
Really.

813
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,310
You're smart. She's different.

814
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,350
She's stupid.

815
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,400
It's right.

816
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,190
Let's eat.

817
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,950
Alright, just move.

818
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,950
Move out.

819
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,310
But I'm telling you,

820
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,160
let's set a rule.

821
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,190
Report to me every day.

822
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,160
Every week,

823
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,710
I'll make a spot check.

824
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,920
I think that it's necessary.

825
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
Did you hear that?

826
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,710
Ah, what?

827
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,070
I'm telling you.

828
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,000
Regarding Song Lin's case,

829
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,040
I haven't settle it with you.

830
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,520
I haven't got to the bottom

831
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,230
of this matter.

832
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Mom, about that,

833
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,830
you're mistaken.

834
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,070
Save it! I'm...

835
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,520
I'm mistaken? I'm telling you...

836
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
Fine. Let's not talk about that now.

837
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,160
Okay? You may move out if you want to.

838
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,400
But you'd better send your new address,

839
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,830
your home phone number,

840
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,640
and...

841
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,640
All the houses nowadays
have access control systems.

842
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,590
Right? For the doors?

843
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,560
Send your access code and GPS coordinate

844
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,800
to your dad. All of them.

845
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Understood?

846
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,880
Okay.

847
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,160
Alright then. Let's keep eating.

848
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,830
Look at Qing Qing.

849
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,430
She has already found someone.

850
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,520
By the way,

851
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,430
What does he do?

852
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,400
How old is he?

853
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,800
Let her eat in peace, mom.

854
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,230
No. What's with you? I'm just asking.

855
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,830
So,

856
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,880
Is he from around here?

857
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,230
We talked about that earlier on.

858
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,070
I don't mean to keep this from you.

859
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,640
But I didn't elaborate on it either.

860
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,560
Just put them here.

861
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,000
Let's take the rest

862
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,310
off the truck,

863
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,110
and then carry them upstairs.

864
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,680
Alright.

865
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,110
Okay. Thank you.

866
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,710
Luo Luo, get up. It's time for breakfast!

867
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,520
Are you alright?

868
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,310
It's you. What a coincidence.

869
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,920
Is it a coincidence?

870
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,760
Don't you know that I live here?

871
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,470
Are you coming to meet me?

872
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,590
Don't flatter yourself.

873
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,710
I come here for my friend.

874
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,830
Do you have a friend who lives here?

875
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,640
Who?

876
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,800
None of your business.

877
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,880
To visit a friend,

878
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
why did you buy so many things?

879
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,280
What? You even bring a pillow.

880
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,430
They are all on discounts, so why not?

881
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,830
Good at saving money.

882
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,040
Song Luo.

883
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,110
Song Luo.

884
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,640
Do you really know

885
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,680
Lu Na?

886
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Yeah.

887
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
Are you two close?

888
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,920
We're all right.

889
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,230
It seems like you do know her,

890
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,920
Or else why would she

891
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,800
treat you to dinner?

892
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,710
Luo Luo,

893
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,230
Can you ask her

894
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,680
for an autograph for me?

895
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,800
I want one too.

896
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,950
I like her very much.

897
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,070
She recently took part

898
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,950
in 'Hello, Girls',

899
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,160
a charity event to raise awareness.

900
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,800
and educate the public on Young Women's Health.

901
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,680
I've been following her on the news.

902
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,590
She's totally my idol.

903
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,400
My goddess of positivity.

904
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,470
Sure. No problem.

905
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,430
I'll get her autographs for
you when I see her again.

906
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,230
That's a promise.

907
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,710
It's a promise.

908
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,640
Why are you so close

909
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,310
with Luna lately?

910
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,830
I'm just putting on a front.

911
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,640
Didn't you see

912
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,470
how much they like her?

913
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,950
Don't worry, my nephew.

914
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,110
I'm still your aunt's supporter.

915
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,800
Miss Luna,

916
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,880
Can I have some
of your headshot photos

917
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
with your autographs?

918
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,000
Sure. No problem.

919
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm telling you.

920
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,710
Many of my classmates

921
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,640
really like you.

922
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,000
They all heard that you'd taken part

923
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,950
in a charity event

924
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,400
to raise awareness about public health.

925
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,710
Oh my God, Zhou Fang!

926
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,920
She has moved here?

927
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,760
Luo Luo, what did you say?

928
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Who has moved here?

929
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,190
It's nothing, Miss Luna.

930
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,520
I'll call you later.

931
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,110
Goodbye.

932
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,710
Sorry.

933
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,400
The number you've called is busy

934
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
at the moment.

935
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,070
Please try again later.

936
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:03,170
[Song Luo]

937
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,070
Hey.

938
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,920
Why do you move into my house?

939
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,680
What? Your house?

940
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,280
Look at the house across the street.

941
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm here. Look here.

942
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,800
What are you up to?

943
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,040
Why do you move into our house?

944
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,710
How is this your house?

945
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,950
Aren't you living across the street?

946
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,190
That house belongs to us as well.

947
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,680
My brother bought that house.

948
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,920
Is she going to become
my sister-in-law for real?

949
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,520
What do you want?

950
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,560
Come in and take a seat.

951
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,320
Why did you conspire with
the real estate agent to trick me?

952
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,470
I don't understand what you're saying.

953
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,150
That house belongs to you.

954
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,670
Why was someone else's name

955
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,670
on the lease?

956
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,870
I bought it for my grandma.

957
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,150
Why couldn't I put
her name on the lease?

958
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,230
She didn't like it here so she
move back to her hometown.

959
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,840
Why did you lower the rent for me?

960
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
It's unoccupied anyway.

961
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,950
Besides, aren't you penniless?

962
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,710
I want to terminate the lease.

963
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,710
I won't give you a refund for the rent.

964
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,080
It's written on the
lease. Didn't you read it?

965
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,040
Why are you

966
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,430
such a petty person?

967
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,430
You lost the fight last time,

968
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:48,950
So you came up with a plan

969
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,800
to make a fool of me, right?

970
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,910
Lady, you're living here.

971
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,710
Are you the one who's
being taken advantage of?

972
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,630
Or is it me?

973
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,390
You suffer a financial loss,

974
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,800
While I lose my dignity.

975
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,840
How much is your dignity worth?

976
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,520
I'll compensate you accordingly.

977
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,600
You can't afford it.

978
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,320
Is that enough?

979
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,840
Close the door for me.

980
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,390
How rude.

981
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,230
What do you want?

982
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,120
You need a remote
control for the curtains.

983
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,320
Don't destroy my stuff.

984
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,430
The remote control is on the TV stand.

985
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,600
No batteries?

986
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,870
You've got to come over
if you want some batteries.

987
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,710
Can't I just yank it by hand?

988
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm amazed.

989
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
About what?

990
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,710
Are you, an unemotional man,

991
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,000
Finally interested in someone?

992
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,280
What are you talking about? Nonsense.

993
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,430
Luna and Zhou Fang.

994
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,670
Which one do you like?

995
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,710
I'm telling you.

996
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,040
Don't hang out with Luna
so much from now on.

997
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,390
It means you like Zhou Fang then.

998
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,320
Now I'm going to deliver

999
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,710
this bad news to Luna.

1000
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,910
Don't cause any trouble.

1001
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,560
Don't you want to process
your thoughts together?

1002
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,150
It's already late.

1003
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,280
Why are you still cleaning the house?

1004
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,430
I saw some cat hair on the floor,

1005
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,630
So I vacuumed the floor.

1006
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,470
Oh, look at the time.

1007
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,560
I have to go now.

1008
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,000
Before you leave,

1009
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,560
are you forgetting

1010
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,600
something?

1011
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,630
I've bought you

1012
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,760
The Unifon face masks that you wanted.

1013
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,120
Your face will be clear
and fair after using them.

1014
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,430
I'll get you more next time.

1015
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,280
You clumsy man.

1016
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,320
Can't you be brighter

1017
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,390
and take the initiative more often?

1018
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,390
Got it.

1019
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,470
Close your eyes.

1020
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,560
Let me handle that.

1021
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,120
Why are there so many cat hair?

1022
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,760
There are some over here as well.

1023
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,870
Okay, it's done.

1024
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,390
Close your eyes again.

1025
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,600
Forget it.

1026
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,950
Hear me out, Qin Qing.

1027
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,470
My allergy occurs periodically.

1028
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,670
A while ago, my roommate had a cat.

1029
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,600
I was fine.

1030
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,390
I thought I'd outgrown the allergy.

1031
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,760
It seems like

1032
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,150
we are not meant to be together.

1033
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,560
You can't break up with me

1034
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,040
because of Coco.

1035
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,320
But I can't abandon Coco

1036
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,630
because of you.

1037
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,870
You...

1038
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,910
There are cat hair
everywhere in my house.

1039
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,280
You should go home.

1040
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,150
I'm going to bed.

1041
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,840
Qin Qing.

1042
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,760
Go home.

1043
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm not angry, really.

1044
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,150
Go home now.

1045
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,760
Or else your allergy will act up again.

1046
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,520
President Song.

1047
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,630
These are the guest designers

1048
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,320
handpicked

1049
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,190
by the company.

1050
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,320
Please take a look at the list.

1051
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,040
I have compiled

1052
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,870
all the details

1053
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,760
and sent to you via email.

1054
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,430
I'll go through the documents later.

1055
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,470
By the way,

1056
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,120
How is the application process?

1057
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,360
The reception has been great.

1058
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,470
It has only been a few days.

1059
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,630
More than 10000 people have signed up.

1060
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,040
But my colleagues

1061
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
who are in charge of
the longlist state that

1062
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,120
many applicants are not

1063
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
qualified enough.

1064
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,630
It's hard to select

1065
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,760
a designer who is qualified

1066
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,470
for the competition.

1067
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,360
We might have to rely
on the guest designers.

1068
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,910
You must vet the applicants thoroughly.

1069
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,760
In the first round, we have to eliminate

1070
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,600
those who simply set up an online store

1071
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,670
and call themselves designers.

1072
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,320
What is it?

1073
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,910
It's nothing.

1074
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,360
Spill it.

1075
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,600
It's about Miss Fang.

1076
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,670
She applied too.

1077
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,710
But her brand

1078
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,760
is new.

1079
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,430
Our vetting process has
to adhere to the standards.

1080
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,670
The quality of the show

1081
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,360
depends on the quality
of the contestants.

1082
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,360
Understood.

1083
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,080
Coco.

1084
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,230
How could someone

1085
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,230
be allergic to you?

1086
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,230
You're so adorable.

1087
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,870
But don't worry.

1088
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Mommy will never abandon you.

1089
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,040
I can get a new boyfriend.

1090
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,360
But you're staying with me

1091
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,190
for the rest of your life.

1092
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,320
Are you hungry?

1093
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,080
Let's go get something to eat.

1094
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,230
My Little Coco.

1095
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,320
Di.

1096
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,280
These are binoculars you asked for.

1097
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,430
I'm putting them right here.

1098
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,800
Okay, auntie.

1099
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,470
By the way, auntie.

1100
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,520
Do we have any more

1101
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,560
self-heating hot pot at home?

1102
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,470
Yes. Why do you ask?

1103
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,080
I want to bring some to school

1104
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,150
for my classmates tomorrow.

1105
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,000
I want to bring different
flavors of hot pots

1106
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,870
for them to taste.

1107
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,600
Sure. They're in the cabinet over there.

1108
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,560
You can pack them up later.

1109
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,150
Okay.

1110
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,320
I can't drive tomorrow
due to the driving restriction.

1111
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,000
I can't take you to school.

1112
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,870
You have to go to school on your own.

1113
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,040
Okay. Understood.

1114
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,150
Goodnight.

1115
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,360
Please open the door.

1116
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,080
Song Lin.

1117
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,390
Song Lin, why didn't you...

1118
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,950
Why didn't you wake me up?

1119
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,800
Why do you sleep on the couch?

1120
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,560
Get up now.

1121
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,080
Quick, get up.

1122
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,080
What time is it?

1123
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,600
The bus has already left.

1124
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,760
My teacher wants me
to head over on my own.

1125
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,630
Get up and take me there now.

1126
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,520
Get up.

1127
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,950
Quick. I'm going to braid my hair first.

1128
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,870
Di.

1129
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,670
Di, you've left home already?

1130
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,910
No.

1131
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,360
You left the binoculars at home.

1132
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,390
You wanted to bring them along, right?

1133
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,840
It's okay.

1134
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,910
I'll bring them to you.

1135
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,520
