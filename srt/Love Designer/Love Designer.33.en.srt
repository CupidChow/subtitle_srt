00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,400
All of you, introduce yourselves.

176
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,480
Hello, Mom. Is there anything?

177
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,240
I've cooked dishes

178
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
for you.

179
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
What time are you coming back to eat?

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm not coming back to eat today.

181
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm eating with my colleagues.

182
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
Lin, what are you doing?

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,680
You're leaving your girlfriend aside?

184
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,920
Okay, okay. I'll come now.

185
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,720
Hurry.

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,640
Lin Lin.

187
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,640
Mom.

188
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,320
Can you hear me?

189
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
I can hear you.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,880
I heard your colleague said just now

191
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
that you brought your girlfriend over?

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,280
No. You heard wrong.

193
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,440
How could I hear it wrong?

194
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,200
I heard it clearly.

195
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Since when have you learned

196
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
to lie now?

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,360
No, Mom. Don't get angry.

198
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Dating is a good thing.

199
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,480
Why you don't want me

200
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,240
to know about it?

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,080
It's not that I don't want you to know.

202
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm just waiting...

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,160
Waiting for an opportunity

204
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,520
to bring her back to meet you.

205
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,800
I think now is a suitable time.

206
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
Okay. Let's stop it for now.

207
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
Send me a picture later

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,920
to have a look.

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,440
I want to see how your girlfriend

210
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,080
looks like.

211
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,640
Okay?

212
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
Okay.

213
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,920
Oh, yeah. I want the photos

214
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
with both of you.

215
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Okay, okay.

216
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,120
I've been to this barbecue restaurant

217
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,680
before.

218
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
We always come here after work.

219
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,600
Really.

220
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
It's where we always gathered.

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
It's rare that all of us can

222
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,680
be here like this today.

223
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
How about we take a photo?

224
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,440
Sure! Come, come!

225
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Come, come.

226
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Don't forget to turn on the beauty mode.

227
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,040
Beauty mode?

228
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,120
Three, two, one.

229
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,600
Okay.

230
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,240
Good.

231
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
Send it to us later.

232
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Let's create a group chat later.

233
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,440
Sure.

234
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,120
Send it in the group chat.

235
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,920
It's very nice.

236
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Come. He's back now.

237
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,320
Come. Again.

238
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,560
Another round.

239
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,160
Here.

240
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
Why do you drink so fast?

241
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah.

242
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
You have to catch up.

243
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,480
Here.

244
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
Here. Bottoms up!

245
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Here, Lin. Have another kebab.

246
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,920
Happy.

247
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Here. Have some.

248
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Have some kebabs.

249
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,400
All thanks to Lin,

250
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,720
we get to gather up.

251
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
Exactly. Let's meet up often.

252
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,880
Work.

253
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
You eat.

254
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,360
I need to pick up...Pick up a call.

255
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Another phone call?

256
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,320
He's off work. Why are there so many phone calls?

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,320
He's a bit busy.

258
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,280
We can eat first.

259
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,760
Hello, Mom.

260
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
I took the photo.

261
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,200
I'll send it to you.

262
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Okay.

263
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,720
Oh, right.

264
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,240
Phone calls even after work?

265
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,920
Don't bother.

266
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,720
Yeah. Don't bother about him.

267
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,360
I'll head over.

268
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,160
Okay.

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,360
Let's drink. Let's drink.

270
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,500
[Sending the photo to his Mum]

271
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,240
Well, that's done.

272
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,280
What are you so busy with?

273
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Nothing.

274
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,880
Who was that?

275
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,960
Kept on calling you.

276
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,000
My mom.

277
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,480
She asked me to go back and eat.

278
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
I told her we're having dinner now.

279
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,760
Let's go. Let's eat.

280
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,560
You're here.

281
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm here to visit you, the lonely one.

282
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
You're only feeding me rice?

283
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,160
Of course, there are dishes.

284
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,640
What do you think Luo Luo is doing?

285
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,800
At this hour,

286
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,720
she's probably having class.

287
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,400
She won't skip class, right?

288
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,400
Probably not.

289
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,040
Di is around. She won't dare to.

290
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,280
But what if Di covers up for her?

291
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
Di has me around.

292
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,560
Di won't dare to.

293
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,360
You want to call her?

294
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,480
Luo Luo is all grown up now.

295
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,600
She's different now.

296
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,280
She has goals and she's conscientious.

297
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,640
If you keep

298
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,400
calling her,

299
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,360
she'll miss you.

300
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,440
Then, she won't get used to

301
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,280
the new environment.

302
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,480
You make it sound as if I'm very important.

303
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,840
In her heart,

304
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,560
of course, you're important.

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Really?

306
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,080
You know what.

307
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,440
Luo Luo is gone.

308
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,840
Di's not at home.

309
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,200
Let's not

310
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,200
stay in separate

311
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,880
houses anymore.

312
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,600
Move over and stay here.

313
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll help you move tomorrow.

314
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
I haven't agreed yet.

315
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,960
It's decided then.

316
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
You can't decide it.

317
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,280
Why not?

318
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I haven't agreed yet.

319
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
I even agreed to you moving over.

320
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,160
why do you disagree?

321
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
Nothing's decided for now.

322
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
I haven't agreed.

323
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,600
Have some rice.

324
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,600
Finish it.

325
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
I ate a lot.

326
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
I said I was going on a diet a few days ago.

327
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,800
And I'm eating so much.

328
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,480
Wu San.

329
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,920
Is something bothering you?

330
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,120
No.

331
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Okay then.

332
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,080
I'll go inside first.

333
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
What are you eating?

334
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,080
HaiDiLao's mini hotpot.

335
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,520
Have you considered?

336
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Consider about what?

337
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,640
Moving over.

338
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
You said you'd think about it at home.

339
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,600
Bro,

340
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,320
we've only separated for one hour.

341
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
One hour, bro.

342
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,280
60 minutes.

343
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,520
3600 seconds.

344
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,560
I don't have time now.

345
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,920
I need to rearrange the entire

346
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,640
experience store plan.

347
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,120
Fine.

348
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,280
Continue your work.

349
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
You'll be sitting here?

350
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,760
Focus on your work. Don't mind me.

351
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,680
With you sitting here,

352
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,560
I can't work.

353
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,280
I don't want to go back

354
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
and stay by myself.

355
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,920
If you don't want to

356
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,760
stay at home by yourself,

357
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,800
you can go jogging downstairs,

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
or drink with your friends,

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,280
or work overtime at the company.

360
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
If you really don't want to

361
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,440
see me,

362
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll wait for you in your room.

363
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,520
If that's the case,

364
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,560
I'll call my mom.

365
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,720
Call her then.

366
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,640
Threatening me with your mom.

367
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,600
What kind of person is this?

368
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,600
I'll make a video call.

369
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,360
Fine. Fine.

370
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,320
I'll go now.

371
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,000
How old are you?

372
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Threatening me with your mom.

373
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
Why threaten me with her?

374
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,760
Hurry and consider about it.

375
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,800
Tell me when you decide.

376
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,359
Zhou Fang.

377
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,359
Why are you here?

378
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,000
You're here. Why can't I?

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Did you follow me?

380
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,200
Who followed you?

381
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,280
That idea you have on your mind.

382
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,319
You want to help me?

383
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,920
There's no other way?

384
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,319
What should we do then?

385
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,960
It's the last day of the art exhibition.

386
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,440
It's now

387
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,359
or never.

388
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,120
You thought of an idea?

389
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,480
I did think of an idea.

390
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,280
But you have to help me.

391
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,360
What's the plan?

392
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Tomorrow night, bring Ling Xi

393
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,000
here.

394
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,600
Just tell her that Lin Yun promised

395
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,840
to give her back the painting.

396
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,160
For real?

397
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,040
Let me tell you

398
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,720
the conflict between

399
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,440
Lin Yun and Ling Xi

400
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
isn't something that can be solved easily.

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
I didn't think over it the whole night

402
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,680
for nothing.

403
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,360
I have my way to win him over.

404
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,640
Wait...What do you plan to do to him?

405
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,640
It's not like what you think.

406
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,400
How to win him over?

407
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,760
Wait for my news.

408
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
Win him over?

409
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,040
No matter how many times you come,

410
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,120
my answer is the same.

411
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,720
You can't have the painting.

412
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,080
I expected that answer.

413
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,120
Then why are you

414
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,800
still here?

415
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,280
Actually, it doesn't matter who

416
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,440
has the painting, right?

417
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
What's important is not the painting,

418
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
but the person in the painting.

419
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,840
Ling Xi

420
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,080
doesn't know you're here, right?

421
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,120
Don't act like

422
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,400
you know a lot about us.

423
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
You don't know anything at all.

424
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,760
Of course, I don't know.

425
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,040
The person who knows you two best

426
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,400
are yourselves.

427
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,040
However,

428
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,760
sometimes,

429
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,880
the people who know each other the best

430
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
may be the furthest from one another.

431
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
What are you trying to say?

432
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,920
Let me think.

433
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,120
Ling Xi's favorite flower is

434
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,200
the blue enchantress.

435
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,720
The date she anticipates the most

436
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,560
is a candlelight dinner with you.

437
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,120
The thing she wants to do the most

438
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,880
is to watch you paint.

439
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,520
Stop it.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,760
Don't tell me

441
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,920
these are just online rumors.

442
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,800
I think...these aren't

443
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,680
baseless rumors.

444
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,720
Most of your paintings

445
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,800
have elements of blue color

446
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
and candlelight.

447
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,520
Paintings don't lie.

448
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,680
Artist Lin.

449
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,240
So what?

450
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,160
Those things

451
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,000
are all

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,880
in the past.

453
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,640
The two of you

454
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,080
keep saying that everything's in the past.

455
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,320
But in your hearts,

456
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,440
nothing has passed.

457
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,960
I think this place is

458
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,880
pretty good.

459
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
If you put a candlelight

460
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,920
and have

461
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,200
have a candlelight dinner there,

462
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,080
the atmosphere should be pretty good.

463
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,640
You can rent this place

464
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,600
for another day, right?

465
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,920
What are you planning to do?

466
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,120
I want to help you two

467
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,360
who refuse to be true to yourselves.

468
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,200
What makes you think

469
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,320
she's willing to see me?

470
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,360
And what makes you think

471
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
I want to see her?

472
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,600
Judging from that painting of yours.

473
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,680
Not just on the internet,

474
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,160
even people at the art exhibition

475
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,480
were discussing

476
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
the person in the painting.

477
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,480
Even your dejected past

478
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,920
got uncovered.

479
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,440
But you have never

480
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,120
denied about it,

481
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,120
or stopped it.

482
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,560
I never go online.

483
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,440
I don't care about

484
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,240
what they say at all.

485
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,800
Not to mention

486
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,240
being controversial leads to more popularity.

487
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,320
Don't say that.

488
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,280
You're not this kind of person.

489
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,640
I think you're just

490
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,960
waiting for Ling Xi to state her stand.

491
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,160
How about this?

492
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,240
Tomorrow, I'll do my best

493
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,360
to bring Ling Xi here.

494
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,400
As for the painting

495
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,960
and whatever you have to talk about,

496
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,920
you two can

497
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
figure it out yourselves.

498
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,920
For some words,

499
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
if you don't say them now,

500
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,640
you might not have

501
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,400
the chance in the future.

502
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,280
I won't disturb you now.

503
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,760
I'll get going.

504
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm here only to convey

505
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,560
Zhou Fang's intention.

506
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,440
She wants to get the painting back
for you.

507
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,480
But

508
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,240
you have to go to the art gallery tomorrow.

509
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,760
Being able to persuade Lin Yun

510
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
to give up that painting.

511
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,080
She's indeed someone who has

512
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,720
caught Su Yu Shan's eye.

513
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,080
How impressive.

514
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,040
Zhou Fang does have

515
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,920
her capabilities.

516
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
Plus, Zhou Fang's designs

517
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,160
are really outstanding.

518
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
And Su Yu Shan

519
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,600
is a boss

520
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,920
with an eye in talents.

521
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,040
So, when they collaborate,

522
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,080
I think both Wan Feng

523
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,280
and Chuang Pin Net

524
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,840
will have a major advancement.

525
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,560
So, if you all want

526
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
to acquire my shares,

527
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,720
now it is the best time.

528
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,040
President Song.

529
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,240
Within a few sentences,

530
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,880
you've recommended

531
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,000
your girlfriend

532
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,600
and brought up the acquisition as well.

533
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,080
But there's one thing

534
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,200
that I'm pretty surprised about.

535
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
Even at this time,

536
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
you still put in a good word

537
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,080
for Su Yu Shan.

538
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,800
I wasn't putting in any good words.

539
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,320
I was just telling the truth.

540
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,840
I know very well about

541
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Wan Feng's potential.

542
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,960
What time tomorrow night?

543
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,440
At 7:00 p.m.

544
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
It must have taken your girlfriend

545
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
some effort in order to

546
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,240
get the painting for me.

547
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,920
This time, I owe her one.

548
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,880
She was also helping me.

549
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,680
But I can tell that

550
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
she honestly

551
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
wants to solve this problem for you

552
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,120
and unties the knot in your heart.

553
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,840
Just a reminder.

554
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,000
Feelings

555
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
can make one lose direction.

556
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,480
So, cherish the moments.

557
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,360
Am I right?

558
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,160
It's okay.

559
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't regret my choices.

560
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,640
Okay. Good.

561
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,800
Pull here a bit more.

562
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,760
Pull it down there.

563
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,160
The light,

564
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
hang it higher.

565
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,280
Yeah.

566
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Does it look good?

567
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,640
OK. OK.

568
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay.

569
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,720
Looks pretty good, right?

570
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,560
This bouquet

571
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,040
came late.

572
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,520
What?

573
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,720
Why do you care about

574
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,640
other people's matter so much?

575
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,840
Why do you care about

576
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,920
me less?

577
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
What do you mean I don't care?

578
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,480
Aren't I caring for you

579
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,600
in another way?

580
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
What are you even jealous of?

581
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,800
I know everything.

582
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,280
Every day, even at home,

583
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,760
you asked for Shen Pei Pei

584
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,920
to gather information about Lin Yun.

585
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,440
My status at home

586
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,480
is going down steeply.

587
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
I can't take it anymore.

588
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,000
Stop pretending.

589
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,680
Let me tell you something.

590
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,600
While looking for information on Lin Yun,

591
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,840
I suddenly feel that

592
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,520
the two of them

593
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,840
don't actually hate each other.

594
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,520
Lin Yun and Ling Xi

595
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,840
are actually in love with each other.

596
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Because Lin Yun had once

597
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
mentioned in an interview that

598
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,200
when he can afford them,

599
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,320
he would definitely

600
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
take the girl that he loves

601
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,240
to a candlelight dinner,

602
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,840
he would

603
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
give the girl that he likes

604
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,120
her favorite flowers.

605
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,320
But when he

606
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,280
could finally afford them,

607
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,000
the girl was

608
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,920
no longer by his side.

609
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,480
If it's really like what you said,

610
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
that painting

611
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,640
means so much to him,

612
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,520
how can you be so sure that

613
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,880
he'll give the painting back

614
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,760
to Ling Xi?

615
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
Because of that painting.

616
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,640
Showing the painting

617
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,960
at his art exhibition

618
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,840
means that he wants

619
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,000
Ling Xi to see it.

620
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,800
Moreover, throughout

621
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,480
the conversation I had with him,

622
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,440
I could feel

623
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
his feelings towards Ling Xi,

624
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
including his love towards her.

625
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,640
I'm clever, right?

626
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
Very clever.

627
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,680
I don't even dare to lie anymore.

628
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,520
Come to think of it, it's funny.

629
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,640
We've been fighting secretly for so long.

630
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,400
In the end, we don't even know

631
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,520
what we were fighting for.

632
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,200
Putting this painting on exhibit...

633
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,720
Even the others

634
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
could tell my intention.

635
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,920
Why did you

636
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,360
choose to run away from it?

637
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
I ran away?

638
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,600
To you,

639
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,480
I've never been able to read your mind.

640
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,600
All the while,

641
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,200
you've always had

642
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,040
a place in my heart.

643
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,320
I've never forgotten

644
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,680
all our memories in the past.

645
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,520
No matter how controversial

646
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,400
the others think of the painting,

647
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
I insisted on exhibiting it.

648
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,600
Because they only care

649
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
about the skill level of the painting,

650
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,960
but not

651
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,160
the importance

652
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
to me.

653
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,200
By now,

654
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,320
what's the point

655
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,360
of you saying all these?

656
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,560
I'm not trying to redeem anything.

657
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
I just want you to know that

658
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,000
the feelings we shared in the past

659
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,760
were all real.

660
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,760
However,

661
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,680
we've misunderstood each other for so long.

662
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Until today,

663
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,480
between the two of us,

664
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
there is only regret.

665
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,160
Thank you.

666
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,160
Ling Xi.

I've stopped

671

holding onto the past.

672
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,880
Lin Yun is also

673
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,760
no longer in my heart.

674
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,360
I hope that from now on,

675
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,080
we can

676
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,280
leave each other alone.

Mister,

684
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,960
please help me

685
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,120
to dispose of the painting later.

686
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,760
You don't want such a nice painting?

687
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
It's a waste to throw it away.

688
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,880
Do anything with it.

689
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,080
It's up to you.

690
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,040
Okay then.

692

paid off.

694
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,960
It was Ling Xi?

695
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,040
See.

696
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,540
[The purchase needs to be rearranged soon.
The buyer needs visible profits]

697
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,120
See, I told you.

698
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,200
Everything's worth a try.

699
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,360
What if you succeed?

700
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,280
Zhou Fang.

701
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,640
After I leave

702
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,480
Wan Feng for good,

703
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,280
I won't be able

704
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,200
to keep leading you.

705
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
I can't keep protecting you anymore.

706
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,680
Are you scared?

707
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,360
I'm not scared.

708
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,520
Although you left Wan Feng,

709
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,640
you'll always

710
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,400
be by my side, won't you?

711
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,160
I'll always be by your side.

712
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
I'll always keep you company.

713
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Our aims are the same.

714
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,840
Right?

715
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,840
That won't change easily,

716
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,360
right?

717
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,720
Thank you.

718
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,800
Why are you so corny all of a sudden?

719
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,760
Why not be more practical?

720
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,880
More practical...Okay.

721
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
But it's a bit hard for me now.

722
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,800
Look, I lost my shares,

723
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
I lost my company,

724
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,880
and no one is paying my salary.

725
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,240
Developing new technology

726
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,360
means all expenses and no income.

727
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,320
In the days to come, it'll be hard.

728
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
I need to be frugal from now on.

729
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,640
But I won't mistreat you.

730
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,400
How about this?

731
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,200
I'll move to your house.

732
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,080
What face is that? Inconvenient?

733
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,440
If it's inconvenient, it's fine.

734
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,480
Move to my house then.

735
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,080
It's convenient for me.

736
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,000
No.

737
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,760
I need my personal space.

738
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,000
Why do you need that?

739
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,800
You have your personal space

740
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,560
in the day every day.

741
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,600
Just be with me at night.

742
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,680
But...

743
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
You can come to visit occasionally.

744
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,080
Can I bring my luggage with me?

745
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,000
No.

746
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,520
Everyone's been saying that Song Lin

747
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,280
has been depressed.

748
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,200
Who knew

749
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,920
he would find

750
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,960
such a promising project so soon?

751
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,880
The rival I set my eyes on

752
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,760
won't be defeated

753
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,600
so easily.

754
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,760
I guess he knows that

755
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,160
we are working on

756
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
the augmented reality (AR) project now.

757
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,880
I feel much at ease now.

758
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,400
You want to win again?

759
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,240
Of course.

760
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,840
Then tell me.

761
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,240
What's the key

762
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,040
to winning this?

763
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,040
Uhm...

764
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,120
Time.

765
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,360
At the technical level,

766
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,600
their innovation and breakthrough

767
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,720
won't lose to us.

768
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,960
The main thing is

769
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,360
the time to launch the product.

770
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,040
The faster one

771
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,880
will have the upper hand.

772
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,600
Understood.

773
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,320
I'll ask the R&D team

774
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,240
to speed up.

775
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,600
I guess shortly

776
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,520
we'll see Song Lin again

777
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,960
in a new field.

778
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
I look forward to it.

779
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,560
This dress

780
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,920
goes better with a

781
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,440
simple bead necklace.

782
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
I've designed one before.

783
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,120
Okay.

784
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,480
Do you still have that necklace?

785
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,840
Yes.

786
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,160
Then you can bring it over.

787
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,120
I'll let that celebrity

788
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,880
have a try.

789
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,280
If she likes it,

790
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,160
she might buy it.

791
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
If the customer likes it,

792
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,200
I can give it to her.

793
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,760
Is she walking the red carpet?

794
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,680
Wearing the jewelry I designed

795
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
on the red carpet

796
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,480
can increase

797
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,320
my exposure.

798
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,000
Sounds good.

799
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,800
The brand can be promoted as well.

800
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,560
Okay. This is done,

801
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,800
We can proceed with the try-on now.

802
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:41,320
Good job.

803
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:43,880
I want to ask you something.

804
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,200
Song Lin asked me to live with him.

805
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,040
I think for the matter of living together,

806
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
you have to consider it very carefully.

807
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
But once two people

808
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,520
start to live together,

809
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,160
it means

810
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,560
there won't be any personal space.

811
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,400
It's scary.

812
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,600
I think so.

813
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,560
When Wu San wanted to live with me,

814
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,760
who was the one

815
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,680
that kept siding with him,

816
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,320
helping him get into my house?

817
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,640
This comes to me

818
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
too soon.

819
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,320
So,

820
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,760
the answer is very obvious.

821
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,080
If you really want to

822
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,640
live with him,

823
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,600
you wouldn't have asked me,

824
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,200
right?

825
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,360
I thought it over.

826
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
When Song Lin and I

827
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,040
are together,

828
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,280
it's either for work

829
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,920
or

830
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,720
for the kids.

831
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Even our dates

832
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,600
are within the residential area.

833
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,160
I really can't recall

834
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,200
our official date...

835
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Whether anything like that

836
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
has ever happened before.

837
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,920
Can't you two just

838
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,040
have a good date

839
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,200
sincerely?

840
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,360
We should.

841
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,440
The finance department said this card

842
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,480
has been with him for too long.

843
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,240
What does that mean?

844
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,600
You made our project

845
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,240
possible,

846
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,040
and got investors.

847
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,280
You deserve this.

848
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,520
The finance department said

849
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,040
this is ordered by President Song.

850
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,159
Hurry and check how much money is inside.

851
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,199
Remember to treat us to a meal.

852
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
President Su, why are you here?

853
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Work inspection.

854
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,199
Please have a seat.

855
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,679
Your studio is pretty nice.

856
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,199
But isn't the location

857
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,960
a bit too far

858
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,760
and inconvenient?

859
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,199
A little bit.

860
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,320
You You, get some water for President Su.

861
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,239
We chose this place

862
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,159
because we didn't have

863
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,800
enough manpower

864
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,440
and we were tight financially.

865
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,080
So we found this place

866
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,920
to settle down.

867
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,840
As for now,

868
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,159
due to increased workload,

869
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,880
everyone has been busy.

870
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,080
So, the matter about finding a new place

871
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,719
was put aside.

872
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,159
And we're still here now.

873
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Just in time that our

874
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,920
haute couture concept store

875
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,680
is opening soon,

876
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,560
you can look for

877
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,440
a more spacious space

878
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,680
and move your studio over.

879
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,960
It'll be more convenient that way, right?

880
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,600
Yes.

881
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,920
Actually, I was thinking about that.

882
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,560
So I've been

883
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,360
looking at a few places.

884
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,600
Can I have a look?

885
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,080
Of course.

886
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,600
Thank you.

887
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,720
These few

888
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,200
are the ones that I've been looking at recently.

889
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
I was initially planning to

890
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,440
view the places first

891
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,600
and then report to the company.

892
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,600
I never thought President Su

893
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,560
would come here in person.

894
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,760
You can have a look at it now.

895
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
Are all of them here?

896
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes.

897
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,120
Zhou Fang.

898
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,160
This concept store

899
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,280
is our first store.

900
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,640
You need to consider

901
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,960
the experience of high-end customers too.

902
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
The location is very important.

903
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,080
Are you trying to

904
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,280
cut the cost for Wan Feng?

905
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,680
I did consider

906
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,840
it before.

907
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,880
Because the company

908
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,360
has trusted me so much

909
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,480
and supported me.

910
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,840
I'm already very grateful.

911
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,520
I shouldn't take advantage of your kindness.

912
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,920
So, I thought

913
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,840
to find somewhere further out.

914
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,000
Although these places

915
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,040
are slightly further,

916
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,000
but they're more spacious.

917
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,560
The subway is going to operate next year as well.

918
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,400
So I think

919
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,760
the customers won't be fewer.

920
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,240
How about this?

921
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,520
Let me think of something for you.

922
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,400
Sure.

923
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,560
Thanks President Su for your kind attention.

924
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,360
You're welcome.

925
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,160
Lin, I can't accept this money.

926
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,360
What do you mean? Too little?

927
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Lin, don't tease me.

928
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,400
With my current salary,

929
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,200
I'll have to work for 10 years

930
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,280
to earn the amount inside.

931
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,640
I'll be clear with you.

932
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,360
This money

933
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,440
is for

934
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,600
introducing the project to me.

935
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
You introduced the project to me.

936
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
You handled it.

937
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,880
This money isn't a reward,

938
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
but a remuneration.

939
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,480
You're my boss

940
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,640
and my friend.

941
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,400
I introduced the project to you

942
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,960
as a friend.

943
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,000
You even entrusted

944
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,080
the project to me

945
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,560
and let me see where the future lies.

946
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,440
That is a huge reward.

947
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,480
I can't take this money.

948
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,080
I don't care

949
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,240
what your identity is.

950
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm the boss. I'm the investor.

951
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,480
I invest it and you work for it.

952
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,360
I pay you. This is the rule.

953
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,280
Understand?

954
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,680
Don't break the rule.

955
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,040
Take the money and leave.

956
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
You don't have a job now

957
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,400
and your shares aren't sold yet.

958
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,960
You're still short of money.

959
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,240
You're worried about me?

960
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,000
Do I need you to be worried?

961
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
If you really don't want to take it,

962
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,360
how about this?

963
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,240
You take 70% of the money,

964
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,480
the remaining 30%,

965
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,040
I'll convert them into the company's shares.

966
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,920
How about that?

967
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,640
Lin.

968
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,760
No matter what's the plan,

969
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,920
you're still thinking for me.

970
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,720
It's decided.

971
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,400
Stop being stubborn.

972
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,160
Take the money and leave.

973
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,920
If you have the time,

974
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,040
keep an eye on the project.

975
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,120
Hurry. Go.

976
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,920
Thank you, Lin.

977
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,640
If there isn't anything,

978
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,880
don't come and bother me. Leave.

979
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Here, please.

980
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,240
How is it? Is it alright?

981
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,640
It's really good. Very big.

982
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,800
Yes, it's very spacious.

983
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,720
It's near the financial street.

984
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,400
And it will help

985
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,880
your future development.

986
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
Is this your property previously?

987
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,400
Yes.

988
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,200
I really liked it here before.

989
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,560
so I bought it.

990
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,560
But I couldn't find

991
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,520
a suitable tenant.

992
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,360
So it was left vacant.

993
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,120
It looks very clean here.

994
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,640
You didn't leave it idle all the while.

995
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,480
I always ask the staff

996
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
to come and clean the place.

997
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,600
When I'm free,

998
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,680
I'll come and have a look too.

999
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,400
That's nice.

1000
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,280
Come.

1001
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,960
What was this place

1002
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,800
used for before?

1003
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,960
To be frank with you, previously,

1004
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,480
this was a fashion studio.

1005
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,680
Because of some reasons after that,

1006
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,160
it closed down.

1007
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,120
That area is pretty good,

1008
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,320
because I think it has

1009
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,200
the most privacy

1010
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,680
of the areas.

1011
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,400
You can design it into

1012
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,480
a lounge for VIPs

1013
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
It is private enough .

1014
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
This area in the middle

1015
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,600
is broad and has good lighting.

1016
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,480
You can use it as your

1017
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,280
display area,

1018
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,920
so your garments

1019
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
can be spread out.

1020
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,120
And then,

1021
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,560
the area at the back

1022
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,960
is relatively quiet.

1023
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,080
You don't have to partition it.

1024
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,840
You can have your garment creation process

1025
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,320
open for viewing.

1026
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,840
This way,

1027
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,280
the customers can experience it.

1028
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,640
It's haute couture after all.

1029
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,200
Right?

1030
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,760
Yes.

1031
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,200
Alright.

1032
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,480
I'll leave this place to you.

1033
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,960
You don't have to follow my advice.

1034
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,320
You can

1035
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,520
design it as you like.

1036
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,600
Thank you, President Su.

1037
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,600
You thought about everything.

1038
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,000
It's my pleasure.

1039
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,160
Why is there a puppy here?

1040
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,920
I like it, so I keep it.

1041
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,600
So cute.

1042
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,400
Go and have fun.

1043
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Go and have fun. Go and have fun.

1044
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Let's have some coffee.

1045
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,440
Sure.

1046
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,920
Be good.

1047
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,360
Mr Zuo, you're here again.

1048
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,560
Mr Zuo,

1049
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,800
what good food did you bring this time?

1050
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,920
A handmade bento

1051
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,760
for your Miss Qing.

1052
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,840
Pay attention to your facial expression.

1053
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,840
Right.

1054
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,280
Turn the ring

1055
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,200
a little bit more.

1056
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,520
Move a little bit more.

1057
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,320
Okay.

1058
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,120
Good.

1059
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,520
I didn't see you.

1060
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,640
You don't need to work?

1061
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,880
I have work.

1062
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,040
It's my rest time,

1063
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,080
so I brought some good food for you.

1064
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,320
Thanks, sweetheart.

1065
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,960
Let's eat there.

1066
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,560
It'll get cold later.

1067
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,400
You keep shooting, okay?

1068
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,680
Okay.

1069
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,480
I'll go and get something to eat.

1070
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,480
Thanks for your hard work.

1071
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,440
Sit.

1072
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,400
Oh, right.

1073
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,200
My dad's going to be discharged soon.

1074
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,480
That's great!

1075
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,560
I'll go with you to

1076
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,440
pick Uncle up by then.

1077
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
You don't want me

1078
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,200
to go with you?

1079
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,280
No.

1080
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,320
Of course, I want you to.

1081
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,120
But...

1082
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,600
To be honest,

1083
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,960
my dad likes you.

1084
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,480
But my mom...

1085
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,160
Maybe she thinks that we're

1086
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,920
not suitable for each other.

1087
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,840
I still don't know

1088
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,720
how to tell her.

1089
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,920
So, you're

1090
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
worried about this.

1091
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,680
Although my dad's health

1092
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,520
has got better,

1093
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,320
but...

1094
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
I still need to consider

1095
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,880
their thoughts.

1096
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I can't be as ignorant

1097
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,640
as how I was before.

1098
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,920
You're right.

1099
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,600
Leave it to me.

1100
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,920
I'll handle it nicely.

1101
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,040
Here.

1102
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,080
Eat.

1103
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,160
What did you make?

1104
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,400
They're all dishes that you like.

1105
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,280
It tastes good.
