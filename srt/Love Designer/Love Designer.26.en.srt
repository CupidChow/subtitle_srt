130
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,720

132
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,520
Because you're new, right?

133

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
I've already told you,

175
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,640
I don't accept it.

176
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,520
I will never accept it.

177
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,520
It's really so much effort

178
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
to talk to you.

179
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,920
Miss Fang, you came on time.

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,560
Take a look at this.

181
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
This is from the first design team,

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,160
the revised drafts for

183
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,360
the plants dyeing series.

184
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,640
By the way,

185
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
the thing with the factory in Suzhou,

186
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,520
Miss Izumino and I need to

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,280
go and have a look at their progress,

188
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
we're departing now.

189
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,560
Now?

190
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,880
Take care.

191
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,720
Thanks.

192
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,440
No problem, no problem.

193
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,080
Miss Fang,

194
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,040
this is the new product preview

195
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,800
to be posted on the platform

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,480
tomorrow.

197
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
They said they will promote it

198
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,720
on the homepage,

199
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,360
Take a look

200
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,160
if there are any issues.

201
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
Good. The color palette looks good too.

202
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,840
You You,

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,880
contact some

204
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,240
current popular internet celebrities

205
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
and discuss with them

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,000
about collaborations.

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Then send them

208
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,960
some of our mainstream outfit.

209
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,280
Okay, I'll deal with it now.

210
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,360
Hello.

211
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,360
What are you doing?

212
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,799
I'm at the workshop.

213
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,760
Seeing everybody so busy,

214
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,080
I feel very nervous.

215
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,520
What if everyone...

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Don't worry.

217
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,080
It's impossible for all

218
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,040
to like your designs,

219
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,560
right?

220
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,760
How do you know

221
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,400
what I'm thinking?

222
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,400
Just your little thoughts,

223
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,760
how could I not know?

224
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
How smart.

225
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
Then, guess again what I am

226
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
thinking right now.

227
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,480
Thinking about me, of course.

228
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
So confident?

229
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,800
I'm telling you,

230
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
after this period,

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm going to visit your father,

232
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,240
rope him in on my side and bootlick him,

233
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
which is good for me.

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
You'd better not bootlick him.

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
My father hates it

236
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,920
when people try to flatter him.

237
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
I'll talk to my father about you.

238
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,080
We've faced

239
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
so many problems before,

240
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,160
now things will only

241
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,280
proceed toward a good way.

242
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,200
Don't worry, it will get better.

243
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Go back to your work.

244
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll hang up.

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,880
Bye-bye.

246
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
Bye-bye.

247
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,480
Could you guess

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
what I am thinking now?

249
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,080
You want to die, I presume?

250
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,480
As an assistant of a president,

251
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
I believe after sorting out

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,920
work-related matters,

253
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,880
what's more important is to always

254
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
care about the president's

255
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,520
daily life

256
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
and make necessary plans for him.

257
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,760
This is the professionalism

258
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,960
an assistant should have.

259
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,160
As it is said,

260
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,760
everyone will have his own strengths.

261
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,240
If you have issues

262
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,960
with relationship,

263
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
I can help you at any time.

264
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,880
Okay, the data collection is done.

265
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
The 3D measurement method

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
not only has high requirements on the hardware,

267
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,760
but the software algorithm is also critical.

268
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
At present, after the programming upgrade,

269
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,520
we have added 3 data points

270
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,720
to the measurement of the size.

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,160
The next focus of work

272
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,800
will be transferred to

273
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,080
the development of infrared scanning

274
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,120
to replace the traditional

275
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,720
camera technology

276
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,920
to improve accuracy.

277
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
There's no problem with the hardware.

278
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,640
I believe in you all.

279
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
There's one thing though,

280
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
the protection of the big data

281
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
and the security of the user information

282
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,320
must be done perfectly,

283
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,160
understood?

284
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,000
Understood.

285
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,440
Lin,

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
in the aspect of the augmented reality fitting,

287
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,200
we have a problem

288
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,280
that needs your help.

289
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,040
Go ahead.

290
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,960
In modelling,

291
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,680
we need a

292
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,600
professional fashion designer

293
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,720
to co-operate with us.

294
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
This way, they will know more

295
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,520
about the fabric of the clothing.

296
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,400
Besides, the size adjustments

297
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
will also be more user-friendly.

298
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,520
OK.

299
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
I'll go back and

300
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,560
send a designer

301
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,880
to help you with that.

302
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,680
That's it, thanks for your hard work.

303
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,680
Okay, President Song.

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,840
Then, I'll go to work on my stuff.

305
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,440
Go ahead.

306
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,240
Xiao Fei,

307
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,240
is there anything else

308
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
funny here?

309
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,560
Show me.

310
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,240
Okay, let me

311
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,080
show you black technology.

312
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,800
Lin,

313
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
I think we don't have to

314
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,480
avoid families when recommending talents.

315
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
In my opinion, why not

316
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
ask Miss Fang to handle this?

317
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,080
S many designers are in the company,

318
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,520
why do you have to pick Zhou Fang?

319
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,120
Because you two know each other?

320
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,800
It's not about being close or not,

321
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I know her.

322
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,120
First of all, Miss Fang

323
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
has no problem

324
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,480
in her profession.

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
And she's very dedicated.

326
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,480
If we get a new

327
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,640
designer over,

328
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
we need time to work together.

329
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,800
Isn't it too much trouble?

330
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,920
Zhou Fang's studio

331
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,520
just got on track.

332
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
She's leading such a big team

333
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
all by herself,

334
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,440
she's already so tired.

335
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,160
Everybody's energy has a limit.

336
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm afraid that sending her here

337
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,280
will delay your progress.

338
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,520
I think you're just afraid

339
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,480
we would tire her out

340
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,320
and obstruct

341
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,280
your dating.

342
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,240
How about this?

343
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,720
After she's done with

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
the shopping festival project,

345
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
I'll talk with her.

346
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,760
Let's go,

347
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,320
I know a restaurant

348
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,800
that's pretty good.

349
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,920
I'll treat you to a meal.

350
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,260
[DeltaHealth]

351
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,280
Dad.

352
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,040
They're gone?

353
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,960
I told uncles that

354
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,080
they don't have to keep coming here.

355
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,840
You're now recovering,

356
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,200
so you need rest.

357
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
You kid,

358
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,080
you're always so straightforward

359
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,040
and quick with your words.

360
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm just telling the truth.

361
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,000
You've been reading it for so long. Stop it.

362
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm not done with it.

363
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,920
You're still like a child.

364
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,480
It's rare that I have a good spirit today.

365
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
It's also rare that

366
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,160
you reported work to me

367
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
so seriously.

368
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,560
Tell me more.

369
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay.

370
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
These few days,

371
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,920
I've been reading the book

372
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,480
that you gave me,

373
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
I was quite inspired.

374
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,040
In fact, what all design categories

375
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,880
have in common

376
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,160
is the pursuit and

377
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,200
realization of vitality.

378
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,280
The so-called vitality

379
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
is simply

380
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,080
the design idea.

381
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,520
Take wedding rings as an example,

382
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
The Archduke

383
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
Maximilian of Austria

384
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,200
fell in love with

385
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,080
Princess Mary of France.

386
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,760
So, he inserted a diamond

387
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,920
into the metal

388
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,080
as a wedding ring to propose to the princess.

389
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,600
Actually, from the beginning,

390
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,320
the wedding ring should be
injected with emotions

391
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,040
instead of being a cold metal ring.

392
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,080
For ornamental jewelry,

393
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,880
you can choose

394
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,920
the most beautiful style,

395
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,520
but a wedding ring

396
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
should be injected with

397
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,040
the truest emotions for customization.

398
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,800
Although it's not perfect,

399
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
as long as you persist in your heart,

400
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
you will definitely
gain something in return.

401
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,040
If you need anything,

402
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,840
just tell me.

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,240
Okay.

404
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,440
Hello, what's wrong?

405
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,920
Hello, what are you doing?

406
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm in a meeting.

407
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,840
Then you should hang up.

408
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,880
It's fine.

409
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,000
Tell me what's matter.

410
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,560
Nothing.

411
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,680
I'm off work soon.

412
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,640
So, I want to

413
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
invite you for a meal later.

414
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,800
I don't think I can make it today.

415
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,200
I'll be busy until late at night.

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,160
Alright then.

417
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,160
I'll look for Qin Qing

418
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,840
and Pei Pei.

419
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,320
Okay, you go ahead, I'll get the bill.

420
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,040
Bye.

421
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,800
Miss Fang.

422
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,000
Here you are.

423
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,040
Have you ordered?

424
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,920
Not yet.

425
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
How dare we order without you?

426
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,720
Just order, I have a mission today.

427
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,440
What mission?

428
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,760
This meal is on Song Lin.

429
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
Come, Pei Pei, you do the ordering.

430
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,520
Me?

431
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,280
Only order the expensive ones,
not the right ones.

432
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,800
Okay!

433
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,560
Are you still angry at him?

434
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,400
I have to let him remember this lesson.

435
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,240
If he ever hurts you again,

436
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
I really won't go easy on him

437
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,440
the next time.

438
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,360
It was settled last time,

439
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
wasn't it?

440
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,680
Besides, it was a misunderstanding,

441
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,800
stop being angry, okay?

442
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,360
You're already

443
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,400
siding with outsiders,

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
dates before mates.

445
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,280
The one I love the most is still you.

446
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,800
If you're still angry,

447
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,640
I'll go back and beat him.

448
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,760
This is more like it.

449
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,800
Your phone call.

450
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,620
[Huo Chen Dong]

451
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,600
Hello?

452
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm eating with Zhou Fang and the other one.

453
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,480
Okay,

454
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,520
I'll go and meet you in a while.

455
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,920
Anything

456
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,640
good to eat?

457
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,440
Miss Qing,

458
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,640
Why are you bringing me

459
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,240
here at night?

460
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
You'll know it in a while.

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Huo Chen Dong,

462
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,160
how come he's here?

463
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,480
What are you scared of?

464
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,319
I haven't thought how to

465
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,400
apologize to him.

466
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,960
He already said that day

467
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,839
he didn't want to see me,

468
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,800
yet I'm here now.

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
Why are you so useless?

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm here with you,
what are you scared of?

471
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:15,960
Let's go.

472
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,119
Let's go.

473
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
Senior.

474
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,119
We're here.

475
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,480
Why is she here?

476
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,440
I drank a little alcohol just now,

477
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,440
so she sent me here.

478
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,120
This is a proposal for you,

479
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,840
I was thinking

480
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,720
to give it to you tomorrow.

481
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,040
Take it back and have a look,

482
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
if there's any problem,

483
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,640
contact me anytime.

484
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,800
If there's nothing else,
I'm bringing it back.

485
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,040
Senior,

486
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,960
I have a lot of questions

487
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,720
to ask you,

488
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
a lot of questions.

489
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,040
Besides, it's hard to

490
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,080
explain on the phone.

491
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,280
Why don't we

492
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,000
go to a coffee shop now,

493
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,080
sit down and discuss it?

494
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
Coffee shop, but my dog...

495
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Let me walk your dog,

496
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
I love dogs.

497
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,320
It took me so much effort

498
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,600
to create this chance for you two,

499
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,280
why are you...

500
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,600
You didn't say it earlier.

501
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,560
I thought you two

502
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
wanted to discuss financing.

503
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,760
You're really, so dumb.

504
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,320
Never mind, next time then.

505
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,120
Let's go then.

506
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,880
It's a bit scared of strangers,

507
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,960
sorry to trouble you.

508
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,280
Its name is Lucca,

509
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,760
and it's good at running away without the strap,

510
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
so you must hold the strap well.

511
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,800
Count on me.

512
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,840
We're going.

513
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,280
Okay.

514
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,240
Be good.

515
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm off now, Lucca.

516
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
Look, it can't bear to leave you.

517
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,720
Lucca.

518
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,480
Come, come. Lucca, don't be scared.

519
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,840
Did I scare you?

520
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,480
Why are you here?

521
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,200
I'm here to see you,

522
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,080
see if you're

523
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,320
really working overtime

524
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,440
or dating behind my back.

525
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
What are you thinking?

526
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,600
How could I have a date behind your back?

527
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,120
Have a date with me then.

528
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,360
How?

529
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,520
Come with me.

530
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,240
That's a lot,

531
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,680
you didn't make them yourself, right?

532
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,520
Of course not.

533
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,080
I went to your favorite

534
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
restaurant and bought them.

535
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,440
I know you must be tired

536
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,200
from working overtime,

537
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
so I bought so much.

538
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,120
You must finish them all.

539
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,440
Alright.

540
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,480
Cheers for your night of working overtime!

541
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Why are you looking at me?

542
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,400
Because I like you.

543
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
Come, let's take a picture together.

544
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay, Lucca?

545
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:53,960
Come.

546
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,480
Come.

547
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,600
Be careful.

548
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm so sorry.

549
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,680
It's okay, it's okay, little kid.

550
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,400
Don't cry, don't cry.

551
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,080
Don't cry, stop crying okay?

552
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,680
What's wrong?

553
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,720
Are you hurt?

554
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,120
Luckily, she's not hurt.

555
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,240
Okay,

556
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,440
don't cry, don't cry.

557
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,640
Okay? Let's go home, let's go home.

558
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
Let's go, let's go, we're going home.

559
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,080
Be careful next time.

560
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,520
Let's go home.

561
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,920
Pick up the ball.

562
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,480
Go home with your mum.

563
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,520
Let's go home. Don't cry.

564
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,000
Thank you!

565
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,680
It's fine.

566
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,120
Are you okay?

567
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,480
Where's the dog?

568
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,400
Lucca.

569
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,800
Hi, excuse me.

570
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,920
Have you seen

571
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,560
this dog?

572
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,040
Sorry, I haven't seen it.

573
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,640
I have not seen it.

574
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,760
Hello,

575
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,080
have you seen

576
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,000
this dog?

577
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,480
I think it went that way.

578
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
Okay, thank you.

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,080
Lucca.

580
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,240
Lucca.

581
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,520
Lucca.

582
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,880
Lucca.

583
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,040
Her phone is still off.

584
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,720
Where on earth did she go?

585
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,840
How can she lose herself

586
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
by walking a dog?

587
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,880
Let's split up and find her.

588
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,480
Okay.

589
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,760
I'll go this way.

590
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,400
Where's Lucca?

591
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,640
I'm so sorry,

592
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,880
I lost Lucca.

593
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm sorry.

594
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,000
It's alright,

595
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,720
you should go back first.

596
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
Lucca, Lucca.

597
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,920
It's done,

598
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,440
don't make it wet

599
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,320
when you take a shower these days.

600
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,000
Stop crying,

601
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,840
it's already happened.

602
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,400
Even if you cry your eyes out,

603
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,080
nothing will change.

604
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,680
It's all my fault,

605
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,640
I was just thinking of

606
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,560
giving you two a chance,

607
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,960
who knew it would go that way.

608
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,280
It's my fault,

609
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,240
I'm too stupid.

610
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,040
Miss Qing,

611
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,440
do you think

612
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,760
someone really kidnapped

613
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,000
his dog?

614
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
Of course not, stop thinking too much.

615
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,400
God bless,

616
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,600
bless the dog to return home safely.

617
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,840
Please, please don't let it

618
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,640
meet any bad people,

619
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,040
please.

620
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,960
The little brat is very smart,

621
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
it knows where its house is.

622
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,040
It'll surely know how to go back.

623
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
Last time, my Coco

624
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,520
also went lost

625
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,960
like this,

626
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,800
but after two days

627
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,720
it came back itself.

628
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,480
Really?

629
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,200
As for Chen Dong,

630
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,880
when the owner lost his pet,

631
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,440
he would be worried.

632
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,000
Am I right?

633
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,000
He won't blame you,

634
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,280
don't think too much.

635
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,200
See,

636
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,320
he bought these

637
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,920
medicines for you.

638
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Miss Qing,

639
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
could you call him again

640
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,520
and ask if the dog

641
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,560
went back already?

642
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,960
Okay, let me call him again.

643
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,400
Chen Dong,

644
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,040
how is it? Has the dog gone back?

645
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,400
Don't be too worried.

646
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,080
Okay.

647
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,600
Alright, alright, don't cry.

648
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,286
[Lost Dog]

649
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,680
President Zhou.

650
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,120
How is it?

651
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,120
For the shopping festival,

652
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm still worried that

653
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,640
logistics will be delayed.

654
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,880
The solution is

655
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,640
on the table,

656
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,440
you should take a look at it.

657
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,320
Okay.

658
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,880
You You, how's things on your side?

659
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,920
Have you contacted Wan Feng?

660
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,280
No worries, everything is settled.

661
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,760
Okay, arrange them according to their styles.

662
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,320
Okay.

663
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,080
How's the marketing?

664
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,240
Don't worry,

665
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,480
I've arranged everything that we can do.

666
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,440
The rest is up to today,

667
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,880
whether the buyers on Chuang Pin Net

668
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,760
would favourite us

669
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
or place orders during the shopping festival.

670
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,080
Keep it up, it's up to you now.

671
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay, be at ease.

672
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
Why are you here?

673
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm here to check.

674
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,640
I'm still a bit worried.

675
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,000
How's the marketing?

676
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,560
It's going well.

677
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,080
With the new media and internet celebrities,

678
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,960
You You and Kai Kai have already

679
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,120
done the necessary marketing.

680
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,400
So, it all depends on the

681
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,120
situation after this.

682
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,200
I've taken a look at it,

683
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,720
the coverage is not enough,

684
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,960
You need to increase the coverage.

685
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Shen Pei Pei has already helped me with

686
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,320
some marketing.

687
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,680
If we want to increase it,

688
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
we have to wait for another half an hour.

689
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,080
If all else fails,

690
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,480
I'll let the marketing department

691
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
help me promote,

692
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,920
see if there are any

693
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
new solutions.

694
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,320
It'll be too late.

695
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,080
Chen Chen.

696
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,720
Contact the company

697
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,600
and tell them that

698
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,000
all the marketing channels today

699
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,400
will be reserved for them.

700
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,240
Okay, boss. Right away.

701
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,800
You You, I still have some clothes
to be carried in,

702
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,640
give me a hand, will you?

703
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,080
Okay, okay, okay.

704
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,800
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

705
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,360
You all come and help me too.

706
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,160
Come on, come on.

707
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,040
Go, go, go.

708
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Whether the diversion is successful,

709
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,600
the next two hours is the key.

710
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,240
Thank you.

711
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,000
Five.

712
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Four.

713
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,640
Three.

714
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,720
Two.

715
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,040
One.

716
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,440
It's online.

717
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,320
It's online, it's online, it's online.

718
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,680
The traffic is increasing.

719
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,400
It's going up, it's going up.

720
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,080
Let me see.

721
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,840
With the promotion on the home page,

722
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
the result is really different.

723
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,440
Look, there's an order.

724
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,960
There's an order.

725
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Look.

726
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,680
Dress number nine.

727
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,760
Small size one piece, small size one piece.

728
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,440
Fast, fast, fast.

729
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,080
Don't forget the gift.

730
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,000
Free gift is the scarf.

731
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,560
Okay.

732
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,120
It's so fast. Now, dress number four.

733
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,840
Small size one piece and
extra large size one piece.

734
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,360
I'll deal with that.

735
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,160
Don't forget the gift.

736
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,480
Okay.

737
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,520
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

738
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,480
That's good.

739
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,240
Is this some

740
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,160
special treatment for me?

741
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,040
You don't want it?

742
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,400
Of course, I want it.

743
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,920
Manager, you're here.

744
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,000
Here are some fabrics

745
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,640
for President Zhou's company.

746
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
Please sign here.

747
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,760
What's this smell?

748
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,840
Why is the smell of it

749
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,520
so heavy?

750
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,120
Did you check it when

751
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,760
you receive the stock?

752
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,640
I checked.

753
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,240
It's probably because of the cloudy days,

754
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,920
so the fabric is a little damp.

755
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,520
Could it be that they're moldy?

756
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,120
Manager, don't scare me.

757
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,680
It's alright, the problem isn't big.

758
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,280
Send it over first.

759
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Okay, I'll go first, manager.

760
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,080
Why are you here?

761
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,040
Miss Fang.

762
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,640
What's the matter?

763
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,720
I had a meeting nearby,

764
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,600
so I stopped by.

765
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,480
It's so late but you're still working?

766
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,680
It must be hard for you.

767
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,960
It's fine.

768
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,720
Isn't it the shopping festival now?

769
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,360
I want to take this opportunity

770
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,640
to increase turnover.

771
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,000
When it's on track,

772
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,600
it'll be fine then.

773
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,440
You and Qin Qing
won't have to worry anymore.

774
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,520
What? What's wrong?

775
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,680
Nothing.

776
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,680
If it's nothing,

777
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,640
why would you come over yourself?

778
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,720
Spill the beans.

779
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,040
It's about the technology company,

780
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,120
but I see you've already occupied.

781
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
How about I come back later?

782
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,720
You...

783
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,200
no wonder Qin Qing

784
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,040
always complains about you.

785
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,400
Don't hold anything back, tell me.

786
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,080
Miss Fang,

787
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,400
you know that we're doing

788
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,320
the online customization, right?

789
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
The project is running

790
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,920
pretty well now,

791
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,600
but in the fashion part

792
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,560
we lack a

793
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,280
fashion design consultant.

794
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,000
The clothing's size,

795
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,360
material, drape and other characteristics

796
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,440
need to make into data

797
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,600
into the machine.

798
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,480
Okay,

799
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,560
I'll do it.

800
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,960
Don't you have to think it over

801
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,840
before you agree?

802
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,440
Since you're already here,

803
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,240
it means you acknowledge

804
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,920
my capabilities

805
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,800
to do this.

806
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,480
And you were

807
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,200
stammering about

808
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,440
without saying anything,

809
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,680
because you're afraid
it would be too hard for me,

810
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,280
Actually, you don't have to feel like

811
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,040
you owe me anything,

812
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,280
because I feel like what you

813
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,480
are doing is meaningful.

814
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,760
So, I'm willing to do it.

815
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,240
Besides, I did some

816
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,040
serious consideration for a while.

817
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,520
I feel that in this project,

818
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,960
we not only have to settle
the finished clothing

819
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,320
online fitting session,

820
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,960
but we also have to deal with

821
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,400
the current body measurement mode,

822
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,320
because if

823
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,400
there is sufficient accuracy,

824
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,600
we could also

825
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,560
customize clothes

826
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,240
for clients from afar.

827
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,720
By then, this would open up

828
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,200
more market opportunities for designers

829
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
and create more choices

830
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,120
for consumers.

831
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,240
This is definitely

832
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,040
a good thing

833
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,080
for our industry.

834
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Miss Fang, how come when this thing

835
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,880
comes out from

836
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,480
you and Song Lin,

837
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,800
it becomes particularly mighty and grand,

838
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
and strategically meaningful?

839
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,960
You two are really made for each other.

840
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,640
In the future, stop calling me Miss Fang,

841
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,720
I'm now a consultant.

842
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,680
Good day, consultant.

843
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:10,431
[Investments on Project AR's Research & Development]

844
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:18,920
Chen Chen.

845
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,680
Hello, President Song.

846
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,880
Find someone

847
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,280
to help me re-calculate the

848
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,600
investment budget for the

849
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,680
augmented reality project.

850
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,720
Is there any problem?

851
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,120
With this kind of project,

852
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,240
we need to bear risks.

853
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,040
Besides, research and development
is a bottomless pit.

854
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,920
We can't limit

855
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,760
the technicians

856
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,600
just because of

857
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,440
funding problems.

858
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,160
Find more investors to take part
in this in later stages.

859
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,040
But, once more investors

860
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,760
join the party,

861
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,360
this technology will not only

862
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,240
belong to you anymore.

863
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,720
After the development of

864
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,880
this technology,

865
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,120
we'll have to share it sooner or later.

866
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,480
Besides, the funding

867
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,560
will be intervened anyway.

868
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,960
It's fine,

869
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,840
after the shopping festival,

870
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,320
we'll go about looking for investors.

871
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,040
Okay, no problem.

872
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,920
Okay, we can pack them now.

873
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,760
This is a medium size.

874
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,480
Medium size.

875
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,600
Look at this.

876
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,280
Count them well.

877
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,160
don't make any mistakes.

878
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,520
Don't worry, boss.

879
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,600
Okay, good work.

880
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,240
This is a large size.

881
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,240
Two pieces, right?

882
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:23,960
Okay.

883
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,160
How's the data?

884
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,920
Exactly in half an hour,

885
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,960
the turnover rate has exceeded

886
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,120
last year's one-hour record.

887
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,640
What about the new brand?

888
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,680
Although President Zhou
has the newly created brand,

889
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
the turnover rate

890
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,920
has exceeded a thousand orders.

891
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,080
Good.

892
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
In the regular meeting later,

893
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,360
let everybody voice out

894
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,600
their opinions about the

895
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,240
customization service.

896
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,960
Okay, I'll make the announcement.

897
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,960
Don't tell anyone about the new project.

898
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:06,960
Okay.

899
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:19,960
Hello.

900
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,200
Let me tell you,

901
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,240
don't get excited too soon.

902
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,400
This is a protracted battle.

903
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,120
Then, I want a reward.

904
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Okay,

905
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,120
I'll reward you when I get back.

906
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,280
Alright, let's meet back home.

907
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,363
[Thank you]

908
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,120
[Thank you]

909
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Slow down.

910
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,840
Okay, everything's good here.

911
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Boss, it was a good start.

912
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,800
I feel so satisfied!

913
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Yeah, right?

914
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,520
What do you think,

915
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,400
it feels good, right?

916
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,320
It's great!

917
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,160
Be careful with this.

918
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,520
Okay.

919
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,520
Alright, thank you.

920
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,200
Okay, no worries.

921
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,960
Thank you, good work.

922
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,960
Good work, good work.

923
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,840
Good work, let's go.

924
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,360
Let's go back and continue to work.

925
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,040
Let's go.

926
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
What a coincidence,

927
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
our total sales for two days is

928
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,640
5,200,000 yuan.

929
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,800
520*.
(*520: I love you)

930
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,760
It's true,

931
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,040
it's 520.

932
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, yeah, Miss Fang,

933
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,840
our inventory is

934
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,640
running low.

935
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,600
I'll call the factory to add more.

936
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,320
Manager Wang, so sorry to

937
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,760
disturb you at this time.

938
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,400
I would like to request
for another batch of stock.

939
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,440
Yes, yes, as soon as possible.

940
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,360
Hello.

941
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,120
Is there any instruction
from you, President Song?

942
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,680
I tried so hard

943
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,360
to attract your attention,

944
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
I want to meet you, of course.

945
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,800
You want to see me, why don't you

946
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,920
just come over directly?

947
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,680
You didn't invite me over,

948
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,360
how can I go over?

949
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,760
Dear President Song,

950
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
I wonder if you have

951
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
free time to

952
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,480
visit me at my home?

953
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm coming, I'm coming.

954
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,640
You really don't regard yourself

955
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,760
as an outsider, do you?

956
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,880
What outsider, I'm an insider.

957
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
Do you like the gift I gave you?

958
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,960
What gift?

959
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,000
520.

960
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,120
You bought that?

961
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,040
I bought some of it.

962
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,720
Your total sales

963
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
was originally 4.3 million yuan,

964
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,920
I topped up the rest.

965
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
You have too much money?

966
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm willing to spend for you.

967
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,920
Did you do this in

968
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,680
the previous relationships?

969
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,320
I'm not insane, why should I?

970
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,320
What are you doing?

971
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm calling the accountant,

972
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,160
let her refund the money.

973
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,920
The marketing thing last time

974
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,800
we haven't settled that,

975
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
now we have something new,

976
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,120
how do you want to settle it?

977
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,520
You did it on purpose.

978
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,240
Yes, I did it on purpose.

979
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,120
I want some reward for working hard.

980
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,960
Lucca,

981
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,920
come here, come here, come here.

982
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,000
Where did you go?

983
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,480
It's only been a few days,

984
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,160
you don't know me?

985
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,440
Where did you go?

986
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,520
You must miss it a lot.

987
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,280
I really do. Lucca, good boy.

988
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,200
Here.

989
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,720
Thank you.

990
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,960
For what?

991
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,720
It was me who lost Lucca.

992
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,240
I should apologize.

993
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,040
It's already over.

994
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,240
Right.

995
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
how did you find it?

996
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,760
I put out notices for the dog

997
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,040
in the nearby areas.

998
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,360
I still couldn't find Lucca,

999
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,280
so I kept posting.

1000
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,120
Luck was on my side,

1001
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,040
someone really

1002
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,920
gave me a call.

1003
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,440
Oh, right, how much is the compensation fee?

1004
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,920
I'll pay for it.

1005
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,160
No need,

1006
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,000
the one who found the dog

1007
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,920
was a kind-hearted person,

1008
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,920
he didn't ask for money.

1009
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,520
Then,

1010
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,240
thank you for your hard work.

1011
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
I'll bring it back first.

1012
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,160
Wait a minute.

1013
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,160
Is there anything else?

1014
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,520
Have you eaten dinner?

1015
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,880
Yes, I have.

1016
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,720
Goodbye.

1017
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,280
Goodbye.

1018
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,560
Are you available tomorrow night?

1019
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,520
Yes.

1020
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,720
