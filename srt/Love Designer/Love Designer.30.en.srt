[Episode 30]

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,880
Welcome.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,320
Hello.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,120
These paintings are quite beautiful.

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
But I heard that

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
this artist used to be a penniless nobody.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,199
He only gained recognition

32
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,199
in recent years.

33
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,600
I heard that this artist

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
succeed

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,320
because of a woman.

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,760
But after he became famous,

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
he abandoned that woman.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,160
Yeah.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,240
I heard that

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
it was a messy breakup.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,760
Everyone in the art field knows.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
It had become the butt of the joke.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
Don't you know how to apologize?

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,520
Lin Yun, I know you're here.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
If you're a man,

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,520
get out here

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,680
and talk to me face-to-face.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
How much is this painting?

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,640
I'm buying this.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
It's priceless to me.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,480
You have no right to exhibit it.

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm the artist.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Of course, I have the right to do that.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,320
Is there a problem, Mr. Lin?

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
If there's anything you want to say,

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
we can talk about this in private.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,720
There's no need to

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,680
make a scene.

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,160
Make a scene?

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,000
Weren't the things you have done

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
embarrassing enough already?

62
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,920
Show this lady the door.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,880
Ma'am,

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
this way, please.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,960
You win this time.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,280
Over here.

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,040
Here you are.

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,360
Do I

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
smell of alcohol?

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,200
What's the deal with you?

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,000
I arrived early just now.

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
There was an art gallery next door.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,160
I went to the exhibition

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,640
and ran into a woman.

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
She was arguing with someone.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,200
The wine in my glass spilled onto me.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
She left without apology.

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,400
Such a

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,960
rude person.

80
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,600
Right?

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,640
I wonder why someone like that

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,720
would come to an exhibition.

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Where's the investor we're about to meet?

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,279
She's probably on the way.

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,240
She'll arrive soon.

86
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,079
So unpunctual.

87
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,839
Is this person reliable?

88
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
Yes, she is.

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,000
Over here.

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,840
Hi.

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,080
Um,

92
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,400
sorry about what happened just now.

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,280
I was being rude.

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
It's nothing.

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,880
By the way,

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,400
are you alright?

97
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Let's just talk about work.

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,880
Do you two know each other?

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,680
We met just now.

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,520
Oh, right.

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,000
I haven't formally introduced you to

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
each other.

103
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,000
This is President Song, a shareholder

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,800
of Wan Feng Group.

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
This is President Ling,

106
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,080
the representative of the investor.

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,120
Nice to meet you.

108
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,960
I wanted

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
to let you two formally meet

110
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,000
each other today.

111
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,960
Who would've thought

112
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
you two have already met.

113
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,720
Indeed.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
It must be fate, making

115
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,360
us meet like that.

116
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,400
Yes, it must be fate.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,320
The odds of you

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
closing the deal is high.

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
I think I need some time

120
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
to consider this deal,

121
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,920
concerning the share

122
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,000
or President Song

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
as a person.

124
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,760
Is there a problem?

125
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,880
No, nothing.

126
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,800
I just think that

127
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
you're

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,760
quite professional at work.

129
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
But you're completely different

130
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
outside of work.

131
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,880
What do you mean?

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,280
If you're as cool-headed

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,480
as you're now in daily life,

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,160
you'll certainly

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,040
get that painting.

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,040
Are you complimenting me

137
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,520
or trying to comment something

138
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,200
indirectly?

139
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
No, I'm not.

140
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
but I'm certainly not complimenting you.

141
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,000
No, no.

142
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,600
President Song is someone who

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,240
really, really

144
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
likes to joke.

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Okay, I don't have much time.

146
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,240
Let's talk about the project.

147
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,240
Sure.

148
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,520
President Su.

149
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,320
Have fun.

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,280
President Su.

151
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,360
President Su.

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,840
Hi.

153
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Hi, President Su.

154
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,360
President Su.

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,520
Enjoy the party.

156
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,000
President Su.

157
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,440
This dress is very beautiful.

158
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
Did you design it yourself?

159
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,560
Yes.

160
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,520
Do you want a drink?

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
It's okay. I can get it myself.

162
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,640
Cheers.

163
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,960
President Su.

164
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,760
Was it you

165
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
who introduced me for the project to make

166
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,880
evening suits for the male idol group?

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah.

168
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,880
We're

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,800
business partners.

170
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Consider it as a

171
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
gesture of good faith from me.

172
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
I wonder what President Su sees in me

173
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,960
that makes you want to

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,440
collaborate with me.

175
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
I admire your talent

176
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
and boldness.

177
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,200
I wish the best for our

178
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,760
partnership.

179
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,280
By the way,

180
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,280
I've read your business

181
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,880
plan.

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,880
You want to

183
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,080
start an haute couture concept store,

184
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,600
right?

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
I indeed thought about that.

186
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,480
But the plan was rejected because

187
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,520
it wasn't well-thought-out.

188
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,280
The plan is indeed

189
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,320
a little half-baked.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,640
But I

191
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,960
quite like the concept.

192
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,200
Why are you looking

193
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
at me with

194
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
such a surprising look?

195
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
You must be thinking that

196
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,680
why a businessman

197
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,960
would approve of an

198
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,000
unprofitable concept store?

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,520
Right?

200
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,080
If this is the question I have in mind,

201
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,480
could President Su give me an answer?

202
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,920
Let's sit down and have a chat.

203
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,480
Okay.

204
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,760
President Song.

205
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,800
President Song.

206
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
Welcome to the party.

207
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,720
Do you want a drink?

208
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
No, maybe next time.

209
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,920
It's already late at night.

210
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm coming to pick her up.

211
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Didn't you say you're not coming?

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm worried about you.

213
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,480
How was the party?

214
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,200
What did you get？

215
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,679
Su Yu Shan said that

216
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,720
he wants to invest in my concept store

217
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,440
plan.

218
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
What do you think?

219
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,640
I'll support you.

220
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
I'll support any decision you make.

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,960
But you seem a little

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,720
upset.

223
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
I'm a little worried.

224
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,600
About what?

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,040
You don't know Su Yu Shan well enough.

226
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,000
I worried that he'll deceive you.

227
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,680
Don't worry.

228
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll be careful.

229
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,240
Do you want to dance?

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,040
I don't know how to dance.

231
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,320
I'll teach you.

232
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,680
You're so beautiful.

233
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
You like me in this way?

234
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,960
It's alright.

235
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,600
Are you jealous?

236
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm not.

237
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,580
[DeltaHealth]

238
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,360
Look at you. You can't even peel

239
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
an apple properly.

240
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
Dad, you have to

241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,800
eat this apple.

242
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,800
I'll put it on an altar.

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,920
Uncle, are you feeling better now?

244
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,840
I've bought you some fruit.

245
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,920
You're too generous.

246
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,680
Shen,

247
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
you don't have to do this

248
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,640
from now on.

249
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
You've bought a lot of fruit.

250
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,320
We can't finish them.

251
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
I can take care of my dad.

252
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,240
You're busy with work.

253
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
Don't be distracted by us.

254
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,760
Alright then.

255
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
Uncle, I'll take my leave now.

256
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,360
Get some rest.

257
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,960
Okay.

258
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,920
Drive safe.

259
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
Sure. Don't you worry.

260
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,440
Qin Qing.

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
Go for a walk with me.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay.

263
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,360
Alright.

264
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,480
Take it slow.

265
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,520
I'm okay.

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm going to get you a jacket.

267
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,680
Okay.

268
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,120
Qin Qing.

269
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,840
I could tell how Shen feels

270
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,160
about you.

271
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,200
I could also tell how you

272
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,840
feel about him.

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,760
So,

274
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
what do you want to do with

275
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
your relationship

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
between you and Zuo?

277
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,680
Dad.

278
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,000
To be honest, I've always envied

279
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
you and mum's relationship

280
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,080
and your marriage.

281
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Your relationship is so stable
and you're so in love.

282
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
But when it comes to marriage,

283
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,800
I think

284
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,880
I should be more cautious.

285
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,960
Aren't you worried that

286
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,200
Zuo will run off if you keep hesitant?

287
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,000
I admit that

288
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:02,880
being with him

289
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,640
makes me very happy.

290
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
But how long

291
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,960
will this happiness last?

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
All this while,

293
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
he has been putting up

294
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,200
with me.

295
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,520
It's because

296
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
we're still in the honeymoon phase.

297
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,640
So he thinks

298
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,480
that everything is fine.

299
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
But once our

300
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
relationship cools down,

301
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
will more

302
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,120
conflicts arise?

303
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,320
I have no idea.

304
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,640
You did have too much thought.

305
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,880
But, Qin Qing,

306
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
life is merely

307
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,760
an endless

308
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,000
series of strategy games.

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,440
There's no way

310
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
you can predict the future.

311
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,640
Things will keep changing

312
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,360
throughout your life.

313
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,880
But

314
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
no matter whom you choose

315
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
to be your husband,

316
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,960
you need

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,040
courage to decide.

318
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,240
Okay.

319
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,760
I'll stop lecturing you.

320
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
In conclusion,

321
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,520
they are both good men.

322
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,760
I'm fine with either of them as my

323
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,840
son-in-law.

324
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
But I wish that you'll be happy

325
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
with your choice.

326
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,400
Hi.

327
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,080
Hi.

328
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
I have a meeting with Ms. Cheng.

329
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,360
You're President Song?

330
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,800
Yes.

331
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,720
President Cheng is waiting for you

332
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,160
in the office.

333
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll take you there.

334
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
It's okay. I'll head over on my own.

335
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,880
Alright.

336
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,720
Come in.

337
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,800
Ms. Cheng.

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,360
Here you come.

339
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,400
Please take a seat.

340
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,120
Here.

341
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,840
How's your break?

342
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,600
I've been

343
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,400
resting lately. I'm doing fine.

344
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,840
Are you in a good mood?

345
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,760
It's alright.

346
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
Do you have plans this weekend?

347
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I don't have any plan over the weekend.

348
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,160
What about you?

349
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,920
Come with me on a business trip

350
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,760
for some projects.

351
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,920
You're good at this.

352
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,040
I need your opinion.

353
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,760
Sure. I can do that.

354
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Let me help you with this.

355
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,880
Back then,

356
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
when you were still with my company,

357
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,760
I never had to worry about things like that.

358
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I let you start your own company,

359
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,120
thinking that

360
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,600
I could train some young employees

361
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,520
to take your place.

362
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,520
But it's unexpectedly

363
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,920
and

364
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
surprisingly hard to find

365
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,840
a fellow like you.

366
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,520
You're too kind.

367
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,320
If I really am

368
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,280
as good as you said,

369
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
I wouldn't

370
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,120
be empty-handed

371
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,240
and lost my company.

372
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
I have nothing left.

373
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's only temporary.

374
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
You know that very well.

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,440
Or else

376
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,920
you wouldn't be so

377
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
calm right now.

378
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,040
Besides,

379
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
once you sell your share

380
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,840
to someone else,

381
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,160
you'll gain a large

382
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,360
sum of money.

383
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,240
You wouldn't be empty-handed.

384
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,280
It's good to have some cash with you.

385
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,760
That's true.

386
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
But I can't

387
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,920
even sell

388
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,120
my share.

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
I can't find a buyer.

390
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,320
You don't have to worry about that.

391
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Don't you have

392
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
your own financial advisor?

393
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Moreover, companies all over the world are eager

394
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,080
to invest in

395
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
E-commerce businesses in China.

396
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,400
You just haven't

397
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,080
found the right buyer yet.

398
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,600
I hope so.

399
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,040
I hope everything works out fine.

400
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
So you've thought this through?

401
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,040
I still want to

402
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,080
start a concept store.

403
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
Of course, I would prefer to do that

404
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,080
with your help.

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
Does Song Lin know about this?

406
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,800
Yes, we have talked about this.

407
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,000
He's not against it.

408
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,400
He said that he would

409
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,440
respect all my decisions.

410
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

411
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,360
Let's get to the point then.

412
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,680
You kept asking me

413
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,400
why I would

414
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,280
invest in a concept store.

415
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
This is my reason:

416
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,200
it's true that we're in the Information Age.

417
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
And brick-and-mortar businesses

418
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,560
have indeed

419
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
met a huge blow,

420
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
but I believe that

421
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,160
physical stores

422
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,600
will not completely disappear,

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,880
especially in the

424
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,680
fashion industry.

425
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,080
For example, some well-known

426
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,400
overseas online brands

427
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,560
have their own

428
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,200
physical stores.

429
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,000
It's because each piece of clothing

430
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,440
has a different texture, cutting,
model, and workmanship.

431
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
Everyone has a different built.

432
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Therefore,

433
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,000
an online store

434
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,120
is not able to fully cater to the

435
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,080
customers' need.

436
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,400
That is why

437
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,880
I think

438
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,400
online stores will never completely

439
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
replace physical stores.

440
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,760
I agree with you on that.

441
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
It's true.

442
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,800
We all have

443
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
our strengths and limitations.

444
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,160
My company can

445
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,760
make up for what you don't have.

446
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,880
Although I'm grateful for you, President Su,

447
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,440
I still have a question

448
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
that keeps bugging me.

449
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,319
President Su, you have so many

450
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,400
notable designers working for you.

451
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,960
Why do you choose to help me?

452
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,560
First of all, I admire your talent.

453
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,480
That's for sure.

454
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,880
Second,

455
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,359
you remind me

456
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,119
of an old friend.

457
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,560
She was also

458
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
a very talented designer

459
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,240
with a unique taste and style.

460
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,880
How is she doing now?

461
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,120
She passed away.

462
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm sorry about that.

463
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,240
That's alright.

464
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,560
President Ling's work efficiency is

465
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,360
genuinely impressive

466
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,240
It's a big project.

467
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
You finished the evaluation for just a few days.

468
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,840
It's a good deal.

469
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,040
Of course, I have to seize the chance.

470
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,800
I'll arrange a meeting this weekend

471
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,480
between you

472
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,320
and our representative.

473
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
This weekend?

474
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,800
I might not make it this weekend.

475
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,520
I have an arrangement with President Cheng.

476
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,000
Is it President Cheng from Cheng Corporation?

477
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
I know about President Cheng's project.

478
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,040
She's going on

479
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,120
a field trip to Jiangcheng.

480
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
Our company also has a project

481
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,960
there.

482
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,000
I arrange it.

483
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,800
Okay. Thank you for that.

484
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,200
This deal

485
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
has not yet been closed.

486
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,560
As for how it will develop,

487
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,800
it's up to you.

488
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,520
Do I look good?

489
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
I'll leave Luo Luo to you

490
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,080
for the next two days.

491
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
No problem.

492
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,520
I forgot to tell you something.

493
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,680
What is it?

494
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
A couple of days ago, when I went to the

495
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,680
business district, I ran into Huo Chen Dong.

496
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,720
We had a chat.

497
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,880
Now he's helping me.

498
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,400
The two of you are in cahoots?

499
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,240
What's with that?

500
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,400
"In cahoots"?

501
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
He introduced to me

502
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,920
a number of clients from abroad.

503
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,680
When I come back from this business trip,

504
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,400
I'll talk to them.

505
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,760
You can do it.

506
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,440
You're just giving me a pep talk

507
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,760
and zero action.

508
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm talking to you.

509
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,320
That counts as an action.

510
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
That counts as half

511
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,000
an action.

512
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,000
Since Huo Chen Dong offered you help,

513
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,240
if I buy him a meal,

514
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,120
will you be jealous?

515
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,360
What do you think?

516
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,400
Will you be jealous? But I don't like him.

517
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,640
If you don't like him,

518
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,400
I won't be jealous.

519
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,720
Okay then.

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Alright. It's perfect.

521
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,280
Perfect?

522
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,320
What tie is it?

523
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,360
I have told you I don't
know how to tie a tie.

524
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,240
Aren't you a fashion designer?

525
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
Why do you not know how to tie?

526
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Who says a fashion designer

527
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,680
has to know how to tie a tie?

528
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,880
Let me teach you

529
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,960
how.

530
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
Do it this way. Wrap this end around that.

531
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,240
I'm leaving now.

532
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Stay safe at home,

533
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,400
you two.

534
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,920
Don't worry.

535
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,040
I'll take good care of Luo Luo.

536
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,120
I'm leaving now. Bye bye.

537
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,800
Have a safe trip.

538
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,400
I didn't expect that you'd help Song Lin out.

539
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,480
What happened between Wan Feng and Bai Sai

540
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,440
was a pretty huge deal.

541
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,360
The finance industry has been

542
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,160
following this matter.

543
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,560
Besides,

544
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,440
Song Lin is a decent man.

545
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,720
I admire his ability and talent as well.

546
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,120
We're all considered

547
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,840
well-acquainted, after all.

548
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Thank you.

549
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Don't mention it.

you two must be good.

552
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,520

554
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,040
As your best friend,

555
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I'm relieved.

556
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
You should worry about

557
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,960
yourself.

558
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,680
Myself? Never mind me.

559
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,360
I shall leave my dating life to fate.

560
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Zhou Fang,

561
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,000
I want to ask you something.

562
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
You must answer me

563
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,680
honestly.

564
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:31,960
Sure.

565
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,000
You promise?

566
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,280
I promise.

567
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,600
When we were in college,

568
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,600
had you ever,

569
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
even for a second,

570
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,600
liked me romantically?

571
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Forget about it.

572
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,720
It's all over now.

573
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,960
You don't have to answer. Sorry about that.

574
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes, I had.

575
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,400
I did like you.

576
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,760
But I thought that you

577
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,480
liked Qin Qing,

578
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,920
so I didn't dare to think of it.

579
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,600
Because of that,

580
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,920
slowly

581
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,640
and gradually,

582
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,360
I came to

583
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,160
see you as a friend.

584
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,760
In short, I used to like you.

585
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,520
But I'm telling you this,

586
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,680
it's not to make you feel regretful

587
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,400
or try to

588
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
make you my back-up plan.

589
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm telling you now

590
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,760
because

591
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,040
I think that relationships

592
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,800
depend on fate.

593
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
If we miss the chance, so be it.

594
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
If we didn't get together,

595
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
we're not meant to be.

596
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
I've met someone that

597
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,480
I truly want to cherish.

598
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
I hope that

599
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,320
you'll meet the right person for you

600
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,320
soon.

601
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,800
I understand.

602
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,480
It wasn't because of my lack of charm.

603
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,280
It's just fate.

604
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,920
Okay.

605
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
This is over.

606
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,680
We should move on

608

Actually, when I think about it...

you're so-so.

Who do you call "so-so"?

See, you resort to violence right away.

614
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,000
You're not lady-like at all.

615

Alright. Cheers, buddy.

You should go to the doctor.

It's nothing. It's just a fever.

I'll be fine after taking medicine.

621
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,840
If your fever doesn't go away, you must

622

go to the hospital right away.

00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,040
Zhou Fang.

699
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,840
Where's she?

700
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,880
Hello, Zhou Fang.

701
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,000
Where did you go early in the morning?

702
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
I was feeling unwell.

703
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,520
I'm at the hospital.

704
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,480
Hospital?

705
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,280
Didn't you seem fine

706
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,880
yesterday?

707
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
Why are you at the hospital?

708
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
It's nothing.

709
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,120
The doctor says that it's probably because

710
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,200
I've overworked myself lately.

711
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
My immune system is weakened.

712
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll be fine after a couple of days at the hospital.

713
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,560
Don't worry about me.

714
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,040
Which hospital are you at?

715
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm coming over to see you.

716
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,480
Please don't come over.

717
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,320
Qin Qing will arrive soon.

718
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,240
Also,

719
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,320
don't tell your

720
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,240
older brother about this.

721
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,360
I don't want him

722
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,280
to worry about me.

723
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,280
Okay. That's it.

724
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,920
I'm hanging up now.

725
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,840
How does she get sick all of sudden?

726
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,560
We've confirmed that

727
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
this patient has severe flu.

728
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,400
We're giving her

729
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,360
the treatment she needs.

730
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,000
We'll observe her situation.

731
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,520
Then she...

732
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,480
Since this patient has

733
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,000
no underlying health conditions.

734
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,680
With the proper treatment, she'll recover.

735
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,720
You don't have to be too concerned.

736
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,000
Go home and read some

737
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
relevant information.

738
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,800
There are a lot of

739
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,720
misinformation online.

740
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,560
But experts have already cleared it up

741
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,960
regarding this issue.

742
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,760
Don't worry.

743
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Thank you.

744
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,640
I'll get some paperwork done
for her stay at the hospital.

745
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,600
Thank you.

746
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,400
It's alright. Everything is fine.

747
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,040
Don't worry and focus on your business trip.

748
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,440
Stop using the phone.

749
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,920
You're very ill.

750
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,840
Take a nap.

751
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,320
I'm okay.

752
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,320
Why didn't

753
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,760
you tell me sooner?

754
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,800
I thought it was nothing.

755
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,280
You should go now.

756
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm pretty much fine.

757
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,280
It's still visiting time.

758
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,760
Just let me stay

759
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,600
with you for a while.

760
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,840
Nurse,

761
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I know the condition

762
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
of my health.

763
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,560
Why don't

764
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,880
you give me some antibiotics.

765
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,880
I'll take them and stay home.

766
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,800
Look at your test result.

767
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,120
Does it look like a common cold to you?

768
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,760
Nurse, I really don't want to be hospitalized.

769
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,520
It's not

770
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,600
up to you to decide.

771
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,640
You're a patient.

772
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
You must listen to the doctor.

773
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,080
It's very important to follow

774
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,000
the doctor's advice and receive

775
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,840
proper treatment.

776
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,280
There has been another patient.

777
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Nurse, I...

778
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,760
Stop arguing with me.

779
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,800
This is your bed.

780
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,640
Wu San?

781
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,280
Qin Qing.

782
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,920
Miss Fang.

783
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,480
Miss Fang, you're sick too?

784
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,680
Yeah.

785
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,640
What... what's going on with you?

786
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Why are you here?

787
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,520
I have a fever for a few days.

788
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,760
Fever?

789
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,080
What did the doctor say?

790
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,040
I'm okay.

791
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,040
The doctor overreacted.

792
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Are you more professional than the doctor?

793
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,920
Alright.

794
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
I'm going to your house

795
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,760
to pick up some clothes for you.

796
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,080
Stay here.

797
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,600
Okay.

798
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Can you go over to my house

799
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,400
to pick up something too?

800
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
Don't you have any friends?

801
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,400
Give me your house key.

802
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Send me your address.

803
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,360
You should lie down and rest.

804
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,920
You too, Miss Fang.

805
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,320
Lin Lin.

806
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,280
Lin Lin.

807
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,040
Lin Lin.

808
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,720
Hey, Lin Lin.

809
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,640
Are you not at home?

810
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
Mum, I'm not at home.

811
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,400
I forgot to tell you that
I'm on a business trip.

812
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,440
You didn't tell me.

813
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,080
I come to cook for you.

814
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,000
How long will you be away?

815
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,960
About

816
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,160
a week, probably.

817
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,360
For so long?

818
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,240
Take good care of

819
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,960
yourself then.

820
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,760
I'm not a child anymore.

821
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,160
I can look after myself.

822
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm busy. I'm hanging up now.

823
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,880
Okay.

824
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,840
I'll go home then.

825
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,640
Was that your mother?

826
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,880
She worried that I would skip meals, so

827
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
she bought some groceries over.

828
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,320
Oh, no.

829
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,680
Will she run into

830
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,840
Qin Qing?

831
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,320
Quick, give her a call now.

832
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
It may be too late.

833
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,240
They probably won't happen, right?

834
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,640
Why are you laughing?

835
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,600
I just realize that

836
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
people are truly strange

837
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,360
sometimes.

838
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,040
When something is up, the first person

839
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,120
you think of will be

840
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,720
the person you care about the most.

841
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,600
But at the same time, you also try to

842
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,320
hide bad news from the people you

843
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,160
care about.

844
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,280
Aren't you doing the same?

845
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,280
You're hiding this from Lin.

846
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,240
He would blame me if he learns about the truth.

847
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I'm in a different situation.

848
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,920
I'll recover by the time he comes back.

849
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,840
After we've got

850
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,760
together,

851
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,080
every time something happens,

852
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,960
he always thinks that it was because

853
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,800
of him and that

854
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,680
he is a burden to me.

855
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,680
But the problem he faces is

856
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,600
far more difficult

857
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,320
and complicated than mine.

858
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,640
Still, the first thing on his mind is

859
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,200
always to try to find a way to protect me.

860
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,160
I, on the other hand,

861
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,080
can't do anything for him.

862
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,800
Seriously?

863
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:24,880
No.

864
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
Let's just watch the movie.

865
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,480
Don't think you can win the fight.

866
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm telling you. Don't even think about it.

867
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,560
Watch the movie.

868
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,720
Watch the movie.

869
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,820
♪ The wind stopped, the insects quieted down
But my breath is getting faster ♪

What is it?

874
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:00,920
Sit down.

875
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,280
I'll sit down later.

876
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,440
Sit down now.

877
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,800
I'm going to give you a massage.

878
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280

Over here. Here.

881
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,560
You've been doing

882
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,520
laundry and cooking this entire morning.

883
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,800
You even cleaned the rooms.

884
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,680
You're going to spoil me.

885
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,680
I'll spoil you then.

886
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,080
Isn't that great?

887
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm going to massage you some more.

893
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,800
He had been staying by my side

894
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,600
lately.

895
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,520
He was relaxed and enjoying life.

896
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,520
I didn't see any look of concern

897
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,880
and sadness on his face,

898
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,880
as if nothing had

899
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,760
happened at all.

900
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,600
But the calmer he appears,

901
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,320
the more concerned I am.

902
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,280
I worry that he's trying hard
to hide his emotions.

903
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,960
I want to

904
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
give him some space.

905
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,080
When he has time for himself, he'd get

906
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,160
a clearer picture of his situation.

907
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,200
He did not just leave

908
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,960
Wan Feng temporarily.

909
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,600
He has lost it forever.

910
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,640
Although it isn't

911
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,640
his job to

912
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,600
accompany Ms Cheng

913
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,680
on a field trip,

914
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,560
I hope that he'd get to

915
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
travel around and

916
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,880
make new friends

917
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,880
instead of staying at home all day.

918
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,720
Besides,

919
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,400
I hope that he'll

920
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,960
successfully sell his share.

921
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,640
I can't let this fall apart

922
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,520
because I get sick

923
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,160
and make him come back to keep me company.

924
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,360
Why is Wu San

925
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,320
sick as well?

926
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
It's flu.

927
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,840
One can be infected just by speaking

928
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
to an infected person.

929
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,560
Why would they

930
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,720
need to be hospitalized then?

931
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,240
They stay there so that doctors
can closely monitor their conditions and make

932
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,440
adjustments to their
treatment plans accordingly.

933
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,280
So that they will

934
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,080
recover sooner.

935
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,840
But I still want to visit her.

936
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,800
Don't go.

937
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,240
She's alright.

938
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,000
She'll be back after a few days.

939
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,440
Now you ought to

940
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,360
take good care of

941
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,400
yourself.

942
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,040
Here. Have some more of this

943
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,720
