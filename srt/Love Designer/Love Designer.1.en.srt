Hey!

184
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,080
Hey!

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,800
Hey! Wake up!

186
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,960
Hey...You...

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,760
Are you alright?

188
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,160
Do you want to die?

189
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,800
What?

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Do you want to die?

191
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,920
You're the one who wanted to die!

192
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,000
You drove too fast around the curve!

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,560
Do you even have

194
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,480
any common sense?

195
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,600
You're crazy!

196
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,360
Wearing this

197
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
and walking in the middle of the road.

198
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
Desperate woman!

199
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
Are you out hunting for men?

200
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,920
In your dreams!

201
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,000
You think I'd hunt you?

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,440
Hunt me?

203
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,560
You stand no chance!

204
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,160
Hey,

205
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,000
where are your manners?

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,520
You're making a fuss even when
you're the one who hit me.

207
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,520
Don't you know how to apologize?

208
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,080
Hey, are you in your right mind?

209
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,240
This is a driving lane,

210
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,640
okay?

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,520
For vehicles!

212
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,640
What type of vehicle are you?

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,680
Are you a vehicle?

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,600
Do you drink petrol?

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Fine. Whatever.

216
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
It's my bad luck for running into you.

217
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
Just leave now.

218
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,160
Crazy woman.

219
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
Wearing that and walking in the middle of the road.

220
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Pity my motorbike.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,600
What?

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,480
Lend me your cellphone.

223
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
What do you want to do?

224
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,840
Call for help. Lend me your phone.

225
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,440
I didn't bring it.

226
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
What now?

227
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,960
Help me with this.

228
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,440
You're a man

229
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,480
and you can't pick up your bike?

230
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
I almost broke my arm,

231
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,760
okay?

232
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,480
Use some strength.

233
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,800
I am using my strength.

234
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,000
Thanks!

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Why are you following me?

236
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Why would I follow you?

237
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,880
There's only one road.

238
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,400
Where else can I go?

239
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
You're hungry?

240
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,120
Push my motorbike,

241
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,800
and I'll treat you to a meal.

242
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,680
Come on!

243
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I can't push it anymore.

244
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,680
Thank you.

245
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,520
I'll pay you back

246
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,200
when I meet my friend tomorrow.

247
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,040
It's alright.

248
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,760
After today,

249
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,640
we'll go back to being strangers.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
Here are your drinks.

251
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,080
Thank you!

252
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,800
Thank you.

253
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,320
Please enjoy.

254
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
For five years...

255
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Five long years...

256
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,360
Five years...

257
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,200
I gave him all of my youth

258
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
and my career.

259
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,960
How many five years

260
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
can a woman have?

261
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,640
I gave him everything.

262
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,360
My friends' birthdays,

263
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,280
my parents' birthdays,

264
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,240
even during all festivals,

265
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,200
he would remember

266
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,560
to send them a message.

267
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,280
He would remember

268
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,240
to give them presents.

269
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,400
I seriously thought

270
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,120
I met

271
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,040
the man of my life,

272
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
the man who'd love me the most.

273
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,640
He would consider my feelings

274
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,120
and take care of everything.

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,760
I thought that

276
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,160
he was too nice to me.

277
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,120
How can someone

278
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
treat me so nicely?

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,880
He remembered everything about me.

280
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,200
Even if I messed up,

281
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
he would forgive me.

282
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,200
I thought that

283
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
this man was really the one

284
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,200
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

285
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
That's why

286
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
I made my own wedding dress.

287
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,040
It was only when I walked towards him

288
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,920
that I found out that

289
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,040
this man was cheating on me
with another woman

290
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
behind my back

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600
and

292
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
for several years.

293
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,720
I only found out today.

294
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I really only found it out today.

295
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,320
You must be

296
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
feeling sorry for me.

297
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,560
In fact, I feel alright.

298
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,280
Thank goodness I found out now...

299
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,599
the kind of person he is.

300
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,520
If I discovered this after the wedding,

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,079
then there would

302
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,920
really be

303
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,079
no way out for me.

304
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,680
You don't have to pity me,

305
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,720
even if I'm already pitiful

306
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,760
to begin with...

307
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,800
Better to know about it sooner rather than later.

308
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,200
Don't drink too much.

309
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,480
I wish you happiness in the future.

310
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,640
I'll head off.

311
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,080
Yup.

312
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,840
Fine. Leave.

313
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,920
Aren't all men like this?

314
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
Just leave...

315
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,160
Go away, as far as you can...

316
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,040
Hello.

317
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,560
Hello.

318
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,920
I'd like to have two rooms.

319
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,720
Sorry,

320
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,440
but we have

321
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
one last room available.

322
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
Other rooms are fine.

323
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,080
Suites are fine too.

324
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,120
We only have one last

325
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,880
double room.

326
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
Double room...

327
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,000
Are there

328
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,720
any other hotels around here?

329
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,040
Sorry,

330
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,520
we are

331
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,560
the only hotel in the town.

332
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,560
I feel sick.

333
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,560
Yup.

334
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,680
My motorbike is broken.

335
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm okay.

336
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,040
I'm alright,

337
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,880
but the motorbike...

338
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,440
was spoilt...

339
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,960
I have another favor

340
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,040
to ask from you.

341
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,680
My luggage is with you, right?

342
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,680
Please help me

343
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,920
to send my luggage over tomorrow?

344
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,840
And

345
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,840
buy two cellphones for me.

346
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Then,

347
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
prepare a car for me as well.

348
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,760
Alright.

349
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,480
Any car is fine.

350
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,080
Okay.

351
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
That's all. Thanks.

352
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,160
Hello,

353
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,000
this is 110,

354
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,800
police hotline.

355
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,080
How can I help you?

356
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,040
My fiancée went missing.

357
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
She neither brought her cellphone

358
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,840
nor her wallet.

359
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,600
Can you

360
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,440
search for her?

361
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,480
Can I know

362
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
when did she go missing?

363
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,840
Since last night.

364
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,400
Just a moment. Very soon.

365
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,720
You modified it?

366
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
The wedding dress was getting inconvenient,

367
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,560
so I cut it.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,120
Get out. I need to change.

369
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,160
You drive.

370
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,080
Why am I driving?

371
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,360
I hurt my arm.

372
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,600
For me?

373
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
Something happened yesterday,

374
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,800
so I'm coming back today.

375
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,760
Have you eaten?

376
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
Do you want anything?

377
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,840
Let me know

378
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
and I'll buy it for you.

379
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,160
What are you waiting for? Drive.

380
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,360
Have you seen this person before?

381
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,080
Yes, I have.

382
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
She just left.

383
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,840
Didn't I tell you not to speed?

384
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
I didn't speed.

385
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,560
Pull over.

386
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,800
Stop the car.

387
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,880
May I see your ID, please?

388
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,400
ID.

389
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,480
ID.

390
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,360
I didn't bring it.

391
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
Do you know each other?

392
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,440
-Yes.
-No.

393
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,280
Qin Qing, you're not here yet?

394
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,360
They wouldn't let me leave.

395
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,880
They said they need to confirm my identity.

396
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,000
Okay, let's talk when you're here.

397
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,240
I'll hang up now.

398
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,360
I'll pick up my call too.

399
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Who said you're allowed to make phone calls?

400
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,640
Put down your cellphone.

401
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,053
Why was she allowed then?

402
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:01,920
My dear,

403
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,720
where have you been?

404
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
Do you know

405
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,520
how worried I was?

406
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,400
You're the one who called the police?

407
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,120
Yes.

408
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,840
I am her fiance.

409
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Sir,

410
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,040
sorry,

411
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,800
I don't know him.

412
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:21,495
[Taoyuan Bay Police Station]

413
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay.

414
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,920
You can leave now.

415
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,080
Thank you so much.

416
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,520
Sorry for the trouble.

417
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,560
No problem, it's our job.

418
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:28,960
Fang.

419
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,560
Thank you.

420
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,080
Dear.

421
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,520
You're welcome.

422
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,440
Dear.

423
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,360
Dear.

424
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,120
Let go of me.

425
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
Let me explain.

426
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
Let you explain what?

427
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,440
Let go!

428
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,560
She said, let go!

429
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,320
Who are you?

430
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
She is my fiancée.

431
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
Is this any of your business?

432
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,760
No.

433
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,400
Can't I just be a busybody?

434
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,640
Zhou Fang...

435
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,560
Let go of her!

436
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,600
Qin Qing.

437
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,400
Wang Ze Yang!

438
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,000
How dare you cheat on her?!

439
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,440
Qin Qing. Qin Qing.

440
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Qin Qing, let me explain.

441
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,600
Go to hell! Go to hell!

442
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,760
Hold still! Don't you move!

443
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,440
It's the entrance of the police station.

444
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,440
Can't they fight elsewhere?

445
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,200
Go to hell!

446
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,200
Go! Go down!

447
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,720
Qin Qing.

448
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,560
What are you doing?

449
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,480
Qin Qing, Qin Qing!

450
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,800
Are you crazy?

451
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
Who are you calling crazy?

452
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,080
Qin Qing.

453
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
Zhou Fang, let me explain.

454
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,360
It's not

455
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,440
what you're thinking.

456
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Go back with me,

457
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,280
okay?

458
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,040
Go back with you?

459
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,880
Who's going back with you?

460
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,960
How about I go back with you?

461
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,880
What do you think?

462
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,440
I'll go back with you,

463
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,840
okay?

464
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,720
I'll go back with you.

465
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,440
Qin Qing, Qin Qing!

466
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,160
Is that okay?!

467
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,960
Don't let me see you again!

468
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
You're Song Lin?

469
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,040
I'm not.

470
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,520
You're not?

471
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,200
You know each other?

472
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,800
No.

473
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,440
I'll head off.

474
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,200
Wait a minute.

475
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,000
Let me return your coat.

476
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,200
Pass me your phone, Qin Qing.

477
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,400
Just a minute.

478
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,120
Why is it off?

479
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,880
It ran out of battery.

480
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,960
I was thinking of

481
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,800
paying you back,

482
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,880
but the phone died.

483
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,760
How about this?

484
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,800
You give me your phone number,

485
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,600
and I'll pay you back

486
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,840
as soon as I get back home.

487
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Sorry for all the trouble.

488
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,520
Let's have a meal together next time.

489
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,520
It's alright.

490
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,480
I'll head off.

491
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,760
Bye, Miss Fang!

492
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,080
Bye bye.

493
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,200
Be careful

494
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,040
when you're driving.

495
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,560
Send me a message when you get back.

496
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,080
Chuu~ Mi~

497
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,080
Roger that.

498
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Bye!

499
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,040
Bye.

500
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,400
It's enough, cut the act.

501
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,440
He can't see you now.

502
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,080
Let's go, change our clothes.

503
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,120
Second round.

504
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,760
I just broke up.

505
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,200
So what if you broke up?

506
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,640
Let me show you

507
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
what the outside world looks like.

508
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,120
I'm too tired.

509
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,080
I want to sleep.

510
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,560
How is it?

511
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,120
Excited?

512
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,720
What did you say?

513
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,440
I said, do you feel excited?

514
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,760
Not too bad!

515
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,680
Are you in for something

516
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,760
more exciting?

517
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,880
Of course, I am!

518
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,920
Let's go!

519
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,640
Then, I jumped down...

520
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,520
Friends, we are here!

521
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,760
We are here!

522
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes, we are!

523
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,840
You're too funny.

524
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,280
Do they know you?

525
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,360
Why isn't anyone talking to you?

526
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,880
No, they don't.

527
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,560
We're crashing their party?

528
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,800
This is what you call exciting.

529
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,960
Watch and learn.

530
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,480
Elvis, nice hair!

531
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,120
I like it.

532
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,400
Thank you.

533
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,120
Who's friend are you?

534
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,520
I'm Nan's friend.

535
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,400
Nan?

536
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,160
You are...

537
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,160
I've been friends with him for a long time.

538
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,200
Then, we're friends too.

539
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,000
Come, cheers!

540
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,760
Here we go.

541
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
Here we go.

542
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Hello, hello.

543
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
I know this song.

544
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,720
I know this song.

545
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,040
This is a duet.

546
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,080
Erm...

547
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,920
Be careful.

548
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,560
Give me that.

549
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,280
It's starting.

550
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,640
Give it to me. Faster!

551
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,840
Whose friends are they?

552
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,920
Nan's friends.

553
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,680
Nan's friends?

554
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,920
Why didn't you introduce us

555
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,520
to such a pretty woman?

556
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,280
She's not my friend.

557
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't know her.

558
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,360
No more heartbreaks...

559
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,800
Did you walk into

560
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,560
the wrong room?

561
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,400
The wrong room?

562
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,080
No...

563
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,680
What's the room number?

564
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,760
But none of us here

565
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,720
knows you two.

566
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't tell me

567
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,480
you're here to crash our party?

568
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,880
Do we even look like such people?

569
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,160
Then, tell us

570
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,200
who do you know here?

571
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,960
Nan.

572
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,560
Call Nan out.

573
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:41,920
Yup.

574
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,840
I am Nan.

575
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,440
Nan!

576
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,960
Who on earth do you know?

577
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,560
I know her.

578
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,680
She's my friend.

579
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,440
I see.

580
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,920
Fine then.

581
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,480
Let's continue.

582
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,080
Let's continue.

583
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
Why did you sit there?

584
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,400
I only saw you now.

585
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,040
Seriously...

586
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,640
Why are you so mean?

587
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,760
Why didn't you call me just now?

588
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,920
Zuo Yu Lin,

589
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,840
you know

590
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,440
such pretty ladies.

591
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,080
Why didn't you

592
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
introduce them to us?

593
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,680
Zuo Yu Lin...

594
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,440
I need to throw up.

595
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,200
I'll go with you.

596
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,080
You don't have to.

597
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,520
I can't hold it.

598
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,600
Be careful.

599
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,720
Be careful.

600
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,240
Zuo...

601
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,120
Yu Lin.

602
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,960
My name is Qin Qing.

603
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
Nice to meet you.

604
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,280
Nice to meet you.

605
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,200
A toast to you.

606
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,840
Here.

607
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
I can't drink too much alcohol.

608
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,800
Can't drink too much alcohol?

609
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,160
Are you a pupil?

610
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm a university graduate.

611
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm out tonight

612
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,040
for a dinner with my mates.

613
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,760
I can tell that

614
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,920
you're tied up by your personality.

615
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,000
You still remember what you studied from

616
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,320
5 SAT's and 3 Mock's,

617
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,880
don't you?

618
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,239
Come,

619
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,239
I'll give you a nickname.

620
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,280
Let's call you

621
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,400
Wu San*.
(*Lit: five, three)

622
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,840
Sounds good?

623
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,920
Come, Wu San.

624
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,320
Here's to you.

625
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,880
Don't drink this!

626
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,080
Have a beer. Here.

627
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,600
I've found you

628
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,480
a boyfriend.

629
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,920
I don't want one.

630
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,080
I don't want one.

631
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,480
That...Song Lin...

632
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,760
Song Lin seemed good.

633
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
What? Who's that?

634
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
Song Lin!

635
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,239
The one on the island that day...

636
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,239
The man you met on the island.

637
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,680
Do you remember? He's called Song Lin.

638
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,960
Not only that,

639
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,080
he is the president of Wan Feng Group.

640
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,280
And he has a hot body.

641
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,880
He is a popular man.

642
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,160
Apparently, he has

643
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,320
a rumored girlfriend

644
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,600
called Lu Na

645
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,080
who is a celebrity.

646
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,320
Welcome to

647
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
the press conference for Chuang Pin Net

648
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,280
held by Wan Feng Group.

649
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,600
Let us welcome

650
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,680
the president of Wan Feng Group

651
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,280
and the famous actress,

652
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,360
Miss Luna to come up the stage.

653
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Today, Song Lin,

654
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,720
the president of Wan Feng Group

655
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,840
and Lu Na are here

656
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,120
at the ballroom of Zhou Ji Hotel.

657
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,600
Lu Na is officially

658
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,560
the new ambassador

659
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,680
for Chuang Pin Net.

660
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,960
The two were seen locking their arms

661
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,680
and acting intimate.

662
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,600
Thus, it's speculated

663
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,800
that they were more than a working relationship.

664
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,880
Reported to you by
Entertainment Frontline.

665
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,640
Let's call it a night.

666
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,280
I can't drink anymore.

667
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,360
I still want to go.

668
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,480
Are you two alright?

669
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,880
You were in there for a long time.

670
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
We're okay.

671
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,120
I think...You're the one who's not okay.

672
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,560
I'm okay.

673
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,560
I mean

674
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,240
here.

675
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,800
I surrender.

676
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,680
You guys continue your business.

677
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,120
What do you mean?

678
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,400
I am not

679
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,240
that oblivious.

680
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,720
I'll get going.

681
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,920
I'm tired. Bye.

682
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,640
Where are you going?

683
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,480
Did you drive here?

684
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,360
Yes, I did.

685
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,920
Can you send us home?

686
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,120
Okay. I'll arrange for a designated driver.

687
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,160
I'll see you at the entrance.

688
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,800
Sure.

689
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,760
Thank you.

690
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,800
Love you.

691
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,600
Wu San.

692
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,560
it's unexpected that your tricks were so cliche,

693
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,760
although you're so young.

694
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,880
You even dared to say

695
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,600
you know me?

696
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,720
I wasn't lying.

697
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
I do know you.

698
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Of course.

699
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,520
A person doesn't just meet

700
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,840
another person coincidentally.

701
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,120
In our past life,

702
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,800
we must have known each other.

703
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,440
Maybe in your past lives,

704
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,480
you two weren't able to be together.

705
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,040
So you are destined to meet in this life

706
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,480
to continue your love story.

707
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,360
What do you think?

708
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,000
Mr Driver, please

709
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,600
go up the expressway, then go down,

710
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,040
and turn left at the next junction.

711
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,920
What are you doing?

712
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,240
It's already late. Why are you

713
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,120
still going to the company?

714
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,200
Are you scared that if you go home,

715
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,560
you might meet Wang Ze Yang?

716
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,440
It's not that.

717
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,320
You stay at my place tonight.

718
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,920
I'll be by your side.

719
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I really need to go back to the company.

720
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,760
There is a very,

721
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,960
very,

722
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,720
very important document that I need to sign.

723
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,080
Since, it's so important...

724
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,440
Fine, you go.

725
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,920
Mr Driver, please so faster.

726
00:38:52,077 --> 00:38:53,013
[Ze Yang]

727
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,600
Wang Ze Yang.

728
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,840
Do you want to

729
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,880
grab a drink at my place later?

730
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Just joking. Did you take it seriously?

731
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,680
It's been a long day for you.

732
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't mention it.

733
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,320
A win-win situation

734
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,188
is always the best.

735
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,200
I'll get going.

736
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,960
This is my place.

737
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,640
I'll...go in now.

738
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,640
Get some rest.

739
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,320
Thank you.

740
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,520
Go back.

741
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,400
Coco!

742
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,840
Wu San!

743
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,360
Help me catch Coco!

744
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,240
Okay!

745
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,480
I think it went that way!

746
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,360
Coco,

747
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,240
why did you run off?

748
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,920
Are you alright?

749
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,200
Did you catch a cold?

750
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,600
No, no.

751
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,320
Coco, go drink some water.

752
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,720
You must be thirsty too.

753
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,960
I'll get you some water.

754
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Have a seat. Make yourself at home.

755
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,680
Here. Drink some water.

756
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,080
Thanks.

757
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,840
The liquors are kicking in.

758
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,840
Qin Qing.

759
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,560
You've been to so many countries?

760
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,440
Whenever I have time,

761
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,920
I would travel everywhere,

762
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,840
and wander everywhere.

763
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,560
What are these?

764
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,560
These are accessories I've found

765
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,520
from every corner of the world.

766
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,120
I need them for my work.

767
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Work?

768
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,600
Jewelry designer.

769
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,040
Do you earn a lot

770
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,080
working as a jewelry designer?

771
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:19,920
Nope.

772
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
But you're living in

773
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,000
such a big house by yourself.

774
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,120
These were all given by my parents.

775
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,400
The designated driver is here.

776
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,280
Then you should get going.

777
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,480
I'll make a move.

778
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,600
Safe trip back.

779
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,720
Rest well.

780
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,840
Qin Qing,

781
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,400
can you give me your phone number?

782
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,280
Pass me your cellphone.

783
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,320
I'll head off.

784
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,000
