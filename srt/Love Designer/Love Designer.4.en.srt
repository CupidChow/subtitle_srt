Luo Luo. Come and eat.

Song Luo.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,200
If you can

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
be friendly to your classmates

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,920
and stop making trouble,

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
this issue can be left behind.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Come out and eat.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
Mind your own business.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
You'd have been expelled of school
if I abandoned you.

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,560
Do you think I'm willing to go to school?

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
What do you do if not go to school?

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,920

Luo Luo. You either wear headphones

or turn it down!

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,920
I kindly remind you.

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Don't be too strict

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
when dealing with your sister.

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
Or else, she'll rebel against you.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
She behaves like this even now.

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
It'll be more terrible
if I don't be strict with her.

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,560
Is it effective

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,600
to be strict with her?

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
You should find problems

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,120
of your own.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,160

President Song.

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
I don't mean to break my words.

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,760
I don't want to disturb you either.

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,560
But last time,

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
you told me that

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,440
you're looking for

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,960
the source of leaked design drafts?

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
You found your ex-boyfriend?

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,800
My friend has caught him.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,560
But he's stubborn.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
I couldn't get anything from him.

64
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,400
Do you have any idea?

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
Send me the address.

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,320
Cheng Rong Trading Co., Ye Zi Fashion.

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
Are they your collaborators?

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,840
How is it?

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
What's your plan?

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
President Song.

71
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,680
First of all,

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
I'd like to apologize to you.

73
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,360
I really didn't know that

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
they were your designs.

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,600
If I knew it,

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,760
I wouldn't do it for sure.

77
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,560
Moreover,

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,400
we're victims too.

79
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,920
Right?

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,120
You're the boss of a big corporate.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,880
You don't have to

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
make trouble for us.

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,200
Right?

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,840
Are you a victim too?

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,040
My corporate is big,

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
so our designs should be counterfeited?

87
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
A corporate shouldn't ask for justice?

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
Can I haggle with you?

89
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Sure, you can.

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,480
Actually,

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,960
I don't mean it.

92
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,440
Where did you get the design drafts?

93
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
Hurry up. I'm busy.

94
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,440
President Song.

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,520
I'd like to talk to Zhou Fang.

96
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,840
What a coincidence.

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,920
What coincidence?

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
The person you're talking about

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
is our President Song.

100
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
Wang Ze Yang

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,360
is too unlucky.

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,400
He got in trouble.

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
Your President Song?

104
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
Didn't I tell you that

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
I've joined a company before?

106
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
Wan Feng Group.

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,520
Song Lin is our boss.

108
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,320
Is he your boss?

109
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,920
You should have said it earlier.

110
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,080
I was having a court case

111
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,240
with your company before.

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,280
If I knew it,

113
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,000
I would have…

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,280
He'd like to talk to you.

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,560
What?

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,920
Fang.

117
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,760
Please give me another chance.

118
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,320
What a trick to get my confidence.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,280
What trick?

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm not playing any trick.

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
Since we broke up,

122
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,560
I regret

123
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,160
my doings.

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,080
I think that

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm not a good guy!

126
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,560
Fang.

127
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
Sorry.

128
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,560
What do you mean?

129
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,200
Do you think that Song Lin

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,360
will forgive you because of that?

131
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,480
Let me tell you.

132
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,200
I have no say in this.

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
It's useless to fawn over me.

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,560
It's nothing to do with President Song.

135
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,920
I really miss you.

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
We've been together for years.

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,520
You should know that

138
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,240
I have you in my mind.

139
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,400
You shouldn't

140
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
blame me

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,720
for the mistake I did this time.

142
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,800
Moreover,

143
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
Shen Pei Pei was the one who seduced me.

144
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,080
I…

145
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,200
Are you

146
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
the one

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,120
who was injured together with Chen Chen?

148
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
Yes. Yes. You still remember me.

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,960
Why are you here?

150
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,800
It's a long story.

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,640
It's a coincidence.

152
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Have you recovered?

153
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Yes.

154
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,240
Alright.

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
Get back to work now.

156
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Okay, President Song.

157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Fang.

158
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,720
I know that you want to

159
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
have your own brand.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Do you think that I chose

161
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,080
to involve myself in counterfeit?

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,520
For whom I did all these?

163
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,640
I just wanted to get

164
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,720
more capital

165
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,440
and resources,

166
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,960
so that I could

167
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,790
support you.

168
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,640
Do you mean that

169
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,790
you've become this

170
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,600
because of me?

171
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Think it over.

172
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,400
You must accept the reality

173
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,120
before talking about your dream.

174
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,560
Because of you,

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
I've lost the money

176
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,240
and sold the house.

177
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,160
Are you happy?

178
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,680
It's not what I wanted.

179
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,800
If I knew it,

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,160
I wouldn't

181
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,000
take the risk.

182
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Alright. I'm unlucky. Okay?

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Yes.

184
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,560
You're not smart enough

185
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,320
to know that

186
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,200
you'd get this today.

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm…

188
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm really

189
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
well-intentioned.

190
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,960
Okay, I got it.

191
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,960
But you should know that

192
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,680
the resources and network of Song Lin.

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,080
are totally

194
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,000
different from yours.

195
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,720
If you want to stay in this field,

196
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
you should tell him

197
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,720
all the channels

198
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
and the ways you got

199
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
the designs of Si Yue.

200
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,080
You have to

201
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
tell him honestly.

202
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,200
If you help him

203
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,120
by telling everything,

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,720
the case can be closed.

205
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,600
Think twice.

206
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
It's nothing to do with me.

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,400
It's because of the social network.

208
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,160
Any other brands

209
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,120
besides Si Yue?

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,040
Two or three more, I think.

211
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,720
So why did you pick Si Yue?

212
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
All these belong to Wan Feng Group.

213
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
It doesn't matter.

214
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,560
Moreover,

215
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
the price of Si Yue

216
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
is relatively cheaper.

217
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,680
Let me know

218
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
their contacts.

219
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,920
Actually,

220
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
we seldom contact each other.

221
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,960
Moreover,

222
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a critical period

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
now.

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,840
I got it.

225
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,320
You said that

226
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,360
you wanted to apologize to me,

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,040
but

228
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
you're not doing it sincerely.

229
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
You're being vigilant.

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,880
Why did you ask me to come over?

231
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,880
No. No. No.

232
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,480
Fang. Fang. Fang.

233
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,200
Please don't leave.

234
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm not being vigilant at all.

235
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,560
It isn't

236
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
like what you think.

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,040
Moreover,

238
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,200
it's really complicated.

239
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
If I revealed it,

240
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,960
I'd get into trouble

241
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
for sure.

242
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,000
Fang.

243
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,120
The big figures are fighting.

244
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,000
Since we are nobodies,

245
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,680
we should get ourselves out of it.

246
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,800
Since we're

247
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,720
in love for years,

248
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
please help me.

249
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm okay to help you.

250
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,680
You just need to tell me

251
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
everything,

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
only then I can help you.

253
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,040
It isn't

254
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,960
like what you think.

255
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,360
Moreover,

256
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
it's really complicated.

257
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
If I revealed it,

258
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
I'd get into trouble

259
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,560
for sure.

260
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,400
What are you going to do?

261
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,240
He's explained it.

262
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,240
It's nothing to do with you.

263
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,480
What are you going to do?

264
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,800
It's fine for you to do anything.

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's willing to cooperate,

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
as long as he is given a guarantee.

267
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
No problem.

268
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,400
What's your plan in future?

269
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,080
I dared not to do anything

270
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,200
when I had everything.

271
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,840
Now, I have nothing left.

272
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,280
I'd have a chance

273
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,320
to do something I dared not to,

274
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
such as original design.

275
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Not bad.

276
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
Let me know if you need help.

277
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,440
Send me the recording.

278
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,040
Okay.

279
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,320
What were you talking about?

280
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,400
It took so long time.

281
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,080
We talked about recording,

282
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,200
Wang Ze Yang and future.

283
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Do you think

284
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,720
if he'll take

285
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,320
this opportunity

286
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,320
to get close to you?

287
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
What are you thinking?

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,520
He can't wait to avoid me.

289
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,920
Okay.

290
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,800
Wait for it.

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
Let's go and eat.

292
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,280
Steamboat.

293
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,280
Let's go.

294
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,880
Hand in your work.

295
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
Please hand in

296
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,800
yesterday's homework.

297
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,040
What?

298
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,080
There are explanations

299
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,000
and mind maps for answers.

300
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,000
Tell me

301
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
if you don't understand it.

302
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,680
The 20 fashion companies

303
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,080
that had been investigated

304
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,480
have stopped their copyright infringement.

305
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,120
However,

306
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
there are many small factories

307
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,240
couldn't be found.

308
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,640
They couldn't be verified.

309
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,520
The counterfeits found

310
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,640
in the market now

311
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,400
should belong to them.

312
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,120
I think that we should

313
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,320
investigate

314
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,960
how the design drafts

315
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
leaked.

316
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,440
I got it.

317
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,200
What about brand acquisition?

318
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,800
How is it going?

319
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,440
Yesterday,

320
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
I've called President Sun.

321
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
Due to the

322
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,840
good overseas warehouse,

323
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,160
they have a high expectation

324
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,800
on our group.

325
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,400
There are

326
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
some minor details

327
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
to amend in the contract.

328
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
After getting it done,

329
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,160
it can be audited.

330
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,920
No problem.

331
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,960
Then, I'll make a move.

332
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,520
Alright.

333
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,380
[Ticket for a music festival]

334
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,220
[Ticket for a music festival]

335
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,840
Tell me about the condition.

336
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,960
I've reflected on it.

337
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,560
In the past,

338
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,120
I was too strict with you.

339
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,040
I hope that we can have

340
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,960
more interaction.

341
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,240
You

342
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,040
don't be too stubborn.

343
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
We are siblings.

344
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,120
I hope that

345
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,000
we can

346
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,880
live happily together.

347
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,880
Are you sick?

348
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm serious.

349
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
Did you get counseling

350
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,960
or something like

351
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,200
teenage mental lessons?

352
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,280
You're really something.

353
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
Do you want to join the music festival?

354
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,480
Alright!

355
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,280
Your attitude should be praised.

356
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
Since I behave well,

357
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,560
should you do something?

358
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
So is it a deal?

359
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,840
Not a deal.

360
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,800
We're siblings.

361
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,560
There's no trade

362
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,320
between siblings.

363
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
I have a little expectation

364
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
on you.

365
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,720
What expectation?

366
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,040
Add me back on WeChat.

367
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,920
Don't delete my contact.

368
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,680
Deal.

369
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,240
Happy?

370
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,360
Quite.

371
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,320
Not making trouble?

372
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,560
Come.

373
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,160
I avoided it.

374
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,520
Childish.

375
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,160
Are you going with me?

376
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,080
Yes.

377
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,200
If not, why did I buy two tickets?

378
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,280
Here's your reward.

379
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,200
Let's eat.

380
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm here.

381
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,160
I thought you aren't at home.

382
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Why didn't you call me

383
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,440
before coming?

384
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,840
Come in.

385
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,440
Going for a trip?

386
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,880
Yes.

387
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,920
Thank you.

388
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,560
When will you return?

389
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,600
What's up?

390
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,280
I want to meet you.

391
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,200
Do you think that

392
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I want to meet you?

393
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,200
You don't want to meet me?

394
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,800
Have you been in a relationship?

395
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,080
Yes.

396
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm sure.

397
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,520
So?

398
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,960
So,

399
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,880
enjoy your vacation.

400
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll think of a way

401
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,960
to get you back

402
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,800
after you return.

403
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm leaving.

404
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,560
Wait.

405
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:43,880
Come back.

406
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,520
What is it?

407
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,200
When did I say that

408
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,040
you can pursue me?

409
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
You said that.

410
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,720
Did I remember it wrongly?

411
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,640
Do you really like me?

412
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,120
Yes.

413
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,840
What's the reason?

414
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,360
I…

415
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,560
Coco.

416
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
Are you getting fatter?

417
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,600
You can't even get to the couch.

418
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,240
Coco.

419
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,240
Coco. Look at this.

420
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,280
I like you.

421
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
You look at this.

422
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,920
I like you.

423
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,440
Sorry.

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,440
I…

425
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,760
Don't say it again.

426
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
Please go back home.

427
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,240
Take care.

428
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm leaving.

429
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,680
Are you okay, Coco?

430
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,600
Yes.

431
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,200
I can fit it after taking off the sweater.

432
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,080
It looks great.

433
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,800
We're like a match.

434
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,640
It's just a music festival.

435
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,600
Why do you buy so many shirts?

436
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,320
Do you

437
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,280
have too much pocket money?

438
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,400
Forget about it.

439
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,040
What can I buy with your pocket money?

440
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,880
There is

441
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,800
promotion now, OK?

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,560
Don't worry. They are good brands.

443
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
Try it on.

444
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,080
Hey.

445
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,000
President Song, there's something wrong

446
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,200
with the acquisition.

447
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,240
I have to report to you

448
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,120
immediately.

449
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
What's wrong?

450
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,520
President Sun told me,

451
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,680
while the contract was being amended

452
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,040
by the acquisition team,

453
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,600
the person in charge

454
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
has met Wan Cheng Group

455
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,200
personally.

456
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
I suspect that

457
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,560
Su Yu Shan was playing tricks.

458
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,040
It's related

459
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,920
to the strategy of

460
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,040
our overseas warehouse.

461
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,000
So, I think that it's urgent.

462
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,720
Alright. I'll check it.

463
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,720
It's fine too.

464
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,160
You can't go, right?

465
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
Something happened to the company.

466
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:21,880
I'll ask my friend

467
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,480
to accompany you.

468
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,680
I know that

469
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,760
there are many music festivals this year.

470
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
I'll go with you next time, okay?

471
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,020
[Yokohama, Japan]

472
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,840
You're here, President Song.

473
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
How's it going?

474
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Last night,

475
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,120
I contacted our staff

476
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,040
of the overseas warehouse.

477
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,600
They wouldn't expect that

478
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,960
we would do it.

479
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,120
Since they've taken action,

480
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,760
we have no choice

481
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,280
but to counter it.

482
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,440
You're brilliant and decisive.

483
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,480
Mr. Kimura.

484
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,080
Sorry for waiting, President Song.

485
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm sorry

486
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
to trouble you.

487
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
I really appreciate it.

488
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Do you speak Mandarin?

489
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,720
President Song.

490
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry

491
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,240
to trouble you.

492
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,840
I really appreciate it.

493
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,320
No big deal.

494
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
You're too humble.

495
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,160
You're good at joking, President Song.

496
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,280
I'm not joking.

497
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,400
I thought that you wouldn't

498
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,320
break your promise.

499
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,520
I never thought that

500
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,320
you're…

501
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
Actually, you got me wrong.

502
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,400
I...

503
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
got no choice.

504
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,640
Yes.

505
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
What price was given by them?

506
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,720
This…

507
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,480
Are you making things difficult?

508
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,120
Am I?

509
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
It's difficult for you to keep your promise.

510
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,040
Is setting a new price difficult for you too?

511
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,880
Sorry. I have something to do.

512
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,680
I need to leave now.

513
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,960
Let's talk about it next time.

514
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,880
Mr. Kimura.

515
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,200
You don't have to go.

516
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,280
I've held your boat.

517
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,520
It's against the rules.

518
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,520
I wish to have a peace talk too.

519
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,520
Unexpectedly, it didn't work well.

520
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,160
I don't mean it.

521
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,880
I…It's my mistake. I…

522
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,320
It's alright.

523
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,480
I will reject them.

524
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,520
It's useless to reject them.

525
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,800
I never mean to sign the contract with you.

526
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,960
Ask the staff of Wan Cheng

527
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,520

Okay.

What's that?

530
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,800
It's

531
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,120
something personal.

532
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,000
It's not your business.

533
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,760
Carry on with your work.

534

Okay.

Look at yourself.

You have a straight nose,

beautiful eyes,

538
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,320
and a perfect body figure.

539
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,320
Why did no one approach you?

540
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
I've posted it on website

541

for a few days.

542

be attracted by you.

I'll send you there.

I wish you good luck.

You can avoid it now

560
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,600
but not later.

561
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
You have to face it one day.

562
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,440
Okay. Please listen to your mum.

563

She didn't eat what I cooked.

568
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,000
I called her,

569
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,840
but she didn't answer my call.

570
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,120
I'm afraid that

she gets into trouble again.

572

Why didn't I

577
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,680
meet them before?

578
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,040
I just knew them.

579
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,040
It's fine.

Let your brother not find you.

Then, he'll be good to you.

586

Sorry.

They are the people who made trouble last time.

I often saw

614

them being together.

615
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
They don't look like students.

616
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,000
How about you call

So, he called me.

He's calling me again. A moment.

622

I know it.

623
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,120

to locate her position.

How did you locate her position?

It's fine.

629

her location could be known
before she turned it off.

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,640
Thank you.

706
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,240
Luo Luo.

707
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,960
I don't want to talk to you now.

708
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,320
Come here.

709
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,040
I mean it!

710
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
I don't want to talk to you now.

711
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,800
If you don't,

712
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
what do you want?

713
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,880
Do you want to

714
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,560
get along with your bad friends?

715
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Look at yourself.

716
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,280
Do you look like a student?

717
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Look at yourself!

718
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,120
Turn around.

719
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,480
Go out!

720
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,040
If Zhou Fang didn't make it on time,

721
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,000
do you know the consequence?

722
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,600
Do you know?

723
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,560
I tell you.

724
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,240
From today onwards,

725
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,360
don't get out of the house.

726
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,080
Got it?

727
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,120
Then, I'll charge you for detaining me illegally!

728
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,600
Charge me?

729
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
You're so powerful now, right?

730
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,960
Alright. Alright. Alright.

731
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,680
Come. Go out.

732
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,600
Let her rest.

733
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,480
Go out.

734
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,360
What's wrong?

735
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
Can you calm down?

736
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,800
How could I keep calm?

737
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,960
How am I supposed to calm down?

738
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,160
You're right.

739
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,960
But you can't

740
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
talk to her in this way.

741
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,800
Then, how should I talk to her?

742
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,120
You mean that I can't be fierce.

743
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,400
I have to give what she wants.

744
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,000
I did it.

745
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,960
What's the result?

746
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,120
She made a mistake.

747
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,640
I must let her know it.

748
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
Keep calm, okay?

749
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,520
It's right to let her know.

750
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,520
But she is a girl,

751
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,720
and it's just happened to her.

752
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Will she listen to you

753
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,120
if you scold her?

754
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,000
You have to go to

755
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,160
the police station.

756
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,120
I got it.

757
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,200
I won't let him escape from this.

758
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,040
You enter first.

759
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,280
I'll come later.

760
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,320
Go.

761
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,080
Luo Luo.

762
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,440
Come and eat.

763
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,320
Luo Luo.

764
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,960
I'm not hungry.

765
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,800
Eat something.

766
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,840
It's almost done.

767
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,240
We're ready to move.

768
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,600
Don't move today.

769
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,520
I've called the mover.

770
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,600
They will come tomorrow.

771
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,800
Why did you get the mover?

772
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,040
We're here.

773
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,920
What are you afraid of?

774
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,400
I don't want to trouble you all.

775
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,880
We have money.

776
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,760
Thank you, Miss Fang.

777
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,760
Be careful.

778
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,120
Hello. Who are you looking for?

779
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,240
Miss Fang.

780
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,760
Why are you here?

781
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
What are you doing?

782
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,760
We're moving the office.

783
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,160
This office is too big.

784
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,440
There are only four of us now.

785
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,600
We're moving to a smaller office.

786
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,800
Where?

787
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,040
Outskirt.

788
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,040
It's a warehouse.

789
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,360
What's wrong? Anything?

790
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
Treat you a meal.

791
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,320
What a surprise.

792
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,360
What's the reason?

793
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,720
It's for Luo Luo.

794
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,640
Thank you.

795
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,600
No big deal.

796
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,040
You don't worry.

797
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,160
How's her condition?

798
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,360
She's fine.

799
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,840
I ask her

800
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,640
to rest at home.

801
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,760
Miss Fang.

802
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,600
Your mum's calling.

803
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,700
[Mum]

804
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,800
At this moment.

805
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,080
Mum.

806
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,880
Have you done your things?

807
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,480
Not yet. It's still early.

808
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,640
Don't try to skip it.

809
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
If you

810
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,320
don't attend the blind date in the afternoon,

811
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,600
I'll make sure that

812
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
you can't enter this house

813
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,160
from today onwards.

814
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
Got it?

815
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,480
Don't be late!

816
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,920
I'll wait for you there this afternoon.

817
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,280
You got the address?

818
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,000
No.

819
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,480
Didn't your dad send it to you?

820
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,840
I…

821
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,680
I… I'll ask him

822
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,560
to send it to you.

823
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,280
Now!

824
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,600
Old man!

825
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,480
Can't get a boyfriend?

826
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,040
Have you ever attended a blind date?

827
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,680
I never had such an opportunity.

828
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
You're lucky.

829
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,860
[The blind date location]

830
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,360
So far, it's about 40 minutes.

831
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,040
Blind date?

832
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,120
You saw it.

833
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,520
I'm not free to eat with you.

834
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,480
More than 100 gentlemen

835
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,640
are waiting for me.

836
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,800
I'm leaving now.

837
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,160
I've done.

838
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,520
It's fine to leave the rest.

839
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,120
The mover will come tomorrow.

840
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,280
Take a rest.

841
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
Okay. Bye, Miss Fang.

842
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,200
Are you staying?

843
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,600
Bye-bye.

844
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,680
Bye-bye.

845
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
Is he Miss Fang's new boyfriend?

846
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,360
Yes.

847
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,720
What a good fashion sense.

848
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,600
So handsome.

849
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,080
Look at yourselves.

850
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,640
Which part of him is better than me,

851
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,880
other than height?

852
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,320
He's better than you overall.

853
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,280
You all don't have good taste.

854
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,960
Really.

855
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,680
No wonder you all are still single.

856
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Wish you all to be single forever.

857
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,600
There's a saying.

858
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,720
Some people are destined to meet.

859
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,000
Talking about myself,

860
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,920
I'm a straightforward person.

861
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,160
Let's get straight to the point.

862
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,040
I lack nothing

863
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,360
but a son.

864
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,760
My hobby

865
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,120
is writing poem

866
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,280
and listening to symphonies.

867
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Miss Zhou, do you know about

868
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,880
Tchaikovsky?

869
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,160
It's fine

870
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,120
if you don't know him.

871
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,520
Miss Zhou.

872
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
if we are together,

873
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,400
I'll make sure that

874
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,640
you'll love symphonies.

875
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,480
Miss Zhou.

876
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,880
Your skin's flawless.

877
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,120
You're really pretty.

878
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,960
Don't be afraid.

879
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,000
Don't judge a book

880
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
by its cover.

881
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,160
Actually, I'm

882
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,640
a real man.

883
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,560
Hello, Miss Zhou Fang.

884
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,600
I'm Song Lin.

885
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,320
Why are you so free

886
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,040
today?

887
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,560
How's your result?

888
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,720
No result.

889
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,200
That's expected.

890
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,280
Why are you here?

891
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,120
Because of curiosity.

892
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,880
What are you curious about?

893
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,760
Forget about it.

894
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
You're here to laugh at me.

895
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,800
Hey, don't be so angry

896
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,880
talking to me.

897
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,480
Okay?

898
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
How to attract a man

899
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
if you behave like this?

900
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,240
Do I need that?

901
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,320
Since you don't need them,

902
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,240
what's the reason being here?

903
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
You're given two options.

904
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
You either go out

905
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,800
with me now,

906
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,000
or

907
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,920
continue your blind date at here.

908
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,720
Excuse me.

909
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,640
What are you doing?

910
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,000
Please wait for me.

911
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,920
What are you doing?

912
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,280
Where are you going?

913
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,280
I… I… Go…

914
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,800
Go out for a while.

915
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,520
Hello, aunt.

916
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,520
Hello.

917
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,800
What a pleasing talking, right?

918
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Yes.

919
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:17,840
Aunt.

920
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,640
Do you want to go out?

921
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,240
No. No. No.

922
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,360
It's fine.

923
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,720
You… You… You…

924
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,480
Both you go.

925
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
Perform well.

926
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,560
Go.

927
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,440
Then, we're leaving.

928
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,960
Okay, then… Okay.

929
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,840
I got it.

930
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,120
That…

931
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,360
Handsome guy.

932
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,640
I… I…

933
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,120
Come.

934
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,600
Let me ask you something.

935
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,360
That… Just now, that…

936
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,640
Okay.

937
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,200
Okay, mum, I'm hanging up.

938
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,320
She's worried about you?

939
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,560
No.

940
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,000
She asked

941
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,880
about us.

942
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,360
She takes it seriously.

943
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,920
It's a pleasing talking.

944
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,640
I told her that we're not having a good talk.

945
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,840
Which part is not good?

946
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,040
What's wrong

947
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,080
between you and your sister?

948
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,360
You told me that

949
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
my education method was wrong, right?

950
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,800
I thought to make a change.

951
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,520
I wanted to join a music festival with her.

952
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,120
To have fun.

953
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,640
But

954
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,520
I was busy with work.

955
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,800
So, you broke your promise?

956
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,640
Yes.

957
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,280
Actually, it's reasonable

958
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,760
for Luo Luo to be angry.

959
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,440
She cares about you very much.

960
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,400
She counts on you.

961
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,720
I didn't accompany her often.

962
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,880
That day, at the hospital,

963
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,040
it was so obvious.

964
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,840
Normally,

965
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,600
she's afraid of nothing.

966
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,760
She's active,

967
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,800
yet she's lonely.

968
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,360
She has you only.

969
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,040
Your burden must be

970
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,080
quite heavy.

971
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,520
Why are you looking at me?

972
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,560
Nothing.

973
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,640
Don't you think that

974
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,440
you have to thank me

975
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,760
since I've helped you

976
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,520
so much?

977
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,040
Yes. Yes.

978
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,760
Not only this,

979
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
you helped a lot

980
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,720
in the case of Wang Ze Yang as well.

981
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Then, you look into my eyes

982
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,440
and thank me sincerely.

983
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,560
You were so

984
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,400
arrogant before.

985
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,800
You've been so sarcastic to me.

986
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,680
I'd like to see

987
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,640
the way

988
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,760
you thank someone sincerely.

989
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,440
Actually, I have another problem.

990
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,800
What is it again?

991
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,640
Since Luo Luo returned from the hospital,

992
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,960
she refuses to eat

993
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,880
or gets out from her bedroom.

994
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,640
She refuses to talk to me.

995
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,440
Then, you're still able to

996
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,520
drink coffee with me?

997
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,680
Aren't good at

998
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,240
talking with kids?

999
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,320
Help me.

1000
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,920
Before that,

1001
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,640
please thank me sincerely.

1002
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,640
I'll think

1003
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,760
of a way.

1004
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,160
Zhou Fang.

1005
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,920
