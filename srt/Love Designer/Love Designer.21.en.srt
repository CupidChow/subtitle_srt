we should stand up for Miss Fang.

164
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480

Most importantly,

171

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,080
Miss Fang is always so unlucky.

175
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,800
Why do people keep picking on her?

176
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,360
The shareholders of our company

177
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,280
are usually gentle and decent.

178
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
But when benefits are at stake,

179
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,000
they turn into demons.

180
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
No one would want to see

181
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
a stranger

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,240
destroy their business.

183
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,240
It's understandable.

184
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
You really came back?

185
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,160
Yeah.

186
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
You got into this mess.

187
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,640
Of course, I have to come back.

188
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,200
The floor is cold!

189

-I'm so sleepy.
-Let's go.

190

Let me get you

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,600
in a hot bath.

192
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,080

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,000

Don't sleep here,

196
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,080
you'll catch a cold.

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,680
Sleep in your room.

198
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
It's okay. You go to sleep.

199
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
No. Go.

200
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,200
Go back to your room.

201
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,080

How old are you?

You don't even know to sleep in your room?

205

Hello, Chen Chen.

A decision has been made for that matter?

207

Okay, I know. OK.

208
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,320
It's early in the morning. Who was that?

215

I can't even have fun in peace.

216
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,800
Then, I'll be your mom in my next life

217

That sounds good.

219

Later, I'll go back home.

220

222
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,960
Okay. Continue your sleep.

231

The password is correct.

Okay. Thank you.

What should I explain?

break up?

We broke up again?

349
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,960
press conference.

350
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,360

353
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,720
Recently,

354
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,720
there were rumors about

355
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,840
a designer of Wan Feng Group

356
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,200
involving in plagiarism.

357
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,520
Our collaborative partners

358
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
have been negatively impacted.

359
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,480
And our friends, who have been

360
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,400
supporting Wan Feng Group,

361
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,520
were also faced with

362
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,720
immeasurable loss.

363
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,680
I hereby

364
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,880

365
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,880
and apologize to everyone.

366
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,720
Besides, I would

367
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,760
like to emphasize that

368
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
designer Zhou Fang,

369
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,360

370
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,280
this competition

371
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,480
have no relation to Wan Feng Group.

372
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,400
We will do our best to assist in the investigation

373
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,280
on whether Zhou Fang is involved

374
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,960
in plagiarism.

375
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,280
If she is indeed involved,

376
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,640
Wan Feng Group

377
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000

378
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
collaboration with Zhou Fang.

379
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,520
For you,

380
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
this issue might

381
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,920
make you more popular.

382
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,920
But for

383
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,400
President Song,

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,160
it's different.

385
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,760
He doesn't speak for himself only.

386
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,600
He can't choose to protect

387
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,360
your reputation

388
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,560
and allow our competitors

389
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,440
to take advantage of us.

390
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,400
If I put it this way,

391
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,240
you might think that

392
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm just making a fuss.

393
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,760
But after all, none of us

394
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,520
is at that position.

395
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,760

I'm out. I'm on my way.

How was it? I was right, wasn't I?

401
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,805
This is Song Lin's plan.

402
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:20,885
He wanted to make a fool of you,

403
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:21,925
so he calmed you down first.

404

I can't talk now. I'm driving.

409
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:31,845
Okay.

410
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,485
Song Lin

411
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,285
doesn't care a bit about you.

412
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,485
He's capricious.

413
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,445
He didn't have a choice.

414
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,725
He was forced to.

415
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,365
The whole company also understand him.

416
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,285
Even now,

417
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:51,605
you're standing up for him?

418
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,165
They're in the same gang.

419
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:54,165
How can you believe them?

420
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:55,685
That was their scheme.

421
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,125
Now, they're

422
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,725
trying to brainwash and

423
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,285
cut ties with you at the same time

424
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,405
to save themselves. Do you understand?

425
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:03,285
The fact that he can pull it off

426
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,765
means he's rational and objective.

427
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,085
He's a qualified businessman.

428
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,445
But this is also why

429
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:08,525
I feel very disappointed.

430
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,045
This is because you had

431
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,445
high expectation of Song Lin.

432
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,125
Yes. I admit.

433

Sometimes, you two

434
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,645
do get along pretty well.

435
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:16,765
There was even

some chemistry between you two.

437
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,245
You two dated for a short while.

438

So what?

Do you understand him?

00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,525
It's all your imagination.

441
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,085
I didn't imagine anything.

442
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,325
Put a sock in it.

443
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:29,805
Those ideas you have in your mind,

444
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:31,485
I don't even want to expose you.

445
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:33,165
You always say

446
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,525
he puts on a dark face.

447
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:35,925
I think he's dark

448
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:37,725
all over from his face to his heart.

449
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:38,805
He's just a black-hearted person.

450
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,485
With his character,

451
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,005
even if you work with him,

452
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:42,365
you'll have

453
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:43,525
to constantly watch your back.

454
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,085
Not to mention dating him.

455
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,045
With that your small brain,

456
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:49,365
you don't suit each other.

457
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,845
Our relationship is in the past.

458
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,405
It'll just be work from now on.

459
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:55,365
Still, it's not suitable.

460
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:56,965
I'll tell you this.

461
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,565
Even if he comes and begs you,

462
00:20:58,605 --> 00:20:59,645
don't work with him anymore.

463
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:00,965
Who knows

464
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,085
if anything happens next time,

465
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:02,925
he might let you take the blame.

466
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,005
After

467
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,205
all the problems this time,

468
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,005
there won't be next time.

469
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,445
It's okay. I'll just start all over again.

470
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:12,845
I'm used to it anyway.

471
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:15,125
My dear Fang.

472
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:16,885
Why do you keep starting all over

473

again and again?

474

the starting line.

476
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,085
In my opinion,

477
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:23,165
it must be

478
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,485
because of that jinx, Song Lin.

479

Don't contact him anymore.

480

good that this happened.

I had it too easy.

Well, about the press conference...

532
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,045
I completely understand.

533
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:31,605
No, no, no.

534
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:32,845
Let me explain.

535
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:34,885
I think you made the right move.

536
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:36,085
Anyone would have

537
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:37,325
made the same choice.

538
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:39,325
I can understand.

539
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,925
You should go back and rest.

540
00:26:46,765 --> 00:26:48,165
Although I'm still not sure

541
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:49,085
what the rumormongers

542
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:50,285
plan to do next,

543
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,365
we can be sure that

544
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:53,805
for this period,

545
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,405
the media won't come and bother us,

546
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:56,965
and the PR team will investigate.

547
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:58,885
So, don't panic.

548
00:26:58,885 --> 00:26:59,605
Hang in there.

549
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,005
Reassure your staff.

550
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:02,925
If you have orders, work on them.

551
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,005
I'll still give you all the support.

552
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,045
It'll just be in another form.

553
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:09,285
Song Lin.

554
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:12,885
Let's not work together anymore.

555
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:14,165
No matter

556
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,205
in what form.

557
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:17,925
Are you scared that I'll hold you back?

558
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:19,365
No.

559
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:21,205
I'm the one holding you back.

560
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:24,245
Although a small brand like mine

561
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:24,965
has no

562
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:25,685
significance at all.

563
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,165
The reality is

564
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:28,005
there is always someone

565
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:28,925
picking on me.

566
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:30,685
I'm getting a bit tired.

567
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:35,005
I guess I did hold you back.

568
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:40,285
This kind of situation...I can understand.

569
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,165
Every time you want to

570
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:43,045
to do something,

571
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,165
there would be issues.

572
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:46,765
No one can stand that.

573
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:49,685
I only wanted to

574
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:50,285
work on

575
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:51,725
my own fashion brand.

576
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:53,365
But there would

577
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:54,005
always be

578
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,125
problems out of work.

579
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,165
You only wanted to

580
00:27:58,165 --> 00:27:59,125
manage your business as well.

581
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:02,365
But there would always be

582
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:03,925
problems.

583
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:05,165
And every time

584
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:07,405
these problems are complicated

585
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:08,285
and troublesome.

586
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:09,885
From now on,

587
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,045
I'll let go of you

588
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:14,965
and you'll let go of me.

589
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:16,725
Let's not work together anymore.

590
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,165
If you have nothing else, you should go back.

591
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:25,925
I still have work.

592
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:27,645
I have something.

593
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:28,605
What?

594
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,525
Let's get back together.

595
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:43,005
Why should we get back together?

596
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,965
Because I need you.

597
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:46,725
I need you to be by my side.

598
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:48,165
I want you to be my friend.

599
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:48,765
I want us

600
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:49,765
to stay together forever.

601
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,165
I don't agree.

602
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,965
You don't like me?

603
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:25,885
I like you.

604
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:27,485
If you like me,

605
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:28,165
why can't we be together?

606
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,445
We can't be together.

607
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:38,165
What are your thoughts?

608
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:39,005
Tell me.

609
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,285
Splitting and getting back together is tiring.

610
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,325
We're not kids anymore.

611
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,045
We should use

612
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,085
this energy for our work.

613
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,445
I can't accept this reason.

614
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:53,525
If you have any worries, tell me directly.

615
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:58,725
Your life is filled with

616
00:29:58,725 --> 00:29:59,645
uncertainties,

617
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,125
most of which

618
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,085
are not surprises,

619
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:03,845
but shock.

620
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:06,525
I'm not sure if I can take it.

621
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:12,445
The press conference

622
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:14,125
made you insecure, didn't it?

623
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:16,605
You feel that

624
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,685
if you're with me,

625
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:19,965
I might push you out to be

626
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,205
the scapegoat anytime.

627
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,405
You think I'd put the company's benefit

628
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,485
above anything else.

629
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:27,365
Even the closest people,

630
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:29,445
I can sacrifice them.

631
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:31,045
am I right?

632
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:36,485
Actually, compared with being with you,

633
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,605
I'm more eager to achieve my dream.

634
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:47,685
Thank you.

635
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:51,485

Lin,

655
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:26,165
the contract for

656
00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:26,885
the AR project is done.

657
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:27,685
Have a look.

658
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:29,165
Sure.

659
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:31,405
Just put it here.

660
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:34,005
Are you sure to invest

661
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,245
in Xiao Fei's tech company?

662
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:37,805
What's the problem?

663
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:40,925
The board of directors...

664
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:42,125
They're not optimistic about

665
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:42,685
this project.

666
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:44,525
They feel that it's a high-risk investment.

667
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,445
Plus, the research and development fund

668
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:47,245
would be bottomless.

669
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:50,405
You're quick with your information.

670
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,285
So, would you like to

671
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:54,445
think it over again?

672
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:55,845
Not a problem.

673
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:57,725
This time,

674
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,845
I'll invest under my own name.

675
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,525
It has nothing to do with
the benefits of others.

676
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,125
You're investing under your own name?

677
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:04,685
That would be a higher risk for you.

678
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:05,605
What if...

679
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:07,525
So, no what-ifs.

680
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:09,485
The quality of the rest of my life

681
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:10,245
depends on you.

682
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:11,525
Do your best.

683
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,045
Thank you, Lin.

Luo Luo.

Come out!

689
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:22,125
What?

690
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,285
What is this?

691
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:26,085
Aren't you asking the obvious?

692
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,125
It's for Zhou Fang to see.

693
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,165
You thought it was a talisman?

694
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,045
[Do you miss me?]
You're just a kid.

695
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,445
Stop meddling in our situation.

696
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:33,645
The exam is coming.

697
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:34,365
You've done your revision?

698
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:36,765
You just wait for your defeat.

699
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,525
I'll definitely make it into the top ten.

700
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:40,445
Come back.

701
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:42,525
What now?

702
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:43,525
How do you plan to defeat me?

703
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,525
Here. Write it in English.

704
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,445
Write what?

705
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:51,565
Write 'I miss you'.

706
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:54,805
I thought what I'd be writing.

707
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:04,485
Draw the heart yourself.

708
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,245
Sleep early.

709
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:07,965
You're the one who wrote it.

710
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,005
I know.

711
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:32,644
[I Miss You!]

712
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,548
[I Miss You!]

713
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,000
[I Miss You!]

714
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:01,925
Zhou Fang. Hello.

715
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,125
I'm a reporter from Entertainment On-the-go.

716
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:03,685
About the plagiarism,

717
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:04,645
can you answer us in detail?

718
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,565
During the press conference,

719
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:06,445
the splitting of

720
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:07,165
you and your brand

721
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:08,245
is rumored to be a cover-up

722
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,245
by the president of Wan Feng Group

723
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:09,965
to hide his relationship.

724
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,365
Can you tell us more about it?

725
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:11,925
Can you tell us more?

726
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:12,605
Excuse me.

727
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,165
Please tell us.

728
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:13,685
Excuse me.

729
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:14,165
We've waited a long time.

730
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:14,605
Excuse me.

731
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:15,725
Please make way. Please make way.

732
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:16,445
Excuse me.

733
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:17,205
Excuse me. Excuse me.

734
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,605
This is our private space.

735
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:19,365
We need to work.

736
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:19,725
Miss Zhou!

737
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:36,565
So, our

738
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,565
collaboration with Wan Feng group

739
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:38,725
has come to an end.

740
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:41,485
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,725
Before this,

742
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:45,165
I lifted your hopes.

743
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:45,885
I said I'd bring

744
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,165
you to the top.

745
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:49,685
In a few days, it became like this.

746
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:51,725
You must be disappointed.

747
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,205
Miss Fang, it is not a big deal.

748
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:56,405
Nowadays, many people use

749
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,565
scandals to hype themselves up.

750
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:58,245
We'll just

751
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,205
whitewash ourselves next time.

752
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:00,485
Perfect.

753
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:01,965
That's right.

754
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:04,525
Look. Even You You understands it.

755
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:06,285
Don't be unhappy.

756
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:08,805
We...We're not disappointed at all!

757
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:09,285
Right?

758
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:10,645
We got promoted and a pay raise.

759
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:11,605
We're happy.

760
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:12,965
That's right, Miss Fang.

761
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:15,485
Are you not

762
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:16,885
giving us the promotion anymore?

763
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:19,125
How would I? I'm not that kind of person.

764
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:20,125
That's good then.

765
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,125
If you have any problems,

766
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,245
let us know.

767
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:24,445
Four people

768
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:25,725
are always stronger than one.

769
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:26,005
Right?

770
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:26,485
Exactly!

771
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:27,285
We've been defamed

772
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,085
for so many times now.

773
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:29,525
The more they do it, the more amazing we get.

774
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,525
Yes. There's a phrase...

775
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:32,525
What is it again?

776
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:34,125
It's right at the tip of my tongue.

777
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:35,525
It's a proverb that sounds like...

778
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:37,365
It's like the more something,

779
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,485
the more something.

780
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:39,845
The more setbacks there are,
the more one rises.

781
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:41,285
Yes! The more setbacks there are, the more one rises!

782
00:38:59,005 --> 00:38:59,805
In the morning, Qin Qing

783
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:00,925
sent me a few WeChat messages

784
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:02,005
to ask about Zhou Fang.

785
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:03,445
I can tell that

786
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:04,285
you really care

787
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:05,085
about Zhou Fang.

788
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:06,365
Yeah.

789
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:08,165
But the things we can do

790
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:08,885
are very limited.

791
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,205
We're mainly counting on you.

792
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:12,005
I've been sending out

793
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:13,045
lawyer's letter one by one.

794
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,165
I believe that it should stop part of

795
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:16,125
the online defamation.

796
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:17,525
But as for your company

797
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:19,205
and Zhou Fang's brand,

798
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,005
the damage of reputation is more serious.

799
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:21,925
To stop the damage,

800
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:23,165
I advise you to

801
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:24,285
make use of publicity.

802
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,845
In terms of this, I'll find someone to handle it.

803
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,005
But you really have to

804
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:28,805
work hard from your side.

805
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:29,285
I can see that

806
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,285
the situation is very serious.

807
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,205
The main point is Wan Feng Group.

808
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:33,525
Damage in reputation

809
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:34,685
of an enterprise

810
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,085
can be a deadly blow.

811
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:37,285
Don't focus on one and neglect the other,

812
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:38,725
because of Zhou Fang,

813
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:39,885
Wan Feng gets neglected.

814
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:42,605
I'm not worried about the company.

815
00:39:42,605 --> 00:39:43,245
There are so many of us,

816
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:44,485
so many shareholders keeping an eye on it.

817
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:46,885
Zhou Fang's side, I need to help her.

818
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:47,845
So, you got to work hard,

819
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:48,365
brother.

820
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:49,925
I understand.

821
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:51,285
I know what to do.

822
00:39:59,045 --> 00:40:01,045
Miss Fang, in terms of crisis communication,

823
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:01,925
don't worry.

824
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:02,845
I'll do my best.

825
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:04,645
But the most important thing is

826
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:05,325
to solve

827
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:06,085
the source of the problem.

828
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,885
Lawyer Shen

829
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,005
is helping us

830
00:40:10,005 --> 00:40:10,885
to think of a way.

831
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,565
As for Izumino,

832
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:13,965
I need to find a way myself.

833
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:16,285
But Lawyer Shen...

834
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:17,645
I feel embarrassed to

835
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:18,765
trouble him again.

836
00:40:18,885 --> 00:40:19,885
After all, he is from

837
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,205
the top law firm in the country.

838
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:22,685
Just trouble him if you need.

839
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:23,725
He and I have been good friends

840
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:24,365
for more than 10 years.

841
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:26,005
He's your friend.

842
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:26,885
It's okay if he's helping you.

843
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:27,685
Isn't he

844
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:28,885
helping me with my problems now?

845
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:30,725
Don't overthink it.

846
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:32,805
Miss Qing.

847
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:34,765
This Lawyer Shen...

848
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,045
is in love with you?

849
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:37,845
We're just

850
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:38,725
friends.

851
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,365
Is it time for gossip?

852
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:47,045
In short, for Lawyer Shen,

853
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,005
please help me

854
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:48,925
talk to him.

855
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:51,005
As for Izumino,

856
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:52,605
I believe I can handle it.

857
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,005
You're confident about it?

858
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:55,245
I have to.

859
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:56,245
After all, she stole

860
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,285
the original sketch of my design.

861
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:58,445
For this matter,

862
00:40:58,445 --> 00:40:59,365
my company and I

863
00:40:59,365 --> 00:40:59,965
clearly wasn't

864
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:01,485
involved in foul playing.

865
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:02,685
Hence, we take

866
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:03,445
a solid stance.

867
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:05,205
The innocent will always be innocent.

868
00:41:05,725 --> 00:41:07,325
The truth can't be concealed forever.

869
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:10,925
After this incident is over,

870
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,325
I'll need to change my company name

871
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:13,485
to Da Feng Da Lang*.
(*Lit.: Great upheavals)

872
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:14,805
After all, this year

873
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,845
has been too thrilling.

874
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:17,685
Even at this point,

875
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:19,285
you have the mood to mock yourself.

876
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:21,045
But...

877
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:23,605
What about your new releases?

878
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:25,565
Are they taken down from the stores?

879
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,165
I have a solution.

880
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:31,205
Didn't I have

881
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,125
an old online store?

882
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,165
I plan to sell

883
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,205
those remaining clothes

884
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,365
on that online store.

885
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:36,925
But I should still

886
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:38,045
inform Wan Feng group first.

887
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:39,565
After all,

888
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:40,485
we signed a contract.

889
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:42,085
This company...

890
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:44,285
Not only did they not help you at crucial times,

891
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:45,605
they even got you

892
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:46,525
into so many troubles.

893
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:47,845
I think you should terminate the contract.

894
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:50,125
That's too harsh.

895
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:51,125
After all,

896
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:52,965
they did help out before.

897
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:54,725
Did you add a camera filter*
(*Lit.: To beautify)

898
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:55,765
for Song Lin?

899
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,485
He didn't protect you at this crucial moment

900
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:58,845
and you still cover for him?

901
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:01,565
Miss Qing.

902
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:03,725
I think that

903
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:05,045
President Song's crisis management

904
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,565
was actually correct.

905
00:42:07,005 --> 00:42:08,445
I don't care whether he's correct.

906
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:09,445
Anyway, he got Zhou Fang

907
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,205
into this mess.

908
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:12,685
I feel that

909
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:13,885
as long as it's love,

910
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,045
you'll get hurt one way or another.

911
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:16,085
It's either

912
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:17,165
you're hurt by someone you don't love,

913
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,765
or you're hurt by someone you do love.

914
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:22,205
If it's me, I'd rather choose the latter.

915
00:42:22,445 --> 00:42:23,805
At least, I'm willing to.

916
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:25,285
You're hopeless.

917
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:31,085
Zhou Fang, where are you?

918
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:32,485
Come back now.

919
00:42:32,805 --> 00:42:33,845
I need to talk to you.

920
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:35,725
I need to go back again.

921
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:37,525
