26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
This hotel's environment is quite nice.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,160
Yes, yes, not bad.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,320
Director Li, Tian.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,480
I'm going upstairs now.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,360
Miss Ru Hui,

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,040
You're not

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,440
sharing a room with Ms Shen?

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,760
She has neurasthenia,

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,200
and I need to get up at night to go to the toilet.

35
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,320
I'm afraid we both

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,560
might disturb each other.

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,040
If you don't mind,

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,840
why don't we

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,720
share a room?

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Of course, I don't mind.

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm just afraid that I will disturb you.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
You won't. I'm a good sleeper.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,120
Really?

44
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
Alright then. Let's share a room.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,479
We can have a chat.

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:09,960
Sure.

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,600
Ms Tian, I've checked with the receptionist.

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
The room on the south side is not near the street.

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
It's quieter.

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,000
I changed it especially for you.

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,880
Thanks.

Between teacher and student,

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,240
you two are quite close.

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,800
Here, let me get your suitcase.

57
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,880
You don't have to. I'll do it myself.

58
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Some of these futile attempts

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,720
are useless even if you do them.

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Ms Tian,

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,880
didn't you always tell me

62
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,680
where there's a will, there's a way?

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,120
I've always remembered that.

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,360
I believe

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,800
your teaching is surely right.

66
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,800
Here.

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
It's okay. I got it.

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
I...I think

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,520
the student has a point.

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
Let's go.

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Let's go. Come on.

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,840
Let's go. Let's go.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
is finally getting some rest,

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
and watching a movie at home,

76
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,560
how long do you plan to stay here?

77
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,160
Until Qin Qing

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,960
gives Miss Fang a call.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
If she doesn't?

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I'll go and look for her.

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
That's right. Go on.

82
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Don't wait.

83
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,480
That's enough. Stop teasing him.

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
Qin Qing doesn't answer WeChat messages,

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,880
and he doesn't dare to call her.

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
Just let him stay here.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
No, why don't you...

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,040
go inside and stay for a while?

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
Alright, alright.

90
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Lovey-dovey. Be lovey-dovey.

91
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
Such a bother.

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,320
For older people, at night,

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,080
you have to make some hot water for her,

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,800
understand?

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,040
Alright, I got it.

96
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,600
Pour in some cold water to make it warm,

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
and put it beside her bed.

98
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,240
Alright.

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,880
Aunt is also using this toothbrush?

100
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,360
It's a gift from Zhou Fang.

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,800
You have to remember

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,680
what I told you.

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
You have to be sharper at night,

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,800
understand?

105
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
I got it, don't worry.

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,840
Ms Tian.

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Miss Ru Hui.

108
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,240
What are you doing?

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,200
Let me tell you.

110
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,520
I only mentioned once that

111
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,960
at night,

112
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,120
I always get up to go to the toilet.

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,640
She immediately got anxious,

114
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,160
and said she's afraid it might affect you. I...

115
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,000
Did I tell you?

116
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
I am a good sleeper.

117
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Don't listen to her. Don't listen to her.

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,120
What...What are you doing?

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
You...Why are you anxious?

120
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,960
Am I?

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
A little. A little bit.

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
I don't want to bother you.

123
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
Not at all.

124
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
Qin Qing,

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
Thank you for the offer,

126
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
but I want to share a room

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,760
with Aunt Li.

128
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,520
We can have a chat at night.

129
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,840
As for the rest,

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
you don't need to worry about it.

131
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,280
Quickly go back and have some rest.

132
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,320
Ms Tian, wasn't I just worried that

133
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
you can't get enough rest,

134
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,480
and affect tomorrow's schedule?

135
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,200
Besides,

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,040
I would like to

137
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
talk with you.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,120
Right, talk.

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
It's common

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
for a teacher and a student.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,480
I tell you.

142
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,640
I'm really a troublemaker.

143
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,560
I wake up

144
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,520
often at night.

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,880
Alright. Let's do this.

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,800
Let me send you off.

147
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,760
Okay.

148
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,240
Be smart.

149
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,000
No worries.

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,920
Good night.

151
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,080
I'm telling you

152
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,760
your doings are annoying me more.

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
Please tell me

154
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,960
the ways

155
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,120
to get closer to you,

156
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,520
so that you can understand me better.

157
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
I think

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,760
I know you enough.

159
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,480
Ms Tian. Ten years

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,640
are sufficient for someone

161
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,600
to develop and change.

162
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Can we

163
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
be like

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
a teacher and a student

165
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
in these few days?

166
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,400
Please.

167
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,520
Miss Fang. Is that Qin Qing?

168
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Who ask you to come out?

169
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
Seriously.

170
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
Have already been in the tiger's den.

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
What does it mean?

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
It's dangerous.

173
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,520
Call Qin Qing now,

174
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,000
Miss Fang.

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
Why are you so anxious?

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,920
If a phone call could work,

177
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,880
would she send a text?

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
She would have called us.

179
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Why are you

180
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,000
so naive?

181
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,960
Seriously.

182
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,200
My mum has put Ms Tian and Qin Qing

183
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,960
in a room.

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
Really?

185
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,320
It's good. I think that it's a good thing.

186
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,880
It's good.

187
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,720
Go back.

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Both of you really…

189
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Are you going to sleep, Ms Tian?

190
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,760
It's not even 9 p.m. yet.

191
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,280
I usually sleep at this time.

192
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,120
Do you have any problem?

193
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,920
No.

194
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
I sleep

195
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,800
without light.

196
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
Your phone screen is too bright.

197
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm sleepy as well. I'm going to sleep now.

198
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
Next, we are going

199
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,280
to a place

200
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,600
that I've prepared for all you teachers.

201
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
It's really

202
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,600
a paradise.

203
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,000
Most importantly,

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
it hasn't been overdeveloped.

205
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
So, we can

206
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,360
take good photos there.

207
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
Great. That's good.

208
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't you think that Miss Qin

209
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
is really impressive?

210
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
It's so comfortable,

211
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,960
making me sleepy.

212
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
Take a nap.

213
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
We're about to reach.

214
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,280
Really?

215
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,960
You can take a nap.

216
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
Dad.

217
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
We're back.

218
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Come, have a seat.

219
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,720
You're studying it again.

220
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,200
So, you like chess.

221
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,120
I don't know the way.

223
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
You act as you know it.

224
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
This way.

225
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,280
Here?

226
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,120
One step further.

227
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
After struggling for half a day,

228
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,320
the situation has changed.

229
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,120
I didn't expect it, Song Lin.

230
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
You hide a light under a bushel.

231
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
I really didn't expect

232
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,640
that you're good at playing Go.

233
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,840
Not really,

234
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,160
but I learned a bit before.

235
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Not bad. Not bad.

236
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Let's play a game?

237
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,320
Sure.

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
Come, let's play.

239
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,680
You two are interesting.

240
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,800
Fang.

241
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,720
Hurry up.

242
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,360
Serve us.

243
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,440
Get us two cups of tea.

244
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,400
Hurry up.

245
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,720
Don't give your ground later.

246
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,800
Just do your best.

247
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Please treat me well.

248
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

249
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,600
I can't do that.

250
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,080
I always watch Go games on TV.

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm thinking to pick it up again.

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,040
Here we are.

253
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
It'll take time

254
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
to go hiking later.

255
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
Please don't carry too many things.

256
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,760
Okay.

257
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,400
Let's get off.

258
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,680
Okay.

259
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,640
Let's get off.

260
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,320
Miss Ru Hui,

261
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,240
you go with

262
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Ms Shen.

263
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,000
I

264
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
would like to rest in the car.

265
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
You aren't feeling well?

266
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
No. No.

267
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,400
I just think that

268
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,920
the views here

269
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
are the same.

270
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,440
It's meaningless.

271
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,440
But, just now,

272
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,200
Miss Qin said that

273
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
it'd be interesting.

274
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,120
Let's go.

275
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,960
It's fine.

276
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,560
It's alright. Ms Tian is tired.

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,440
Let's not force her.

278
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,440
Leaving her alone in the car?

279
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,360
I…I'm worried.

280
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm here. I'll accompany her.

281
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,040
Alright, Miss Ru Hui.

282
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,800
I get off

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,040
together with you

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
since we've arrived here.

285
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
It's so attractive.

286
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,440
This pond looks nice.

287
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Shall we

288
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,880
take a photo?

289
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Take a photo?

290
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,720
I don't like being photographed.

291
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,480
You can take it yourselves.

292
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,320
I tell you.

293
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
You have to get a memento

294
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,680
of your visit.

295
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,480
Yes, a memento.

296
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
Let's sit down, alright?

297
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,920
Please sit.

298
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,600
You sit down.

299
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
Come on, Ms Tian.

300
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,800
Have a seat.

301
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
I sit here as well.

302
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,080
Wait.

303
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Wait a while.

304
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,120
Something's missing.

305
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,600
So colorful.

306
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,000
I…

307
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,920
No, no, no. I… I don't need it.

308
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,600
Wear it. I'm wearing a scarf too.

309
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
It's nice.

310
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,040
Come on.

311
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,640
Come.

312
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,920
Let us know if it's ready. Come.

313
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,000
One, two, three.

314
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,160
See.

315
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Let me see. Let me see.

316
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,520
Nice, right?

317
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,600
It's really nice.

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,280
Look at your scarf, Ms Tian.

319
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,000
It matches the color of your shirt.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,760
I tell you.

321
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,840
You look younger

322
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,760
with this scarf.

323
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,320
You have a rosy glow to your face.

324
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,640
What a match.

325
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Wear it. It's picked for you.

326
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,520
So pretty.

327
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,160
Yes.

328
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,800
Check out the scenery.

329
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,560
Let me see. It's breathtaking.

330
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,440
Come, have a seat. Come.

331
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,160
Okay, let's take a photo too.

332
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,240
No need.

333
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

334
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
It's alright.

335
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,480
Let's get a memento of this visit.

336
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,280
Come.

337
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,440
Smile. Be happy.

338
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,320
One, two, three.

339
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,040
Eat something, Ms Tian.

340
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm not hungry.

341
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
You got motion sickness just now,

342
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,560
and you refuse to eat now.

343
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,800
Your body can't take it.

344
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
I'm fine.

345
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
I saw a noodle stall over there.

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,600
How about I buy it for you?

347
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
You'll feel better after having something hot.

348
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,920
No, thank you.

349
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,280
It's fine. I'll be back soon.

350
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,640
Lin.

351
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,720
Based on the opinions of

352
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
Miss Fang and you,

353
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,160
we have optimized

354
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,360
the users' profile photos

355
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
and the algorithms,

356
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
where the system

357
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,560
can get a weather forecast

358
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
at the location of the user.

359
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,440
If the weather

360
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
is detected to be colder,

361
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,680
the system will recommend the users

362
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,360
some warm clothing

363
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
for travels.

364
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,880
Moreover,

365
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,400
it can recommend some outfits

366
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
based on the users'

367
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,800
careers

368
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,840
and places to visit.

369
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
For a programmer like Xiao Fei

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
who usually works in the office

371
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,400
and has no time for shopping,

372
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
he can select

373
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,280
our one-click customization,

374
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,520
we can

375
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
recommend the outfits

376
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,480
for the whole season

377
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,560
to him.

378
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,600
Not bad.

379
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,480
The details are well designed.

380
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,680
Differentiation

381
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,520
and personalization are balanced well.

382
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,640
I think that we should

383
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,600
launch the beta version of it immediately.

384
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,720
Make a trailer

385
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
for these new features

386
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
and update it accordingly after that.

387
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,760
Sure, no problem.

388
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,760
Miss Ru Hui. Miss Ru Hui.

389
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,240
I think that

390
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,960
you should move back to here.

391
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
I wish to stay with you.

392
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960
We can

393
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
talk at least.

394
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,240
Okay?

395
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
What's wrong with you?

396
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,160
Nothing.

397
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,960
My stomach is not feeling well.

398
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
Drink a glass of hot water.

399
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,160
It helps.

400
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,880
Thank you, Ms Tian.

401
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,160
I've seen everything

402
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,560
you did for the past two days.

403
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,600
Actually, you don't have to do that.

404
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
It's meaningless and useless.

405
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,480
I hope that

406
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,000
you return

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,880
to work soon

408
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,920
and get a good rest.

409
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,680
No, Ms Tian.

410
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,720
I won't give up.

411
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,880
I'll work harder.

412
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I sleep first.

413
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,600
Sleep early.

414
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Good night.

415
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,120
Not going to your company today?

416
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,440
I'm too busy.

417
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,720
Recently,

418
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,680
I got many orders.

419
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,840
It looks like we need to recruit some new people.

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
Then, you might miss

421
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,040
the chance to be credited.

422
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,960
Am I useful to you

423
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,360
in work only?

424
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Let me think.

425
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,800
You're right.

426
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,280
Before you appeared in my life,

427
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
Luo Luo and I

428
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,560
were engaged in a battle of wits.

429
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,240
Now,

430
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,480
I think that enjoying life

431
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,760
is more important than work.

432
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Glad to hear that.

433
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,800
How are you going to reward me?

434
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,680
As you wish.

435
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,560
Great.

436
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,360
Wait for me for a while.

437
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm going to take something.

438
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Open it.

439
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,640
What day is it today?

440
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,240
I planned to give it to you

441
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,920
during the launching day.

442
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,599
However,

443
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,720
something went wrong.

444
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,160
But I think today is a good day.

445
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,480
Like it?

446
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,880
You made it?

447
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,040
Of course, I like it.

448
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,319
Why aren't they matching outfits for a couple?

449
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
You really…

450
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,920
You may have to make a concession

451
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,160
once if you accept others' conditions.

452
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,319
Dare you request for more?

453
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,120
Nice?

454
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,920
Yes.

455
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,480
I have good taste.

456
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Which one is nice?

457
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
The coat or the person?

458
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,240
Both.

459
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,720
Which one is better?

460
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,000
You.

461
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,520
I think so.

462
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,160
Thank you.

463
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:27,470
[Qin Qing]

464
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,960
Hey, Sweetheart.

465
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
You finally called me.

466
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,000
Where are you?

467
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,520
I'm at a corridor.

468
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Ms Tian has slept early.

469
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,760
I have to call you

470
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,520
secretly.

471
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,280
It must be hard for you.

472
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm fine.

473
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't think too much.

474
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,440
Coco's fine. Don't worry.

475
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,760
I'm a

476
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,640
responsible poop-picker.

477
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
I feed it every day.

478
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,240
Coco's so happy.

479
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,560
You don't forget to take allergy medicine.

480
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,280
I've taken it. Don't worry.

481
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,880
I think that

482
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm no longer allergic to Coco.

483
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,080
You still need to be cautious.

484
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,360
It's fine.

485
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,680
Sweetheart.

486
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Sorry.

487
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,440
What's wrong?

488
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,120
Why did you apologize to me?

489
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
Did my mum make things difficult

490
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,680
for you these days?

491
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,440
No.

492
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,680
That's good.

493
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,480
My mum is too stubborn.

494
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,080
You've worked hard.

495
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,960
Please come back.

496
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,720
I don't want you to be upset.

497
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,640
I don't feel

498
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
upset at all.

499
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,480
You don't think too much.

500
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,920
Everything's fine.

501
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,280
Wait for me.

502
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,120
Bye-bye.

503
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,560
Bye-bye.

504
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,240
Why does this kid

505
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
become so quiet?

506
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,080
She might be tired.

507
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,920
Be careful, Ms Li.

508
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,720
Alright. Alright.

509
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,480
This is your suitcase, Ms Tian.

510
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,360
Thank you.

511
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,000
These days, thank you.

512
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,560
I appreciate it very much,

513
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,120
no matter it's an act

514
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,760
or a real intention.

515
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,240
I'm sincere.

516
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,640
However,

517
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
it won't

518
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,320
change my mind.

519
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,360
I take

520
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,400
Lin Lin's future

521
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,040
with serious

522
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,400
care.

523
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,040
Of course.

524
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,320
It's difficult for you

525
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,560
to understand

526
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,960
a mother's feeling.

527
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
So, I hope that

528
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,840
you can stop pestering him.

529
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,280
Don't waste your time.

530
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,240
Mum.

531
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,520
Miss Ru Hui.

532
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,360
We're leaving.

533
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,520
Let's go together.

534
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,680
No, no, no. That...

535
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,600
I…I have a car.

536
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,960
We have a car…A car.

537
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,200
You leave first.

538
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
Alright, then we're leaving now.

539
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,360
Goodbye.

540
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,960
Alright. Goodbye.

541
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
Bye, aunt.

542
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,720
Let's go.

543
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,760
Bye.

544
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,400
Goodbye.

545
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,840
Mum,

546
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
how was your trip?

547
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,120
I didn't see your social media status.

548
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,080
Didn't she report to you?

549
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,320
No.

550
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,840
You really like her so much?

551
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,520
Mum, if you're tired,

552
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,640
take a nap.

553
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,080
I'm back!

554
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,040
Welcome back.

555
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
I'm back.

556
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,840
What a great job.

557
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,760
Old man.

558
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,760
You came back so early.

559
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,520
Tired?

560
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
What tired?

561
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,520
Uncle.

562
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,560
I enjoyed my life.

563
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,800
But the kid didn't.

564
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,480
No.

565
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,240
When did

566
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,000
she serve people?

567
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,800
Seriously.

568
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
How was it?

569
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,360
You couldn't even help?

570
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,440
Rome wasn't built

571
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,680
in a day.

572
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,480
No hurry.

573
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,560
It...

574
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,040
There is a long time ahead.

575
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,080
I'll figure it out to help you.

576
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
Sure. Please rest well.

577
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,560
Drink water. I cook for you.

578
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,840
Thank you, Uncle.

579
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
Do you want some water?

580
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,840
Let me do it.

581
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,000
I knew it.

582
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,760
Feel wronged?

583
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,680
Want to cry?

584
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
Let's go to my bedroom.

585
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,160
No.

586
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,320
I asked for it.

587
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,280
I feel sorry to Aunt.

588
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
What hard work these two days.

589
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
What was so hard?

590
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm fine.

591
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,440
No.

592
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,600
You wanted to

593
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,560
create opportunities for us

594
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,360
without being discovered

595
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,280
and suspected.

596
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,360
Racking your brain all day

597
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,160
like a spy movie.

598
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,840
That's too much.

599
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,640
Alright. Let's think

600
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
what to do next time.

601
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,640
Next time?

602
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,800
Based on her

603
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,640
attitude toward me,

604
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
I think nothing else can be done.

605
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,160
How can it be?

606
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,080
We must figure out a way.

607
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Wu San told me that his mum

608
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
can be begged only.

609
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,120
You've

610
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,000
showed your intention.

611
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,120
But she wasn't convinced.

612
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,600
It looks like

613
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,720
your ways don't work.

614
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,840
Think of another way.

615
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,720
Be optimistic.

616
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,901
[Tian Li Juan]

617
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,120
Ms Tian.

618
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
Hey, Tian.

619
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,520
Have you reached home, Miss Ru Hui?

620
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,640
Yes. Yes.

621
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
Great.

622
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,560
Since you didn't allow
me to send you off,

623
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,600
then I have to call you.

624
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,680
Two days later,

625
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,000
I wish to treat you a meal, Miss Ru Hui.

626
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,720
Are you okay?

627
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,640
Sure.

628
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,880
Great.

629
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,840
Alright.

630
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,600
I'll leave you to rest then.

631
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,720
Rest well.

632
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,760
Alright, sure.

633
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
Rest early too.

634
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,120
Alright.

635
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,960
Bye-bye.

636
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
It's unexpected that Ms Tian

637
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
quite likes you.

638
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,600
Only you don't like me.

639
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
Others like me so much.

640
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,640
Qing. See.

641
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,080
It's another chance.

642
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,280
Don't worry.

643
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,800
I'll figure out a way.

644
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
No worries. My mum

645
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,160
can settle it.

646
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,249
[Wu San]

647
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,720
Hey.

648
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,840
You are angry?

649
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,760
Why am I angry?

650
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,680
Leave you alone outside.

651
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,840
Sorry.

652
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,280
You didn't want it.

653
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
You got no choice either.

654
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,880
Have you eaten?

655
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,800
Yes.

656
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,360
Don't forget to eat on time

657
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,680
without me by your side.

658
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,960
If not, you'll get gastritis.

659
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,920
Got it.

660
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,240
Still working?

661
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,080
Actually, I can go home.

662
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,520
But,

663
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,600
I won't be able to call you

664
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,360
once I'm at home.

665
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,160
Did your mum say anything

666
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,040
after returning home?

667
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,480
She didn't say anything.

668
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,320
She said

669
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,840
how good Aunt Li was.

670
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,440
She did it purposely.

671
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,280
Both of them

672
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,840
are quite good to each other.

673
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh, right.

674
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,720
My mum called me again.

675
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
What did she say?

676
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,280
What else would she say?

677
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,320
She asked

678
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,200
why we hadn't gone back

679
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
and eaten with them.

680
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,320
I told her that you have been busy.

681
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,600
Once you have time,

682
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,520
we can go back.

683
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,600
I plan to

684
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,120
go back tomorrow.

685
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,800
If not, they'll be worried.

686
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,200
That's good.

687
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
Sorry, Sweetheart.

688
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,440
You need to

689
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,800
face all these.

690
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,240
Don't mention it.

691
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,600
Please help me think of a way.

692
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
Does your mum have any weakness?

693
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Weakness?

694
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,640
I think that I'm

695
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,280
my mum's biggest weakness.

696
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
Do you think that

697
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
we should elope?

698
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,920
Actually,

699
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,760
there's no problem

700
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,880
with our company system.

701
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
I

702
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,960
delayed the launch,

703
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,000
so that we could

704
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,840
optimize

705
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,040
the software

706
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,480
to give a better user experience

707
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,520
to our users.

708
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,440
Regarding our competitors,

709
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
to be honest,

710
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,960
I don't have any competitor

711
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,680
in this aspect.

712
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,280
We will look forward to it.

713
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,480
Hopefully, you can create

714
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,360
a new achievement.

715
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,120
Thank you.

716
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,320
President Su.

717
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
How are the data statistics?

718
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,480
Up to now,

719
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,400
the user satisfaction rate

720
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
has achieved 95%.

721
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,320
Now,

722
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
our view rates

723
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,360
are much higher than Song Lin's.

724
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,800
Don't worry.

725
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,280
Did you know

726
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
Song Lin's software?

727
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,800
No.

728
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,960
I suggest you should take a look.

729
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,800
Its new feature

730
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,600
is quite interesting.

731
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,120
President Su. Didn't you say that

732
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,000
the superfluous

733
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,560
details

734
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
are pretty useless,

735
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
and asked us not to

736
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,840
waste time doing it?

737
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,680
Song Lin saw it.

738
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,280
Since he couldn't get the best launching time,

739
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,280
he is using another method.

740
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,640
Ask the marketing team

741
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,680
to promote harder.

742
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
I'd like to see how long he can sustain.

743
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,000
President Su.

744
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,640
Anything else?

745
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,400
These two days,

746
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,320
hackers attempted to bypass the firewall.

747
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
The technical team

748
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,200
has been solving it, right?

749
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,880
Watch the timing.

750
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't affect the operation.

751
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Got it.

752
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,960
Go.

753
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,120
Hello.

754
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,040
What's wrong? So anxious?

755
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
Nothing actually.

756
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,240
New leather coat.

757
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,600
Let me guess.

758
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,960
It was given by Miss Zhou,

759
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,480
right?

760
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,720
That's right.

761
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,000
It looks great.

762
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Isn't it good?

763
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,080
Not bad. Not bad.

764
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,280
Not bad, right?

765
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,920
Not bad.

766
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,880
Don't tell me that

767
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
you asked me

768
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,280
to come here from far,

769
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,160
so that you could

770
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,120
show off your new leather coat?

771
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,760
Not really.

772
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,040
I want to discuss work with you.

773
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
I want to ask you

774
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,720
the progress of the project.

775
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,280
Regarding the project,

776
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,560
I've tried to contact

777
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,320
a few websites

778
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,640
and mainstream media.

779
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,360
However, it wasn't an easy task.

780
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,360
That's natural, right?

781
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
I'm not interested

782
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,960
in easy things,

783
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,760
right?

784
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,600
Su Yu Shan and I have been competing

785
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,400
for resources for years.

786
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,320
I'm used to it.

787
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,160
I mean,

788
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,360
I have some ideas

789
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,720
for the websites.

790
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
If we can negotiate

791
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,120
and collaborate,

792
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,920
there will be a chance.

793
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,440
I'll do my best.

794
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,240
I heard that you are making

795
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,800
a new show,

796
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,240
right?

797
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
You know the time of day, President Song.

798
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Besides the sponsorship,

799
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
help me check out

800
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,920
if there's any way to collaborate.

801
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,400
I've signed

802
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
a few niche brands.

803
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
I want to include them

804
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,560
to promote

805
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,120
their popularity.

806
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,080
Will I not do it

807
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,120
if you ask me to do so?

808
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Deal, right?

809
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,880
Why do you

810
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,840
wear this today?

811
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
A rider?

812
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,840
How's it? A classic English style.

813
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Let me

814
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,240
take you for a ride?

815
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,280
Let's go.

816
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,720
Mine is a classic style too.

817
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,560
Okay.

818
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,680
Don't show off

819
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,440
in front of me.

820
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,120
Let's go.

821
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,840
I tell you.

822
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,320
You must

823
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,440
take action soon.

824
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
It's useless

825
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
to look at

826
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,520
Lu Na's Weibo forever.

827
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,960
Mind your own business.

828
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,040
Who did say that

829
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
I could only follow you on Weibo?

830
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,440
E-commerce is growing

831
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,600
at an unprecedented rate.

832
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,560
However, since President Ling has been in

833
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,280
the industry of investment for years,

834
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,120
you should be aware of

835
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
the good relationship

836
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,280
between President Su and me.

837
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,040
President Mo.

838
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,360
You've been in the business industry for years.

839
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,880
You know that

840
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
an investment

841
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,360
shouldn't be made

842
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,240
based on the connection, right?

843
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,680
Yes.

844
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240
You're right.

845
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,320
However,

846
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
based on the

847
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
current market trend,

848
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,680
Chuang Pin Net

849
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,520
has the most users.

850
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,800
That is the fact, right?

851
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,520
Alright.

852
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,320
You try to look for

853
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
another investor.

854
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,280
I don't consider

855
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
the second round of financing.

856
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm leaving first.

857
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,080
Please wait, President Mo.

858
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,200
If you have a chance,

859
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,320
please try our software.

860
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,800
The most important element

861
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,040
of a software

862
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,120
is the user experience.

863
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,160
It's not about the number of users.

864
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,000
Sure, I'll check it out if I have a chance.

865
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,760
He's right.

866
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,680
Our launch

867
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,080
was not as good as expected.

868
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,840
President Mo

869
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,760
wishes to give up.

870
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
It's expected that

871
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,920
he wouldn't be interested

872
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,320
in the second round of financing.

873
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,560
Alright.

874
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,480
We shouldn't

875
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,640
give up now.

876
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,560
Cheer up

877
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,760
and continue our development.

878
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's go.

879
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,040
Alright. I'll find

880
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,600
a new investor.

881
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,920
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

882
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,080
Bye-bye.

883
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,480
Wu San.

884
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,440
Miss Fang?

885
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Why are you here?

886
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm here to look for Song Lin.

887
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,040
Lin and President Ling

888
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
have left the office for a discussion.

889
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,280
I wanted to

890
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,880
surprise him,

891
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,360
so I didn't notify him.

892
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,000
How's the company doing?

893
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,800
Is everything okay?

894
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,280
So far,

895
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,760
the registration rate and feedback of users

896
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,160
haven't been as good as expected.

897
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,360
These two days, Lin has been busy

898
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,280
expanding the brand

899
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,960
while

900
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,640
getting resources for publicity.

901
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,400
He's quite stressful.

902
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,040
It must have cost a lot.

903
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,720
If we don't

904
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,120
turn the tide,

905
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,080
our next financing will surely be affected.

906
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
Actually, the development of this software

907
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,320
isn't easy.

908
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,639
Besides

909
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,120
the short-term

910
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,800
budget,

911
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,639
signing new brands

912
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,600
and designers

913
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,840
are costly.

914
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,719
However,

915
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,600
in the long run,

916
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,000
they are essential

917
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,080
to promote users' retention.

918
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,920
We're lacking

919
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,320
designers like you.

920
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Don't worry.

921
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,560
Once our new feature

922
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
launches,

923
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,639
it'll get better.

924
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Although our

925
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,760
daily active users are less than Bai Sai's,

926
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,000
our user duration

927
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,880
is not too bad.

928
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,000
That's great.

929
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,440
I'll leave it

930
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,040
to you.

931
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm leaving.

932
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,199
I'll send you off.

933
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,639
It's fine. You carry on.

934
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:45,209
[Lin Fang Technology]

935
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,760
Did she go and meet you?

936
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,000
It's as I expected.

937
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,440
To be frank,

938
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,680
regarding the virtual fitting of

939
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,160
Chuang Pin Net,

940
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,440
both the

941
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,160
realism and user experience

942
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,280
underperform.

943
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,840
I know it.

944
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,640
That's why we have improved.

945
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,560
Our designer

946
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,600
of this part

947
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,920
is quite excellent.

948
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,120
Her

949
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,320
TKY experience store

950
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,800
is our main project now.

951
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,000
If you're interested,

952
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
you can visit it.

953
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,920
Sure.

954
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,040
I'd like to experience it.

955
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,560
Let's drink coffee.

956
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,920
Here, please.

957
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,640
President Mo is here, Miss Fang.

958
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,200
Hello, President Mo.

959
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,240
Hello, I'm Zhou Fang.

960
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,560
Hello, President Fang.

961
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,920
Hello. Have a sit. Come.

962
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,440
I'm sorry

963
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,160
to ask you

964
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,240
to come here from far.

965
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,360
It's fine.

966
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
But do you know

967
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,320
the relationship between President Su and me?

968
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,640
Yes.

969
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,960
Great. Then, I'll be straight forward.

970
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,120
President Su has

971
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,640
an application of the virtual fitting.

972
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,000
I think that,

973
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,280
both the

974
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,880
realism and user experience

975
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,040
underperform.

976
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,000
However, I heard that

977
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,240
your recommendation

978
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,960
would be different.

979
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,640
So I'm here to experience it.

980
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,160
Alright.

981
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,760
Since President Mo is interested,

982
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,040
I'll show you around.

983
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Here, please.

984
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
Come. Let's go.

985
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,600
Your coffee.

986
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,240
Please enjoy it.

987
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,960
Thank you.

988
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,560
I'm surprised

989
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,800
to see you today, President Mo.

990
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,240
These few days,

991
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,400
I've investigated

992
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,560
your software.

993
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,320
I realized

994
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,760
its ability in the market.

995
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,640
Based on the latest market feedback,

996
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,400
the users

997
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,480
who use our application

998
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,000
have better user experience

999
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,520
than Chuang Pin Net's.

1000
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,280
Moreover,

1001
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,760
we are discussing with a few designers

1002
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
to develop

1003
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,160
the team of designers,

1004
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,080
so that our customers

1005
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,560
could have more choices.

1006
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,920
Great.

1007
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,720
The user experience

1008
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
normally relies on details.

1009
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
I've been in the investment industry for years.

1010
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,040
I still manage to get it.

1011
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,160
Are you going

1012
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,440
for the second round of financing?

1013
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
Let's talk about it today.

1014
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,800
Sure.

1015
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,240
Zhou Fang.

1016
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Why are you here?

1017
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,560
I'm here without informing you.

1018
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
I hope that you don't mind.

1019
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,440
How are you? Busy?

1020
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,720
Let me treat you a meal.

1021
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,240
Sure.

1022
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,840
So,

1023
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,640
President Mo has agreed on

1024
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,000
your second round of financing?

1025
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,960
Yes, I just simply asked.

1026
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,880
I asked him

1027
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,200
the reason he downloaded

1028
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,240
our application.

1029
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,360
He said that it was because of you.

1030
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
So, thank you.

1031
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,200
Actually, I just made

1032
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
President Mo

1033
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,240
experience the APP indirectly.

1034
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,120
It's Song Lin's and your effort,

1035
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,200
as well as the team's hard work

1036
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,560
to get the outcome.

1037
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,840
Of course.

1038
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,320
I don't deny that.

1039
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
Actually,

1040
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm jealous of you.

1041
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,440
Jealous of me?

1042
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Since you're jealous of me,

1043
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,400
I'll be frank to you.

1044
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,840
Before this,

1045
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,640
I'm quite sensitive to your presence.

1046
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,360
Because I couldn't help

1047
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,440
my boyfriend

1048
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
when he was down.

1049
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,600
You were the one

1050
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,520
who accompanied him.

1051
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm just his working partner.

1052
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,000
I do what I'm supposed to.

1053
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,360
However, I really didn't expect that

1054
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,280
you could still

1055
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,680
stay with him

1056
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,480
and develop together,

1057
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,800
even though both of you

1058
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,840
have different stands in different fields.

1059
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,560
Cheer for you two.

1060
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,400
Cheer for our careers.

1061
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,760
Cheer for

1062
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,400
your investment too.

1063
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
I accept

1064
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,040
your compliment sincerely.

1065
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,280
If one day,

1066
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
our product

1067
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
had caused problems to your career,

1068
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,560
what would you do?

1069
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,160
I believe that

1070
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,880
I could overcome

1071
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
all problems.

1072
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Thank you so much

1073
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,280
for the case of President Mo this time.

1074
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,320
You've thanked me.

1075
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,840
You got off work so early today.

1076
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,080
It's unusual.

1077
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,560
President Zhou.

1078
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,760
President Zhou

1079
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,840
doesn't need a relationship?

1080
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,560
Are we dating?

1081
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,560
Of course.

1082
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,040
Enjoy the scenery

1083
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,280
in the rain.

1084
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,520
Isn't it a date?

1085
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,160
I'm recharged only

1086
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,400
when I see you.

1087
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,480
Zhou Fang.

1088
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,800
You're so attractive.

1089
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,400
You just realized it?

1090
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,920
I'm always attractive.

1091
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm coming.

1092
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,840
Please wait.

1093
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,120
I'm coming.

1094
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,160
Hello.

1095
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,200
I'm the property manager of this community.

1096
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,800
I want to inform you that,

1097
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,520
the coming Sunday

1098
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,360
and Saturday,

1099
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,640
there will be workers here

1100
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,480
to change the smoke detectors.

1101
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,720
Please

1102
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,640
leave someone at home.

1103
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,680
Sure, thank you.

1104
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,160
Bye-bye.
