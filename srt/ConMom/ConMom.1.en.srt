1
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Berbania is a peaceful and happy kingdom.</i>

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,730
Ruling over it is King Fernando,

3
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,484
and the queen is Queen Valeriana.

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,277
They have three children.

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,113
The eldest is Prince Pedro,

6
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,783
the second is Prince Diego,

7
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,577
and the youngest is Prince Juan.

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:30,548
One day, King Fernando
became severely ill.

9
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,469
The whole of Berbania
was drained of its spirit.

10
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:38,765
Your Highness, we did everything we could

11
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,519
but we were unable to cure you.

12
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,440
Only the song of the Ibong Adarna
can heal him.

13
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,320
You can find the Ibong Adarna
on Mount Tabor.

14
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,033
Prince Juan left hurriedly.

15
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,828
This mountain is so steep.

16
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,331
It was midnight when
the Ibong Adarna started singing.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,750
It's Mommy!

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,266
He was amazed by its enchanting voice.

19
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,352
Before he could fall asleep,

20
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,356
he wounded his arm
and doused it with lime.

21
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,233
His sleepiness left him

22
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,154
and he caught the Ibong Adarna.

23
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,166
I'm healed.

24
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,293
My illness is gone.

25
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,337
Thank you, Ibong Adarna.

26
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,134
Thank you my son, Prince Juan.

27
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,421
You were amazing, Mom!

28
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,716
When I grow up, I want to be like you.

29
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,510
- Really?
- You want to be a bird too?

30
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,554
Stop it, Uncle Benok!

31
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,183
I want to be an actress like Mom.

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,893
She's truly amazing!

33
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,436
That's so sweet.

34
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,772
So, only your mom is amazing?

35
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,399
- You too, Uncle!
- There!

36
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,945
- Is that so? Only they are great?
- Wait. Hold on!

37
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,029
Is that so?

38
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,324
Of course, you're amazing too,
Uncle Jetboy.

39
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,830
Your mom and I are amazing
because we're meant for each other.

40
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,877
Stop your delusion with Pinky.
She's already a mom.

41
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:17,298
Can't you take a joke, Benok?
I was just kidding.

42
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,759
All of you are the best!

43
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,263
You, my godfathers, and Nanny Brittany.

44
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,891
But Mommy is the best of the best!

45
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,393
Wow!

46
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,311
You know why I'm the best?

47
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,733
But, Mommy,

48
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,153
what Prince Juan did seems painful,

49
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:44,117
when he wounded his arm
and he even dripped lime on it.

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,994
Here's the thing…

51
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,498
Sometimes, when you really love someone,

52
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:55,378
you will make any sacrifice
for that person.

53
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,964
Prince Juan made that sacrifice

54
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:02,677
to catch the Ibong Adarna
and heal his father. Right?

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,140
Mom, when you get sick, I'll do that too.

56
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,601
I will find and catch
the Ibong Adarna for you.

57
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,939
You'll also squeeze lime on your wound?
Will you do that?

58
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,067
- Promise?
- Promise.

59
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,527
I'll do it for you too.

60
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,866
You know, I'll do anything for you.
Even squeeze lime on a wound.

61
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,576
Even one kilo of lime.

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,162
- Okay?
- Squeeze it on your eyes?

63
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,872
Just on the arm.

64
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,956
Stop laughing!

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,127
You two, why don't you
let the kid play on the swing?

66
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,421
- Yeah!
- Come here.

67
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,138
Hi, Ma'am Pinky.

68
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,098
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

69
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,693
You might be late. Let's hurry!

70
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,164
- Perfect!
- Stop it, Mommy!

71
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,626
Okay, go inside now. You might be late.
Give Mommy a kiss.

72
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,683
Pinky,

73
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,603
thank you for yesterday.

74
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,981
We didn't expect Joy to get sick.

75
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,733
You're welcome.

76
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,946
I got a little nervous.

77
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,908
You didn't tell me in advance
that I'd be the songbird.

78
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,202
My vocal cords weren't ready.

79
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,915
You did great.
You've been great since high school.

80
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,544
If I were you…

81
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,338
I'm sure you missed it, right?

82
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,095
- She'll make a comeback!
- She'll make a comeback!

83
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,596
Stop it!

84
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,098
Anton won't let me.

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,309
It's time to come back.

86
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,938
You've done what your husband wanted.
Yana is grown now.

87
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,900
She can handle herself,
she's independent and intelligent.

88
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,403
You've no reason
not to pursue your passion again.

89
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,197
We'll end up fighting
about this endlessly.

90
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,490
Then just argue about it.

91
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,535
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't want that. I'm okay with this.

92
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,247
I get to spend time with you.
I get to have gigs from time to time.

93
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,251
You know, you might end up
ruining their relationship.

94
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,463
You're a real kiss-up.
Just be a supportive friend.

95
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:48,050
Supportive? I'm supportive of them.
I don't want them to fight.

96
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,511
For your information, Benok,

97
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,763
if it weren't for Anton,

98
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,683
we won't be here,
eating at this exclusive clubhouse.

99
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,478
You can't eat that,
even if it's already making you choke.

100
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,188
Whatever.

101
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,982
You guys talk a lot. I'll just eat now.

102
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,447
I need to pee. Let's go to the restroom.

103
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,615
You'll pee together?

104
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,325
- Yes, you go too.
- Let's go.

105
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,743
- Why do I have to?
- No reason.

106
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,621
Come on, let's go!

107
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,122
- You should come.
- Let's go now.

108
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,625
I don't need to go. I'll just stay--

109
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,127
Come with us, we'll help you pee.

110
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,505
- I can go on my own.
- No!

111
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,012
Anton?

112
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,180
Why?

113
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,474
Baby?

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,186
Anton? Baby?

115
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,395
It's Pinky.

116
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,545
When were you going to tell me?

117
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,520
Love…

118
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,856
are we really fighting over this?

119
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,525
Really, Anton?

120
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,071
It keeps happening. Now she's pregnant.

121
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,784
Why did you even marry me?

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,876
You'll just overreact again.

123
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,047
Overreact? You knocked her up.
How do you expect me to just calm down?

124
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,633
Is it wrong that I'm hurting?

125
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,847
This is how you always are.
It's your fault, but you're mad at me.

126
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,652
I don't want this anymore.

127
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,698
- I'm tired.
- Then leave!

128
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,119
You're tired, right?

129
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,118
Pinky.

130
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,538
Don't leave.

131
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,085
Your son asked me to leave.

132
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,298
You know Anton is short-tempered.

133
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,009
Just give him time to calm down.

134
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,638
Ma, he keeps cheating on me.

135
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,071
If you have to put up with it,

136
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,032
you'll do it.

137
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,093
I don't know how you did it.

138
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,064
Pinky.

139
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:33,043
Yana won't submit her project
because she wants to show you first.

140
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,337
- Thank you, ma'am.
- All right.

141
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,768
- Are you done with work?
- Yes.

142
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,658
Where are you going?

143
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,963
- Kits, can you get her things?
- Okay, sir.

144
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,660
I'll call you.

145
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,664
Come back quickly, okay?

146
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,651
Hey, Maloi!

147
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,653
- Come here!
- I'm coming.

148
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,200
- Hurry, Maloi!
- Yes, I'm right here.

149
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,536
Hurry!

150
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,601
Look at his face.

151
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,768
Cut it out.

152
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,195
Why are you mocking her?
She has a problem.

153
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,073
That's why she rejected you before.

154
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,825
It's me again?

155
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,994
I'll be right back.

156
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:39,313
Go ahead and sleep now.
You have an early class tomorrow.

157
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,914
- Sweet dreams!
<i>- Bye, Mommy!</i>

158
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,966
I can't do this.

159
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,660
You should have just brought Yana here.

160
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,999
She was stopped at school, right?

161
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,043
He even brought all her things there.

162
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,424
Maybe I shouldn't have left.

163
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,845
What are you saying?

164
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,099
Your husband knocked up someone else.

165
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,769
He keeps cheating on you.
You have every reason to leave him.

166
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,316
Maybe I should've just listened to Mama.

167
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,278
I guess I should have been patient.

168
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,535
I'll go home now.

169
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,287
What?

170
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,206
No!

171
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,419
Your husband is a manipulator.

172
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,255
A womanizer, an abuser.

173
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,969
It's a good thing you were able to escape.
Being separated isn't a bad thing.

174
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,263
Right.

175
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,269
Sorry, I can't handle this.

176
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,022
I'll just go back home.

177
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,990
Where's Elvis?

178
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,493
Elvis!

179
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,374
I'm sorry, Ms. Pinky.

180
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,501
I can't let you in.

181
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,837
- It's an order from Sir Anton.
- Elvis, please let me in.

182
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,381
I really can't allow you to enter.

183
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,841
That's all right.

184
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,176
- Really, no!
- Elvis!

185
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,472
This will be just between us.

186
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,017
If you let us in, I'll get you some guys.

187
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,936
Guys?

188
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,773
What do you think I am? Gay?

189
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,776
You're not gay? But you know gay lingo?
Stop fooling me!

190
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,319
I'm not gay!

191
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,365
Okay, you don't want guys?
I'll get you girls, pretty ones.

192
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,243
- You know I'm loyal to my wife.
- Elvis!

193
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:45,666
But, Ms. Pinky,
I'm not trying to boss you around.

194
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,378
Why don't you call Mr. Anton?

195
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,797
- I'm just following orders.
- Just call him.

196
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,510
That's what you must do, Ms. Pinky.

197
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,761
Elvis!

198
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,180
So, how many are they?

199
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,766
- See? He's gay!
- No, I'm just curious.

200
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,104
Ma'am?

201
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,983
See? Your boss is so rude, Elvis!

202
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,819
You're too quick to judge.

203
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,945
I'm really sorry.

204
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,698
- Let's go.
- I'm really sorry, ma'am.

205
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,907
You're useless, Elvis!

206
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,117
Elvis!

207
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,077
Elvis!

208
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,203
That's already a lot.

209
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,122
- Elvis!
- Hey!

210
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,290
You're gay!

211
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,543
No one's gay here. Who's gay?

212
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,067
- You're here early.
- Right.

213
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:00,699
The Internet here is better than at home.

214
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,871
Sorry about the Internet at the house.

215
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,498
I'm trying to look for a job.

216
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,380
Wow, that's so cute! I think I want that.

217
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,467
Hey! Trying to be cute doesn't suit you.

218
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,010
Why attack me again?

219
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:26,558
Why don't you give me a job here?
Or in your plays?

220
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,771
You can handle the sponsorships
for our street plays.

221
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,939
I told you, right?

222
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,441
I don't think I can handle it.

223
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,152
You can do it. Even Maloi can do it.

224
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,531
You're rude.
I'm worried I might not be capable.

225
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,409
I last worked when I was a student.

226
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,167
Are you set on ending things with Anton?

227
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,045
Such bad timing. We're at work.

228
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,297
He's right. Why bring it up now?

229
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,507
Here's the thing…

230
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,636
Once Anton and Pinky split up,
I can start pursuing Pinky.

231
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,142
Keep it down.
This only between the three of us.

232
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,689
He didn't hear us.

233
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,274
Only the three of us know.

234
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,693
- Enough with the nonsense!
- Yeah, cut it out.

235
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,280
I've had it in mind for a while,
and now I've finally done it.

236
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,033
Exactly, you've taken the first step.
You got out of it.

237
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,035
- Yes.
- Now you're looking for a job.

238
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,330
Eventually, you'll be able
to support yourself.

239
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,084
I hope so.

240
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,962
The hardest thing

241
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,548
is being away from my child.

242
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,348
Get custody of Yana…

243
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,019
because as her mother, you have the right.

244
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,895
Don't worry.

245
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,273
I'll be her father figure.

246
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,862
Ouch!

247
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,658
- What's wrong?
- You have the guts to suggest that, huh?

248
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,995
I've been thinking about that,
don't worry.

249
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:14,082
What's important is
I still get to spend time with Yana.

250
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,168
- I've been planning that.
- Right.

251
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,338
If you don't want me
to stand as her father,

252
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,341
then…

253
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,718
I will sit as her father.

254
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,763
Stop before I poke your eyes
with a toothpick.

255
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,390
- What toothpaste?
- Toothpick!

256
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,144
I misheard.

257
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:38,023
How can you be a father
when you can't even listen properly.

258
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,213
Yana!

259
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,215
Mommy!

260
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,517
Is your vacation over?
Are you coming home now?

261
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,858
I won't really be gone.

262
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,820
I'll still be around,
but I need to work, okay?

263
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,031
You're also gonna work?

264
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,243
You'll also be busy like Dad?

265
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,884
and I'll call you every night. I promise.

266
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,846
Look.

267
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,154
Wow!

268
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,156
Here you go.

269
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,715
You might be late.

270
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,091
- Bye, Mommy!
- Wait!

271
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,552
I'll take her to the classroom.

272
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,471
Mommy, come home soon.

273
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,482
Yana, what snacks
do you want for tomorrow?

274
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,235
I'll ask Velma to prepare them.

275
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,823
No need, Grandma.
Mommy will prepare my snacks.

276
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,287
But your mom isn't here.

277
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,166
She visited me at school earlier.

278
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,841
Yana, your mom visits you at school?

279
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,218
Yes, Daddy!

280
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:15,263
And she promised
to bring me snacks every day.

281
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,735
Yana, here.

282
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,333
Yana.

283
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,132
You want me to sleep beside you?

284
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,094
Okay, Grandma.

285
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,473
But, Grandma, have you seen my tablet?

286
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,184
Your tablet?

287
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,524
I think it's broken.
Dad will get it fixed.

288
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,783
Sorry, it's out of battery.

289
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,460
It ran out of battery too.

290
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,424
How can I say good night to Mommy?

291
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,324
Hello? Ms. Pinky?

292
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,035
<i>Brittany, Yana is not answering my calls.</i>

293
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,998
Ma'am, Sir Anton took her tablet.

294
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,087
Okay, can I talk to her now?

295
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,799
Ma'am, she's not allowed,
according to Sir Anton.

296
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,010
I'll just say a quick good night.

297
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,055
<i>But Ms. Ingrid is in her room.</i>

298
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,061
All right.

299
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,071
They took her tablet.

300
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,158
They're really annoying.

301
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,368
My goodness!

302
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,421
Why?

303
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,801
Mrs. Gonzales, I'm sorry.
I might lose my job if I let you in.

304
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,721
But why? I just want
to give my daughter her snacks.

305
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,557
We were told not to allow you inside.

306
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,518
Who told you that?

307
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,772
Ma'am, it's just an order
that I must follow.

308
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,820
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

309
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,076
Darn it!

310
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,413
What now?
Your husband banned you from here too?

311
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,249
He took advantage
of being a board member here.

312
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,460
The guard said he's just following orders.

313
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,797
How about you?
You can't see your daughter?

314
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,760
Your husband and his mother are heartless!

315
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,429
Jetboy, why don't you try?

316
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,352
Pinky-loo!

317
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,897
I have an idea.

318
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,453
- Any problem?
- Nothing. This is just a checkpoint.

319
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,005
Ms. Pinky?

320
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,382
Mommy! Uncles!

321
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,554
Can you open the door please?

322
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,015
Please let me hug her.

323
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,308
I'll go outside.

324
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,894
Ma'am, I might get in trouble.

325
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:35,023
Trouble? I'm sure your boss
won't forbid the child to talk to guards.

326
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,941
What are you talking about, Uncle?

327
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,407
I brought something for you.

328
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,328
Nanny Brittany, let's go outside.

329
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,458
Brittany, please?

330
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,674
You connect the dots.

331
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,469
- Wow!
- She's brighter than you.

332
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,269
Okay, next.

333
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,565
Hello, Ms. Ingrid.

334
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,735
Yes?

335
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:49,639
Max, I'm sorry. Brittany texted me
that they're with Anton.

336
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,723
Abort mission.

337
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,268
That's okay, ma'am.
We're here daily anyway,

338
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,854
except Sundays, since it's family day.

339
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,355
Okay.

340
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,816
Wow, I hope everyone has family days.

341
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,361
Yes, we'll have a family day.
See you on Sunday, okay?

342
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,737
We'll have a family day.

343
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,364
Are you crazy?

344
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,866
What if you get caught?

345
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,325
So over-the-top.

346
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,995
So what if we get caught?
Yana is her child.

347
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,415
That smells of trouble, Benok Jr.

348
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,041
You're such warfreaks!

349
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,127
Hey, don't call me Benok Jr.

350
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:26,968
Why are you here?
You didn't even tell us you're coming.

351
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,430
- Aren't you directing something in Manila?
- Yeah.

352
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,473
Do you want me for your movie?

353
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,561
Jetboy called me.
He said you need reinforcements.

354
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,732
Why won't I call your cousin?
Pinky has a big problem.

355
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,192
She can't go near her daughter.

356
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,404
Until when will you wear disguises
just to see her? It's unfair!

357
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:52,619
If I have to do it, I will.
Just so I can be with her. Why wouldn't I?

358
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,912
Are you crazy?

359
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,709
We want you to go back
to theater acting, but not this.

360
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,127
This is extreme.

361
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,089
We should get your daughter back.
That's what we need a plan for.

362
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,341
Okay, I'll get a lawyer.

363
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,345
Then, I'll pay an acceptance fee,
appearance fee, so many fees.

364
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,888
Where will I get the money?

365
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,682
So, you'll just suffer?

366
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,810
If it's for Yana, why not?

367
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,481
Won't you guys help me? For Yana.

368
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,901
Answer me!

369
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,069
Jelly?

370
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,199
Wait, we can't use that.

371
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,867
That's okay.

372
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,161
He will be unrecognizable.

373
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,999
Are you sure Yana will be here?

374
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,711
We're so sure!
They come here every Friday.

375
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,172
You really know their schedule, huh?

376
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,841
How come you don't know?
Are you really her friend?

377
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,760
Here they are!

378
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,928
They're here.

379
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,768
- Anything you like? Sure.
- Can I go there?

380
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,311
Brittany, accompany her.

381
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,396
Okay, ma'am.

382
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,941
- I want this.
- Auntie, you're here too.

383
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,777
Hi, Aunty Ingrid! How are you?

384
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,737
Jetboy, Benok, how's Pinky?

385
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:15,618
She's all right. But sad, of course.
It's your fault because you're evil.

386
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,745
You like that? Tell your grandma.

387
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,539
Do you want that toy?

388
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,752
You like it?

389
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,964
But it's all right.

390
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,549
Here, look at this.

391
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,229
I'll show this to Grandma.

392
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,773
Look at this star. And here's it's butt.

393
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,400
Don't show her.

394
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,910
Yes, meaning whoever keeps
the secret the longest wins.

395
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,705
No one has to know
we're seeing each other, okay?

396
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,499
- I can't tell Dad?
- Yes, you can't tell him.

397
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,419
- Is Nanny Brittany part of the game?
- Yes, she's joining.

398
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,212
She'll keep the secret too.

399
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,923
No has to know
we're seeing each other. Promise?

400
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,886
Can we buy this already?

401
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,567
- Just one.
- Okay, ma'am.

402
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,570
Just a reminder,
you have a meeting tomorrow.

403
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,614
- She's coming!
- To us?

404
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,580
Wait, we might get caught.

405
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,416
Remember our secret game, okay?

406
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,709
- Okay.
- Hold on.

407
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,719
Wait, take this.

408
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,058
Okay, go back now.

409
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,102
- Here's the payment.
- No need for that.

410
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,813
- This is a secret, okay?
- Go back now!

411
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,027
Are they gone?

412
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,124
Nanny, I think this is good.

413
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,502
You want to try this?

414
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,467
- You want this?
- Dear.

415
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,429
Dear, is that good?

416
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,228
Uncle Benok?

417
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,275
Uncle Jetboy?

418
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,287
- Beach?
- What beach?

419
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,289
Guys, she's coming!

420
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,269
Crazy! What's that?

421
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,980
I got a reply!
They want to sponsor our play.

422
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,357
They set a meeting with us.

423
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,902
Wow!

424
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,280
You already got three sponsors.
I told you, you could do it.

425
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,406
Idol!

426
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:45,161
She can juggle both her job
and our gimmicks to help her see Yana.

427
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,331
In fairness, she can also
still attend online classes.

428
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,666
That's why I'm your crush.

429
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,130
Annoying!

430
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,315
Sorry, I'm late.

431
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,080
Thank you for understanding.

432
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,831
I'll show you her picture.

433
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,585
I'll show her to you.

434
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,545
Here.

435
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,303
You know, you should enjoy every moment.

436
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,181
They grow up too quickly.

437
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,646
I became too busy with work.

438
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,398
If I could only turn back time…

439
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,493
Hold on.

440
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
Here it is.

441
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,960
We read what you sent us,
and everything's clear.

442
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,685
Really?

443
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,276
Thank you so much!

444
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,447
I'm sure the Lord
will bless your business more.

445
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,993
Actually, it's just her business.
I work at the airport.

446
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,748
Really? I'm sure God
will also bless your work.

447
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,250
Thank you.

448
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,252
Thank you so much.

449
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,463
Honey, you want to order?

450
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,424
You must be hungry.

451
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,051
Order something.

452
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,720
Really? Okay.

453
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,385
They're here.

454
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,307
The nerve! He even brought his mistress.

455
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,643
The gall, it reaches this far!

456
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,855
Pinky, are you okay? We can just go home.

457
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,359
It's okay. We didn't come here for Anton.

458
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,451
Sure. Brittany, join her.

459
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,078
Okay, sir.

460
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,996
Wait, bring this.

461
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,665
- Okay.
- Don't forget that.

462
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,293
Here they are!

463
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,396
Uncle Benok?

464
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,773
Uncle Jetboy?

465
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,784
Yana, who is that lady?

466
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,786
It's daddy's friend.

467
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,663
Friend?

468
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,248
Yuck!

469
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,044
Don't listen to your uncles.
They don't mean anything.

470
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,588
I'll push them in the ocean.

471
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,425
Come on, let's play!

472
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,323
Just continue.

473
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,757
Look at that, babe.

474
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,759
So beautiful.

475
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,866
Yana!

476
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,371
Oh, my God!

477
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,705
Anton!

478
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,123
Anton!

479
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,125
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

480
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,544
- Yana!
- Yana!

481
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,048
Yana!

482
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,803
Yana!

483
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,139
My goodness!

484
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,192
What happened?

485
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,403
Yana.

486
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,657
Pinky?

487
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,355
Pinky?

488
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,903
What's all the disguises for?

489
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,656
I had no choice. You banned me everywhere.

490
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,867
You're making me look like a fool.

491
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,245
Is that what you're thinking about?
Your daughter almost drowned.

492
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,960
I didn't say that.

493
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,843
While you're cuddling with your mistress?

494
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,762
The nerve, to introduce her
to your daughter!

495
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,764
Leave my child out of your mess!

496
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,270
If I were you,
I'd just wait for the annulment papers.

497
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,403
I won't cause any trouble.

498
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,073
Just give me back my daughter.

499
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,783
Why would I do that?

500
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,120
What kind of life can you give her?

501
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,663
I have a job now.

502
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,333
What job? You didn't even graduate.

503
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,712
- I'm also studying now.
- Come on.

504
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,552
What quality of life can you give Yana?

505
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,398
I'm Yana's only mother.

506
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,903
You're the one who left.
You said you're tired, right?

507
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,613
But not with Yana.

508
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,368
Anton,

509
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,413
I just want to be with my daughter.

510
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,334
You already quit, Pinky.

511
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,586
Stand by your decision.

512
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,978
The coffee you sent me was too bitter.

513
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,814
Really? Let me get you some fresh supply.

514
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,900
No, I'm just kidding.
The customers love it.

515
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,571
We'll go ahead now.
We still have to visit other shops.

516
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,656
Okay, sir.

517
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,367
Give the bad beans
to the other shops, okay?

518
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,289
Hold on.

519
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,168
See? I've already forgotten
what you liked about Anton.

520
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,592
Actually, he was okay before.

521
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,636
He used to be kind,
always made an effort, very caring,

522
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,599
and he loved me.

523
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,979
Loved? Or just made you believe
that you were loved?

524
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,774
This is real talk.

525
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,735
If you really love someone,

526
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,445
you won't hurt them…

527
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,701
But I get it, you're just a human being

528
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,287
capable of making mistakes.

529
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,624
Just don't make the same mistake
over and over again.

530
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,250
That's insanity.

531
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:51,094
I see your point,
that's why I ended things with him.

532
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:57,559
I just didn't expect he would use it
to keep Yana away from me.

533
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,318
Yes, we can do that,

534
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,404
but realistically, that's hard.

535
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,949
He knows a lot of policemen,
even politicians.

536
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,952
We don't stand a chance against them.

537
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,705
That guy is a manipulative a-hole!

538
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,458
What's our plan now?

539
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,379
We'll take Yana.

540
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,424
I'm a director. You are actors.

541
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,513
Makes sense.

542
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,473
At school.

543
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,517
We'll pretend you're directing something.

544
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,727
We'll trick everyone,
then you can take Yana.

545
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,020
We'll distract them.

546
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,273
I think I've seen that in a movie.

547
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,486
They sneaked a group
out of one country and into another.

548
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,570
Can we do that?

549
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,239
- Yes!
- Yes, we can!

550
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,532
How are we gonna do it?

551
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,450
The first step is to put on disguises.

552
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,870
Make sure no one can identify us.
Then we'll take it from there.

553
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,221
She'll join us on the set.

554
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,347
Thank you for choosing

555
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,016
Boljoon Central School
for your film shoot.

556
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,561
You're very much welcome to film here.

557
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,609
Hold on.
Why do we all need to be in disguise?

558
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,903
You think after they see you,
they won't ban you?

559
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,238
I thought you're smart.

560
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,575
<i>We need disguises</i>

561
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,619
<i>so Yana won't have to keep another secret</i>
<i>or lie.</i>

562
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,538
<i>You're sure they won't recognize you?</i>

563
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,081
<i>How will it be a secret?</i>

564
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,916
<i>You want to talk to her.</i>

565
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,878
Of course, she'll share with them
that she has a new friend,

566
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,254
who is a friend of her mom.

567
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,382
Because if you don't tell her
you know her mom,

568
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,967
you won't gain her trust.

569
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,888
<i>Wait, I'm a little confused.</i>

570
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,806
Right.

571
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,143
She still has to keep a secret,
but at least it's not that big.

572
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,488
<i>But the question is what are we filming?</i>

573
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,740
<i>And we have to bring equipment.</i>

574
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,867
Commercial. That's what you do, right?

575
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,202
It's too quick.

576
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,248
- How about a soap opera?
- That's too long. Film?

577
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,709
Isn't it too expensive for a fake project?

578
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,670
How about a sexy film?
That's easy to do, right?

579
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,175
How about an indie film?

580
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,346
Just a few staff, key casting,
natural lighting.

581
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,849
Next question is what's the story?

582
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,059
We'll figure it out.

583
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:48,188
Our main goal is for Yana
to bond with your fake identity.

584
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,942
That way, it will be easier to take her.

585
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,408
- Hi, Yana!
- Hi, ma'am!

586
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,704
I brought snacks for you.

587
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,165
Wow, like what my mom brings me.

588
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,836
Open it now.

589
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,714
No, thank you. I already have snacks.

590
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,555
You probably don't want to take this

591
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,934
because your mom told you
not to accept anything from strangers.

592
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,186
How did you know that?

593
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,648
I'm telling you…

594
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,657
"Mommy loves her sweet pea, Yana!"

595
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,036
- You're really Mom's friend.
- See? I told you.

596
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,247
Here.

597
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,419
- Yes.
- Where is she?

598
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,757
Your mom's busy, but you know what?

599
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,305
That's why she asked me to give you
these snacks and the origami.

600
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,105
Yana, can I get a hug for your mom?

601
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,816
I'll pass on your hug to her.

602
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,078
The question is, what's our timetable?

603
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,413
When will we take Yana?

604
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,165
Are we really planning to take her?

605
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,042
She's being deprived of her daughter.

606
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,379
On her birthday!

607
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:40,258
I'm sure there will be a celebration.
That's when we'll take her.

608
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,012
But, Pinky, how about Anton?

609
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:49,726
Meet me on Friday at 3:00 pm.
Let's talk about the annulment.

610
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,364
Anton didn't send escorts.

611
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,241
Right, let's shift our focus
to Aunt Ingrid.

612
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,451
I'm nervous.

613
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,370
You guys take care of Yana.

614
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,247
We'll take care of the grandma,
since I'm a grandma's boy.

615
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,763
<i>Happy birthday, Yana!</i>

616
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:30,183
<i>Happy birthday, Yana!</i>

617
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:34,729
<i>Happy birthday, happy birthday</i>

618
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:38,024
<i>- Happy!</i>
<i>- Happy birthday, Yana!</i>

619
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,776
Patty?

620
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,156
There!

621
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,119
Teacher, who's Patty?

622
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,038
Who are they?

623
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,250
Ms. Patty!
They will be shooting a film here.

624
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,295
- They're checking the location.
- I see.

625
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,630
Grandma, please.

626
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:47,427
All right, but come back right away, okay?

627
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,346
- Thanks.
- Okay.

628
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,029
You know me too?

629
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,865
Yes, your Aunt Patty told us about you.

630
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,999
You came to my party.

631
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:22,921
Yes! We're part of the secret game.
We can't tell anyone about this.

632
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:28,510
Yana, I have a gift for you.

633
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,678
- Really?
- Yes.

634
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,514
Come, let's get it from the car.

635
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,817
Your mom is so great.

636
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,319
- You want me to poke your eyes?
- I don't.

637
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,115
Okay, we'll come clean.

638
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,159
The surprise we have for you…

639
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,878
Really?

640
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,046
Yes!

641
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,423
It's true.

642
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,094
We'll bring you to your mom.

643
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,556
I have another secret password.

644
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,640
This one.

645
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,355
See? I know that.

646
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,820
She said yes!

647
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,697
Come on!

648
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,282
You take charge here.

649
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,700
- We'll stay here.
- All right.

650
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,622
You will see your mommy in a bit.

651
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,838
Yana?

652
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,631
Then you'll go around over there.

653
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,841
Yana?

654
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,018
Where's the woman you were with?
My granddaughter is with her.

655
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,897
Miss Patty? Wait, let me call her.

656
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,192
How are you, teacher?
The party is that way.

657
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,461
Do you need a hand?

658
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,171
No, I'm good.

659
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,516
Where are you now?

660
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,604
Still here at the school,
for Yana's party.

661
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,105
Can you pass her the phone?

662
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,945
She's excited.

663
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,617
Let me through!

664
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,341
- She has a gift. Let's go.
- Yes.

665
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,343
I'll just go back to the party.

666
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,596
No…

667
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,459
Excuse me, kids. Let me pass.

668
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,511
Let's go now. Hurry!

669
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,765
Do I know you?

670
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:46,225
Yes, because that's Uncle Benok.

671
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,852
- Uncle?
- Yes!

672
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,312
Let's go now?

673
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,198
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

674
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,500
Hello?

675
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,503
Benok! It seems like
Anton has realized our plan.

676
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,797
Anton already knows. Let's go!

677
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,892
This way!

678
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,145
We'll go there.

679
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,578
It's locked.

680
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,422
- Hold on!
- Let's go this way!

681
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,215
This way!

682
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,388
Go!

683
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,700
Yana?

684
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,338
Not in front of the child, please.

685
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,676
Daddy, Mommy's here too!

686
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,602
Your mom and dad just need to talk.

687
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:57,231
But I want to be with Mommy.

688
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:58,900
Yana!

689
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,283
It's okay, babe. Go to Grandma.
Your dad and I will just talk.

690
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,624
- Go to Grandma.
- Come here.

691
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,084
Come here.

692
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:22,882
Anton.

693
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,054
We have nothing to talk about.

694
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,849
You're taking it too far.

695
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,227
Pinky has a right to my niece.

696
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,231
Oyet?

697
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,070
So you all planned this?

698
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,910
We might be foolish,
but at least we're not mean like you.

699
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,204
See? You're so rude!

700
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,207
You're rich, but you don't have manners
or good conduct.

701
01:03:58,751 --> 01:03:59,836
See?

702
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,172
Bro, don't treat us like that.
We're talking nicely.

703
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,301
Grandma, are they fighting?

704
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,860
We are leaving,
and we're taking Yana with us.

705
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,027
What did you say?

706
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,363
Yana!

707
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,160
Anton, Oyet, cut it out, please.

708
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,287
They're leaving.

709
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,919
- You're hurting her.
- Then let go.

710
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,672
- Let go!
- Enough, Anton.

711
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,133
Let go of the kid!

712
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,301
You're hurting her!

713
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,344
- Anton, you're hurting her!
- Enough!

714
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,680
- Let go!
- Stop!

715
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,017
- You're hurting her!
- Let go!

716
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,397
Enough!

717
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,107
- Let go of her!
- No!

718
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,860
- Please, Anton!
- Just let go!

719
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,530
Enough! Yes, I'm leaving!
Don't make it hard for the child.

720
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,008
I'll give you your gift some other time.

721
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,942
Daddy, why are you asking her to leave?

722
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,811
I can attend your party.

723
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,438
Really?

724
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,790
We'll go back to your party.

725
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,422
Are you coming?

726
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,445
Mommy, aren't you coming home yet?

727
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:23,284
Mommy has to return to her work.

728
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,744
But it's still my birthday.

729
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,372
Mommy, come home, please?

730
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,249
Yana.

731
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:35,171
I told you she can't come home.
Don't be stubborn. Okay?

732
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,305
You had a fun party, didn't you?

733
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,600
I'll make it up to you next time,

734
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,730
so he won't get mad. Okay?

735
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,820
Mommy, stop.

736
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:10,247
Teacher said it's also your day
'cause it's your birth-giving day.

737
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,167
Maybe she was just pushed to the wall.

738
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:33,098
it might have been wrong to push her away.

739
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:39,063
You saw how happy Yana was with her mom.

740
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,483
Yana will get used to it.

741
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,656
Besides, I've been wanting
to transfer her to another school.

742
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,200
She'll study in the US.

743
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:57,164
I'm keeping her away from Pinky for good.
She won't be able to follow her there.

744
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,836
How will you do that
without her mom's consent?

745
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,171
I'll take care of it.

746
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:30,823
Nanny Brittany, help me.

747
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:35,035
Daddy will take me to the US.

748
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,676
Good thing Velma cleaned this.

749
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,512
Okay, hop in.

750
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,807
Careful.

751
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,476
Okay, okay…

752
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,439
Hurry.

753
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,191
Hold this.

754
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,818
Okay?

755
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,449
- Hey, Elvis!
- Where are you going?

756
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,201
Just taking out the trash.

757
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,536
Let me help you.

758
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,580
No need. I can handle it.

759
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,582
Wait, let me help.

760
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:24,418
- No, just stay there, Elvis.
- Are you sure?

761
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:25,794
- Elvis!
- Hold on.

762
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,254
Elvis!

763
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:30,299
- I'll just top up my SIM too.
- Okay, if you say so.

764
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,550
Yes, thank you, Elvis!

765
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,677
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Elvis!

766
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,053
Should I close this?

767
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:41,185
My only dream was to have
a happy and complete family.

768
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,438
I thought I had it.

769
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,776
Is something wrong with me?

770
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,822
Why did he keep cheating?

771
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,204
Wrong with you?

772
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,249
He's unfaithful. It's his fault.
Why blame yourself?

773
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,503
That's what everyone says,

774
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:11,673
but when it's your relationship,
when you're the one being cheated on,

775
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:12,966
I don't know.

776
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,344
Maybe there's something missing in me.

777
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,137
If he thought I was enough,

778
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,349
we'd be a complete family now.

779
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,567
Benok is right.

780
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,070
There's nothing wrong with you.

781
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:40,577
If there's anything wrong,
it's that you married him and trusted him.

782
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,580
You should have left a long time ago.

783
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,837
It's hard to have a broken family.

784
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:56,093
What's harder is being in a loveless,

785
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,900
That devil!

786
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:14,653
What?

787
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,155
- Where are you?
<i>- Huh?</i>

788
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,493
Where are you and Yana?
Bring her back here.

789
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,788
What are you talking about?
Yana is not with me.

790
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:25,914
Please, Pinky.

791
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,042
You've quit theater for a long time now,
so don't try that on me.

792
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:32,421
You probably conspired with Brittany.

793
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,759
I said, I didn't…

794
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,929
Wait, is Yana missing?

795
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:50,897
Let's call Brittany.

796
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,357
Where will you search for her?

797
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,359
Everywhere!

798
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,032
Yana!

799
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:11,084
What happened? Anton is looking for you.

800
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:14,755
She begged me to bring her here.

801
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:18,008
Mommy, remember you told me,

802
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,940
Why did you leave? What happened?

803
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,736
Yana begged me to help her.

804
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:43,617
Ma'am, I know I can't go back
to that house anymore.

805
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,786
I'm ready to face the consequences.

806
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,748
What matters is that
you are with Yana now.

807
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,210
Thank you.

808
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,216
All right, let's go inside.

809
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:04,930
Elvis!

810
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,265
Sir.

811
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,852
Can you check our CCTVs?

812
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:13,855
Sir…

813
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:16,775
We don't have any CCTV.

814
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:21,238
Okay. Just rest now.

815
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,373
Just be prepared.

816
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,419
I'll wait for their call.

817
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,633
in case someone calls.

818
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,471
We've disseminated the info to our squad.

819
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,934
Yana's picture has also been sent
to our ports and airports.

820
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,900
He will take Yana abroad? That bastard!

821
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,027
Uncle, don't say bad words.

822
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,405
What's bad is your…

823
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:07,909
My words. I used bad words. Sorry.

824
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,372
Pinky, that can't happen.

825
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,624
He can't just take Yana and run.

826
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,419
Daddy and I will run away?

827
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,803
Daddy can't take you abroad.

828
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:29,806
Then just come with us, Mommy.

829
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,770
Baby, it's not that easy.

830
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,814
Are you and Daddy fighting?

831
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,358
Why doesn't he want you to come?

832
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,069
Why are you not coming home?

833
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:53,497
Let's just say,
we have a misunderstanding.

834
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:59,169
Then just make amends
so you can come with us.

835
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:01,880
So we can be a happy family again.

836
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:07,636
Babe…

837
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,056
it's really not that easy.

838
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:15,727
Just say sorry
so we can all be together again.

839
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,137
Thank you, Brittany.

840
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,350
We'll arrange your return
to your province.

841
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,981
I just did what I believe is right.

842
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,108
I'm also a mother.

843
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,405
And in your situation…

844
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,825
Yana needs a mother.

845
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,876
But what she truly needs
is a complete family.

846
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,841
I'm sure it will make Yana happy.

847
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,638
I'll leave you two.

848
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:03,770
The stars are beautiful.

849
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,230
Aren't they, Pinky?

850
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,147
Ouch!

851
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,525
Why? It's really beautiful.

852
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,487
Check all exit points
here in the province.

853
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:55,572
Yes, sir.

854
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,454
Distribute her picture so we can…

855
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:06,750
Yana.

856
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:27,437
Daddy, don't get mad at Mommy.

857
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:30,732
I went to her because

858
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:35,028
I don't want to go to the US
if she's not coming with us.

859
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,075
She heard your discussion.

860
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:48,500
Daddy, Mommy's here now,
so you can talk and reconcile.

861
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,096
Let's go, Yana.

862
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,582
Anton, she came after we talked.

863
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:05,702
- Say goodbye to your daughter.
- Anton, I can't be away from my daughter.

864
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:06,786
Please don't.

865
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,038
Don't.

866
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,966
I'm really sorry.

867
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:24,679
Sorry I left.

868
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,891
Sorry I was hurt.

869
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:32,645
Just let me return.
I just want to be with my daughter.

870
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:39,569
I'll be understanding
of your situation with Rachel.

871
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:42,488
I won't interfere
with your support for her.

872
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:46,618
I won't stop you from seeing each other.
Just please, let me return.

873
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:54,083
For my daughter.
Please, Anton, I'm begging you.

874
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,170
For the sake of my child.

875
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:59,672
Don't take her away from me.

876
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:02,383
I'm begging you.

877
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,177
Anton.

878
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,807
For my child, please.

879
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:17,815
Anton, I'm begging you.

880
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,462
Why are you doing this to me?

881
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:47,887
Anton.

882
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,016
Anton!

883
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:01,859
Anton!

884
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,826
Are you and Mommy okay now?

885
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,395
Babe…

886
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,649
Mommy won't be able to come, okay?

887
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,111
Then I'm also not going.

888
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:58,666
Yana, Mommy will follow you there.

889
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,923
Mommy just needs to work.

890
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:11,471
I will save up, then I'll visit you there.

891
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,228
Be a good girl, okay?

892
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:27,528
Don't sneak out anymore,
you might really get lost out there.

893
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:32,867
Promise, I won't sneak out.

894
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:36,704
And promise, I'll wait for you, Mommy.

895
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:30,424
Be a good girl, okay?

896
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,102
I will follow you there, okay?

897
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:43,229
Don't worry, I'll follow you.

898
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:53,114
Mom.

899
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:56,450
Yana!

900
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,848
Please.

901
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:39,160
Let go now.

902
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:58,471
Yana.

903
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:10,316
It's okay.

904
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:15,196
She'll come back. Don't worry.

905
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,215
I want to get Yana back.

906
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,636
I don't care how many witnesses
he will pay to discredit me.

907
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:29,353
Pinky!

908
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,439
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you.

909
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:32,648
Pinky!

910
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:40,656
Why didn't you call us yesterday?

911
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:43,909
Pinky, let's get a lawyer.

912
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:46,954
We can help you financially
if that's your problem.

913
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,587
Okay. Let's do it.

914
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,757
But I need to poop first.

915
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:02,928
Let's be real, guys.

916
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:06,015
If we take it to court,
when will it kick off?

917
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:10,811
And, Pinky, you said
that family always wins in court.

918
01:34:12,855 --> 01:34:15,608
You're such a buzzkill, aren't you?
Support a friend.

919
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:17,401
But he has a point.

920
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,571
What I need to do now
is to stop them from leaving.

921
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:23,324
Stop him? But our first operation failed.

922
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,448
Stay here, okay? Wait for us.

923
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,679
What are you looking for?

924
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:30,599
My mommy. She might make it in time.

925
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:35,563
Don't worry, she'll follow.
Let's go. We might get late.

926
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,682
We might get late. Let's hurry!

927
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:56,852
Yana!

928
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:04,777
Yana!

929
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,252
Anton, don't make a scene.

930
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:24,255
Mom, can you take Yana?

931
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:29,718
Yana.

932
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:38,561
We'll come back.
Let's just go to the restroom first.

933
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:54,118
Grandma, I thought
we're going to the restroom.

934
01:37:57,162 --> 01:38:00,916
Let's stay here for a while.
My arthritis is flaring up.

935
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,252
Let's go back to Mommy.

936
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,171
We'll return later.

937
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,007
Ma'am, do you want a massage?

938
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:11,844
Let's stay here.

939
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,058
Anton, you can't take Yana abroad.

940
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:20,686
Sir, are you Mr. Gonzales?

941
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,065
Sir, I'm sure you're aware

942
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:28,319
a minor can't be taken abroad
by one parent

943
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:30,696
without the other's consent.

944
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,244
But I didn't sign anything.

945
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:42,708
That's why, Mrs. Gonzales
reported it to us and asked for help.

946
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:47,880
I'm from the DSWD.

947
01:38:47,963 --> 01:38:51,050
You can't get through immigration
with the child.

948
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:05,356
Hello, Makoy?
I'm here at the check-in counter.

949
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,238
My joints hurt.

950
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:38,889
Grandma, I'll just go to the restroom.

951
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:51,568
Sir, this is the affidavit
of Mrs. Gonzales.

952
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:55,030
It says there that if there's
a written consent on file,

953
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:56,115
it is forged.

954
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:58,200
But this has her signature.

955
01:39:58,283 --> 01:39:59,952
It has also been notarized.

956
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:05,708
There's also a travel clearance,
which is government-issued.

957
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,876
That means they can fly.

958
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,839
But that signature is fake.
I didn't sign anything.

959
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:12,923
You're a liar.

960
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,804
She even puts on disguises
just to try to take my daughter.

961
01:40:21,473 --> 01:40:27,062
Sir, she did that because you're
preventing her from seeing her child.

962
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:30,149
You're the one
who has a lot of explaining to do.

963
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:35,028
Parents have equal rights.
You can't prevent the mom from visiting.

964
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:37,281
You shouldn't deprive
a mother of her child.

965
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,909
That's not true. You're a liar!

966
01:40:54,339 --> 01:40:56,300
You can't take Yana with you.

967
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:59,344
I am not allowing you.
I will never give consent.

968
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:01,430
Please don't embarrass me.

969
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:03,974
You can't run away with Yana,
and they're my witnesses.

970
01:41:04,057 --> 01:41:05,976
As the mother, I'm not giving my consent.

971
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,397
Huh? Anton!

972
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,317
I put up with your womanizing
and all the pain you caused,

973
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,903
even your mistress
and your illegitimate child.

974
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:19,364
I only want one thing,
for me to be with Yana.

975
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:22,159
I'm not even asking you
to love and respect me.

976
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:24,703
Just let me be a mom to Yana.

977
01:41:24,787 --> 01:41:29,082
Just that and you can't give it to me.
You're ruthless! You're so selfish!

978
01:41:37,674 --> 01:41:38,717
Then…

979
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:44,640
If I can't appeal to you
as a mother and as a person,

980
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,560
then, okay, I'll give this to you.

981
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:20,008
Mom.

982
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:27,975
Yana, let's go.

983
01:42:30,018 --> 01:42:31,019
Who are you?

984
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:33,647
Who are you?

985
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,857
I'll just leave.

986
01:43:39,087 --> 01:43:41,548
Let's stop them at the airport.

987
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:43,967
- Let's ask the police for help.
- That's right.

988
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,594
- At the women's desk.
- Right!

989
01:43:45,677 --> 01:43:47,095
At the DSWD.

990
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,889
I know someone from DSWD.

991
01:43:48,972 --> 01:43:51,016
- Who?
- Sheila.

992
01:43:51,099 --> 01:43:52,225
Who's Sheila?

993
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,811
Sheila is the cousin of the cousin
of my cousin,

994
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:58,690
whose cousin is a cousin
of my cousin's cousin.

995
01:43:58,774 --> 01:43:59,942
So she's not your cousin.

996
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,485
Not so distant relative, huh?

997
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:02,653
Hello?

998
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:05,197
Hey!

999
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,575
My cousin who is a cousin
of the cousin of my cousin…

1000
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:09,701
Hold on.

1001
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:14,748
Can she really help us?
Anton has way better connections.

1002
01:44:14,831 --> 01:44:16,166
Sheila, who's that?

1003
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,460
I think I should call Tol.

1004
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:48,407
I'll just go to the restroom, Grandma.

1005
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:56,498
What do you mean you will call Tol?
All he does is mess things up!

1006
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,041
Just listen, okay?

1007
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:00,961
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

1008
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:03,088
Tol, come here!

1009
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:05,424
Yana, give me your jacket.

1010
01:45:20,188 --> 01:45:22,983
We'll take care of Yana
while you stall Anton.

1011
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:27,696
Wait, even if we take Yana,
Anton won't give her up.

1012
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:28,905
And he won't stop.

1013
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:32,242
He's right. He'll just get Yana back.

1014
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:35,495
He has to be reported,
so he can be held accountable.

1015
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:37,831
Just let me be a mom to Yana.

1016
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:42,502
Just that and you can't give it to me?
You're ruthless! You're so selfish!

1017
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:14,743
Where are you now?

1018
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:16,203
They already took Yana!

1019
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:18,330
Anton, calm down!

1020
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:21,833
They will pay for this.

1021
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,753
I think I know someone who can help.

1022
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:28,715
Hello, Pinky?

1023
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,134
What can I help you with?

1024
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,513
Del Mundo!

1025
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:37,015
Sir.

1026
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,394
What happened?

1027
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:45,899
Why would you let a child with
questionable clearance board a flight?

1028
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:52,405
Sir, I even told him we'll check first
before they will be allowed to fly.

1029
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:56,618
That we need to verify the papers,
but he's very persistent.

1030
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:13,844
You think you're the only ones
with connections?

1031
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:17,305
What is this? A competition?
Hands under your chins!

1032
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:21,685
Mark Del Mundo?

1033
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:24,354
Oyet, how are you? What's up?
