I know the whole truth now

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,490
The truth

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,670
What truth do you know

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,360
It's just...

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,520
That

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,390
Bro, you’re the mastermind

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,420
You must think

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,950
I sent thugs to hurt you, right

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,370
I believe

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,440
You’re not that kind of person

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,230
Why do you think that

19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,340
Don’t you already know

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,720
I hate you so much

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,560
I might send someone to hurt you

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,620
So you won’t bother me here anymore

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,780
(It took effort to fool my parents
that we caught the culprit)

24
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,920
(Why did Apo bring up
the car accident again)

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,500
(Is he suspicious of something)

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,010
(But soon)

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,420
(This mess will be over)

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,720
(Just wait and see)

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,320
(I’ll make sure he rots in jail)

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,190
(He hurt my brother, after all)

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,330
(I’ll never let him go)

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,200
I know

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,110
Actually

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,590
Deep down inside

35
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,350
You’ve always cared about me

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,150
Right

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,000
What are you saying, I’m gonna puke

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,300
If you really hated me

39
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,430
Why would you help me investigate

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Right

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,950
Bro, why did you hide this

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,630
Honestly

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,970
I think your life is pretty happy

44
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,610
Everything goes smoothly for you

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,860
You’re about to get married

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,450
I don’t want you stressed
by this mess

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,900
And someone like you

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,950
Would never believe me

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,380
Bro, I’m sorry

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,310
I really suck

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Hey

52
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,970
What are you doing

53
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,920
Punishing myself, bro

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,050
All this time I

55
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,370
Always spoke rudely to you

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,440
Honestly, if it were me

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,110
I wouldn’t forgive myself either

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,370
Hey, that’s enough

59
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,570
Punishing yourself for what

60
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,050
That’s ridiculous

61
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,010
Thank you

62
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,310
Shin Ge

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,950
But there’s one more thing
I’m suspicious of

64
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,000
Why

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,190
The day something strange
was sent to our house

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,190
Ya Ge’s detective

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,010
Saw you go to the police station

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,610
To the evidence room

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,280
Then the evidence disappeared

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,840
I just wanted to check the evidence

71
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,840
And then

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,970
I heard

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,670
Suddenly the evidence was gone,
right

74
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,170
But one thing’s for sure

75
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,100
The driver who hit you

76
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,700
Is still at large

77
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,890
Sorry

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,410
Hello

79
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,250
Hi there

80
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,660
How can I help you

81
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,100
Do you have this car here

82
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,830
Oh, yes we do

83
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,630
If you’re interested in this car

84
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,950
You’ve come to the right place

85
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,170
I got this car just a few months ago

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
Want to take a look

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,980
Please, come inside

88
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,670
This is the one

89
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,490
It’s the only one left
in all of Bangkok

90
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,930
Bro, where did this car come from

91
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,770
Oh

92
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,710
He said it was just in a crash

93
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,200
So it got repainted

94
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,720
But he didn’t like it

95
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,350
So he decided to sell it

96
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,170
You can check it out

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
Francois

98
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,810
I found the suspicious vehicle

99
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,600

112
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,470
Hi, Ya Ge

113
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,740
Oh

114
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,900
Yi, what’s up

115
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,410
I brought some snacks

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,930
You didn’t just

117
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,750
Bring my favorite bagel
since you passed by, right

118
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,050
What if… it’s not just that

119
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,820
Come on, Ya Ge

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,660
I’m just kidding, Ya Ge

121
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,630
Actually… I heard the Siao Tawan Group

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,850
Is interested in the Penguin Home Foundation

123
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,460
I think I can convince them to sell

124
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,310
Thank you, Yi

125
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,190
I’ll contact you later

126
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,440
Okay

127
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,120
Oh, Apo

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,360
Here to see Ya Ge

129
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,780
Mm...

130
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,670
Yes

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,410
So Yi, you…

132
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,410
Oh

133
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,040
I just came by to talk
with Ya Ge

134
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,350
We’re done talking,
I was about to leave

135
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,320
I’ll take my leave then

136
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,790
Oh

137
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,140
See you another day

138
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,710
Let’s grab a meal next time

139
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,480
Bye

140
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,710
What did you bring?

141
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,320
It's...

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,160
I brought this especially for Ya Ge.

143
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,860
If you're full, that's fine.

144
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,510
You can save it for later.

145
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,180
Who said I'm full?

146
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,590
I'm actually hungry.

147
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,670
Come on.

148
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,800
Wow.

149
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,540
Whoa.

150
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,600
It looks delicious.

151
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,100
Go ahead.

152
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,140
Mmm.

153
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,750
Mmm...

154
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,980
It's really tasty.

155
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,770
Is this the work of a master chef?

156
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,490
Just now,

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,410
I talked to Yi about the Penguin Home.

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,400
He said he can help convince them to sell.

159
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,060
That's great.

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,670
Thorn, are you okay?

161
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,750
I'm fine.

162
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,970
Don't forget to find new homes for the kids.

163
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Don't worry.

164
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,490
I won't forget.

165
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,290
And also,

166
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,900
Don't forget to hug me like this again.

167
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,550
Or even go further than a hug.

168
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,270
Ya Ge.

169
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,780
This may be an orphanage,

170
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,460
but some of the kids

171
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,190
aren't orphans.

172
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
What do you mean?

173
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,150
Some of the kids here

174
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,350
live in the nearby community.

175
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,380
But they can't afford school.

176
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,090
So they...

177
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,090
come here to study.

178
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,710
If we move away,

179
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,580
these kids

180
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,340
won't be able to keep studying.

181
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,290
And the kids

182
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,210
will be separated.

183
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,870
They'll definitely miss each other.

184
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,570
Anyway, thank you so much, Apo.

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
I'll go check on the kids.

186
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

187
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,790
It's a pleasure to work with you.

188
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
Let's set up another time soon.

189
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,290
Thank you very much.

190
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,420
I'll take my leave now.

191
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,260
Alright.

192
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,610
Aren't you going to play with them?

193
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,570
Thorn.

194
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,870
Ms. Michelle agreed to sell us the land.

195
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,600
Even the signing date is set.

196
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,810
Really?

197
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,800
Are you okay?

198
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,640
Ya Ge.

199
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,900
Mmm.

200
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,470
If...

201
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,130
Can we stay here a bit longer?

202
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,470
Of course.

203
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,080
Why wouldn't we?

204
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,830
Hello, everyone.

205
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,210
My name is Apo.

206
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
And this...

207
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,160
This is Mom Rachawong Suriya.

208
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,820
Suriya Dechakorn.

209
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,970
Uh...

210
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,410
Mmm...

211
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,580
Just call me Ya Ge.

212
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,170
So, what should we play today?

213
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,250
Bad guy, go away!

214
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,490
Bad guy, go away!

215
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,060
Bad guy, go away!

216
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,680
Bad guy, go away!

217
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,040
Bad guy, go away!

218
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,980
Ah! Ah! Ah!

219
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,840
If you negotiate nicely,

220
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,100
I can give each of you a gift.

221
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,390
I want a TV as big as a house!

222
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,510
Okay, you want to watch TV?

223
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,900
No problem.

224
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,190
I'll take care of it.

225
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,500
Yay!

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,660
Oh!

227
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,270
Who?

228
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,910
Who poked me? Ha!

229
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,250
Joking, huh? Joking, huh?

230
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,380
Ouch!

231
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,370
I give up! I give up!

232
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,290
Yay!

233
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,860
Yay!

234
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,840
Today was so much fun.

235
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,690
Thank you.

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
Thank you.

237
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,410
Willing to...

238
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,610
agree to stay.

239
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,470
Thorn, you asked me to stay

240
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,400
because you want me to change my mind, right?

241
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,220
Those kids

242
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,280
have already lost their real families.

243
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,210
I just don't want them...

244
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,160
to leave

245
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,980
the family they love again.

246
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,910
Because I know how painful that is.

247
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,510
Is this for me?

248
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,950
Mmm...

249
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,160
What did you draw?

250
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,730
I drew us.

251
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,670
This is Penguin John.

252
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,960
This is Penguin Ya Ge.

253
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,770
This is Penguin Po Ge.

254
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,590
This is our home.

255
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,450
Mmm.

256
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,150
This is a rare group admission.

257
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,340
Let me tell you,

258
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,240
it's just like John's.

259
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,930
I wrote the name right on it, see?

260
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
Mmm.

261
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,350
Is this for me?

262
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Yes.

263
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,570
Thank you.

264
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,250
You must be exhausted.

265
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,300
(Tomorrow, sign contract with orphanage)

266
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,140
Suriya.

267
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,010
This project

268
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,860
will show the board

269
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,270
and prove

270
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
to all our partners

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
that you are fit

272
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,390
to become

273
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,000
the new leader of Siao Tawan Group.

274
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,420
I hope

275
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,560
you won't let me down.

276
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,730
I'll do my best.

277
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,760
I heard this project

278
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,980
was personally handled

279
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,190
by Young Master Suriya for the land purchase?

280
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,830
Does this mean

281
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,120
the chairman is ready to pass the position

282
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,130
to Young Master Suriya?

283
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,480
Yes.

284
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,540
If he won't hand it over,

285
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,480
I'd better be careful.

286
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,550
Someone might try to push me out.

287
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,870
That's true.

288
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,010
This orphanage

289
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,200
has been here since my great-grandfather's time.

290
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,490
Now it's old and falling apart.

291
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,490
I don't have the means

292
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,420
to repair it myself.

293
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,810
(Just as my great-grandfather said)

294
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,740
(wait for the land to appreciate)

295
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,760
(we just need to stay out of reach)

296
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,490
(big money will come to us)

297
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,080
Let's just sign directly.

298
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,160
Sigh.

299
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,900
(Buyer)

300
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,460
Meeting you, Mr. Suriya,

301
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,880
is a huge blessing for these children.

302
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,700
(Ice Penguin)

303
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,810
Hello, honored guests.

304
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,390
Thank you all

305
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,390
for attending today's press conference.

306
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,560
I am Mom Rajawong Suriya.

307
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,210
Suriya Dechakorn.

308
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm the head of the Cosmos Project.

309
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,980
I hereby announce...

310
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,710
Siao Tawan Group

311
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,060
has decided not to purchase this land.

312
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,370
Ha.

313
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,090
May I ask the reason?

314
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,450
Or did Siao Tawan Group

315
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,240
find a better plot?

316
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,790
Did the deal fall through?

317
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,540
- What happened?
- What's going on?

318
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,370
Because this land is the orphanage's home.

319
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,870
If Siao Tawan Group buys this land,

320
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,550
we'd be taking away the orphans' home.

321
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,550
And the kids from the community who come here

322
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,170
would also lose everything.

323
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,860
Young Master Suriya, what's going on?

324
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,650
We will change our plan.

325
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,460
We'll shift to supporting and developing

326
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,970
the orphanage project here.

327
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,840
And establish a foundation

328
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,840
to fund the orphanage

329
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,610
and disadvantaged children

330
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,680
across the country.

331
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,140
This isn't what we agreed on.

332
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,690
There must be some misunderstanding.

333
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,100
That's all I have to say.

334
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,810
Thank you.

335
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,970
Is that land really becoming a welfare facility?

336
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,920
- What's going on?
- Really?

337
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,110
Please answer.

338
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,130
Hmm.

339
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,350
But why would Siao Tawan Group

340
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,600
suddenly change its mind?

341
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,450
Hmm.

342
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,230
I think the deal is definitely off.

343
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,650
It's the foundation

344
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,100
that changed its mind and won't sell, right?

345
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,550
This young master is clever.

346
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,570
He turned a big project

347
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,580
into corporate social responsibility.

348
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,600
This way,

349
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,040
he goes straight to the headlines.

350
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,560
Siao Tawan Group's image has improved,

351
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,750
but from an investor's perspective,

352
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,400
I don't think they'll be pleased.

353
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,500
Exactly.

354
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,360
I think so too.

355
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,720
Where did my card go?

356
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
Did it go to the gas station downstairs?

357
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,660
Ya

358
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,420
What did you do?

359
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,380
Sorry, Father.

360
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,620
But you don't need to worry, Father.

361
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,150
I promise

362
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,050
I'll find a new plot of land.

363
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,340
It's not just losing a piece of land.

364
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,510
It's also losing our partner's trust.

365
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,140
Do you understand?

366
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,610
What about those children?

367
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,960
Those kids have already lost their real families.

368
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,210
I don't want them to lose the family they rely on again.

369
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,100
You've really changed a lot.

370
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,960
Who made you think this way?

371
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,880
Is it your fiancé?

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,610
Back then,

373
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,790
I had you get engaged to Apo

374
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,850
because I thought

375
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,670
Apo was decisive and resolute.

376
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,210
He could support your career.

377
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,340
But now,

378
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,890
I think Apo has changed.

379
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,090
Changed so much that I'm unsure

380
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,890
if you two should still get married.

381
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,850
Father.

382
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,920
I don't see what this

383
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,060
has to do with my marriage to Apo.

384
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,900
Of course it's related.

385
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,110
You've never wanted to marry Apo.

386
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,020
You don't like Apo.

387
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,420
Then suddenly one day,

388
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,550
you agreed to marry Apo.

389
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,110
Just because

390
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,190
you wanted me to hand over the business.

391
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,290
Yes.

392
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,770
I did think that way before.

393
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,360
But not anymore, Father.

394
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,660
I want to marry him

395
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,510
because I love him.

396
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,300

Thorn...

400
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,150
It's all my fault.

401
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,240
I caused...

402
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,590
you to argue with your father.

403
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,440
It's not your fault.

404
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,150
It's me

405
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
who should thank you.

406
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,620
Because of Thorn,

407
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,170
you helped me understand so much more.

410
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,190

575
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,190
I could never

576
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,680
happily watch our son marry that kid.

577
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,820
What does this have to do with Apo?

578
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,220
I thought

579
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,940
Apo would make Suriya more decisive.

580
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,720
But instead,

581
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,560
he's become even softer.

582
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,450
I'm not just unsure

583
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,230
Suriya

584
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,030
should still marry Apo.

585
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,840
I'm not even sure

586
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,480
Suriya

587
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,550
should still inherit

588
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,440
the Siao Tawan Group.

589
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,160
You...

590
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
You...

591
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,840
Uh... hello.

592
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,920
Madam.

593
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,470
Why are you here?

594
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,210
Um...

595
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,440
I...

596
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,000
I came to visit you and Uncle.

597
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,850
He's out, not sure when he'll be back.

598
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,290
But you can wait.

599
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,760
Since you're waiting,

600
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,340
do something useful.

601
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,590
Come help me cook.

602
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Okay, Madam.

603
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,220
Start with the chicken wings.

604
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,740
Ya likes the upper wings.

605
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,270
Add potatoes.

606
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,610
They're hard to cook.

607
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,340
Then add carrots.

608
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,200
Season it next.

609
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,470
Finally, add

610
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,220
onion and tomato.

611
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,080
It makes the soup sweet.

612
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,340
Mmm... smells delicious.

613
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,270
Careful, don't drool in the pot.

614
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,980
From now on...

615
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,020
Um...

616
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,660
Madam, are you alright?

617
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,150
- Madam?
- Madam?

618
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,340
Um...

619
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,580
Here.

620
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,790
Should we see a doctor, Madam?

621
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,120
Don't make a fuss.

622
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,330
Just stressed lately, I'll be fine soon.

623
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,580
Get me some balm.

624
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,190
Balm?

625
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,900
Hurry.

626
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,740
Yes, yes.

627
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,170
Uh, Auntie...

628
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,950
Do you have any tea?

629
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,410
Like chamomile or something?

630
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,520
Wait a moment.

631
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,650
Much better.

632
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,430
Feeling better, right?

633
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,010
When Ya Ge is stressed,

634
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,360
I help him like this too.

635
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,940
It's because...

636
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,240
I came to see you today

637
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,640
to talk about the wedding.

638
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,930
About Uncle...

639
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,000
He won't attend the wedding, right?

640
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,950
It's just...

641
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,730
Ya Ge and I...

642
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,050
feel the same way.

643
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,660
While Uncle is still angry,

644
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,100
we don't want to hold the wedding yet.

645
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,770
If...

646
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,770
Can I wait and talk to him?

647
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,600
I don't know when he'll be home.

648
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,940
Or if he'll come home at all.

649
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,340
Honestly,

650
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,020
he rarely talks to me.

651
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,490
A loveless marriage

652
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,390
is just like this.

653
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,120
Like strangers.

654
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,270
So I don't want Ya

655
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,010
to have a marriage like mine.

656
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,010
A lifetime with a stranger.

657
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,640
Madam...

658
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,000
I truly love Ya Ge.

659
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,200
I swear.

660
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,500
I'll never let him feel lonely.

661
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,840
I'll do my best to protect our marriage.

662
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,730
I'll help talk to him about the wedding.

663
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,760
Really?

664
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
I've seen it.

665
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,000
Ya is much happier

666
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,360
than before.

667
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,940
Apo, please take care of Ya for me.

668
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,600
Of course, Madam.

669
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,820
Mm.

670
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,350
Don't call me Madam anymore.

671
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,380
Mm.

672
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,130
Okay.

673
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,760
Mom.

674
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,110
Say it louder.

675
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,170
Okay, Mom.

676
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,050
Mm.

677
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,910
Honey,

678
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,390
Apo came by a few days ago to see you.

679
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,890
He truly hopes you'll attend the wedding.

680
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,170
I told you,

681
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,170
it's not convenient for me.

682
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,820
I don't know

683
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,570
in your mind,

684
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,490
who is right for our child.

685
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,650
Don't you want to see our child happy?

686
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,110
And you?

687
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,450
You brought the master here.

688
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,170
You brought Yi

689
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,170
back into our child's life.

690
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,790
Is that

691
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,080
what you call wanting our child happy?

692
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,560
I was wrong back then.

693
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,610
But everything I did

694
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,120
was for our child's happiness.

695
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,550
I don't want our child's marriage

696
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,770
to end up like ours.

697
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,980
But now,

698
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,200
our child has found someone he loves.

699
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,430
And that person truly loves Ya.

700
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,490
I think...

701
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,200
we shouldn't stand in the way of their happiness.

702
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,570
Alright.

703
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,930
Darn it.

704
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,500
Ya Ge!

705
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,380
Ya Ge!

706
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,870
What's wrong? What happened?

707
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,300
Father agreed to come to our wedding!

708
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,070
Father?

709
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,260
Yes!

710
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
Oh wow!

711
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,930
Calm down.

712
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,430
My Thorn is the best!

713
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,820
Speaking of which, you're getting nervous too.

714
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,390
I wonder if I'll freeze up on the wedding day.

715
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,880
Just imagine, Ya Ge.

716
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,070
If on the wedding day

717
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,260
I walk through the ceremony arch

718
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,920
and then trip and fall—

719
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,480
That would be hilarious.

720
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,120
Should we rehearse it a bit?

721
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,820
Uh...

722
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,950
Over here, this way.

723
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,040
You start from here.

724
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,400
This is the starting point.

725
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,840
Okay?

726
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,350
I...

727
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,810
Apo Yue

728
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,830
am willing

729
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,460
to love, respect, and care for

730
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:13,910
Mr. Suriya

731
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,070
Suriya Dechakorn

732
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,730
every day of my life

733
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,300
in good times

734
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,870
or in hardship,

735
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,140
in wealth

736
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,230
or in poverty,

737
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,300
in sickness

738
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,670
or in health.

739
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,370
I...

740
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,130
will care for him every day of my life

741
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,090
until the end of our lives.

742
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,720
I, Suriya

743
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,400
Suriya Dechakorn,

744
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,740
am willing to love and respect

745
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,740
and care for Phopthorn

746
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,460
every day of my life.

747
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,110
I swear

748
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,650
I will be loyal to you

749
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,270
in hardship

750
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,720
or in good times,

751
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,650
in wealth

752
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,440
or in poverty,

753
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,520
in sickness

754
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,560
or in health.

755
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,560
I swear

756
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,830
to love

757
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,210
and respect you

758
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,910
until the end of our lives.

759
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,860
Who?

760
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,100
It's me, Tailah.

761
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,200
Come in.

762
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,340
How are you?

763
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,450
Are you ready for today?

764
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,220
Yeah.

765
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,310
But—

766
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,800
Don't try to talk me into running away today.

767
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,330
Okay.

768
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,040
Since that day,

769
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,310
a lot has changed.

770
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,400
What's going on?

771
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,800
Actually,

772
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,730
I've liked you for a long time.

773
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,140
You probably knew that, right?

774
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,840
Hey—

775
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,640
But that was before.

776
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,520
Sorry for telling you only on your wedding day.

777
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,650
But what I really want to say is,

778
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,100
since you woke up,

779
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,760
it's not just you who's changed.

780
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,370
My feelings have changed too.

781
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,980
How I feel about the Apo after you woke up

782
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,400
is totally different from before.

783
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,340
So...

784
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,820
Why did you like the old Apo?

785
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,280
I don't know.

786
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,280
Really.

787
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,960
The Apo now is so much better than before.

788
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,650
I don't understand my own feelings either.

789
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,590
But I understand you.

790
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:36,630
Actually, I also

791
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,330
want to thank you for something.

792
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,840
For what?

793
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,750
I'm really grateful to you

794
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,790
for letting me be the good version of Tailah's friend.

795
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,610
Yeah.

796
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,960
What's wrong?

797
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,310
Hey, Po.

798
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,620
Can I ask you something?

799
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,090
You know Suriya Dechakorn's secret, right?

800
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,590
Huh?

801
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,360
What do you mean?

802
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,780
Oh, that.

803
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:32,570
Yeah, I know.

804
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,580
I really can't believe it.

805
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,690
That something like this exists in the world.

806
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,820
Wait, Tai.

807
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,000
Did Chan give it to you?

808
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:45,540
What?

809
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,560
Don't you think

810
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,660
they're lying and mind-reading us?

811
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,660
Hmm...

812
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,730
Honestly, I thought so at first too.

813
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,450
But then we learned to respect each other's space.

814
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,030
We slowly adjusted.

815
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,030
Now he and I get along well.

816
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,590
Really?

817
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,040
I feel like

818
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,080
he's lying and reading my mind

819
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,020
and just trying to make me happy.

820
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,460
Tai.

821
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,040
Yeah?

822
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,330
Listen to me.

823
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,080
He can read hundreds of people's minds,

824
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,310
but that doesn't mean he cares about everyone.

825
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,360
He chooses who he cares about.

826
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,200
Hmph.

827
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,110
He cares about you so much—

828
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,180
doesn't that mean he chose you?

829
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,620
Let me say it again.

830
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,470
You've really changed a lot.

831
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,600
You can go now. Hurry and get ready or you'll be late!

832
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,090
Go on out.

833
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,850
See you in a bit.

834
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,800
Thank you, Mom.

835
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,130
Hello.

836
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,710
Hello.

837
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,340
Hello.

838
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,880
Hello, Madam.

839
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,200
Hello, groom.

840
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,580
Let's take a photo together.

841
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,170
Sure, sure!

842
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,230
Let's take the first one.

843
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,390
Come on, come on.

844
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,500
Okay, okay.

845
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,880
No need to wait for others, come on.

846
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,230
One, two, three.

847
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:33,870
Alright.

848
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:34,590
Thank you.

849
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:37,990
You look even more impressive dressed like this, Ya.

850
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,280
You're too kind.

851
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,380
Where did the co-in-law go?

852
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,240
- Hmm...
- Is he in the hall?

853
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah, is he in the hall?

854
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,230
Oh.

855
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,050
He'll be here soon.

856
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,290
He'll be here soon.

857
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,290
Thank you.

858
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,750
I won't read your mind anymore, Tailah.

859
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:18,920
Please forgive me.

860
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,960
I'm not afraid of you reading my mind anymore.

861
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,660
Young Master Chanjak

862
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,480
Let's have a proper talk.

863
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,520
Really?

864
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,550
♪Our paths are so far apart♪

865
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,990

This necklace

868
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,410
Suits you well

869
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,870
♪Countless stars circle around you♪

870
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,060
I want us to get to know each other again

871
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,580
Hello, I'm Tailah

872
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,030
Nice to meet you

873
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,160
But if I meet you

874
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,360
I can still read minds

875
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,030
Nice to meet you

876
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,680
Is it Ya Ge?

877
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,350
Hello, uncle

878
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,210
I'm still upset about the land issue

879
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,240
But since today is

880
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,780
my son's wedding with the one he loves

881
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:19,340
the wedding

882
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,260
Of course I must come to congratulate

883
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,660
the two of them

884
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,260
This necklace

885
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,770
I gave it to my wife at our wedding

886
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,090
Now

887
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,990
It's time for you to wear it

888
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:43,960
Thank you

889
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,780
Uh, wait...

890
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,160
I'll put it on myself

891
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,260
Mm

892
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,050
Thank you so much, Father

893
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,140
(I've only seen this in dramas before)

894
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,550
(The bride walking into the wedding scene)

895
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,220
(This feeling)

896
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,050
(So this is how it feels)

897
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,040
(Thank heaven)

898
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,040
(for giving me a new life)

899
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,040
(for letting me meet)

900
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,180
(the one I'll spend my life with)

901
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,940
(Though I'm not the real Apo)

902
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,520
(from now on)

903
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,200
(I swear)

904
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,760
(I'll do my best to be Apo)

905
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,010
(and always stay by Ya Ge's side)

906
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,400
Who are you?

907
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,910
You're not Apo

908
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,030
Ha

909
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,020
What?

910
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,370
Necklace

911
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,840
Who gave you this necklace?

912
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,940
It was me

913
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,240
I've wanted to know for a long time

914
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,560
Why have you changed?

915
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,360
So...

916
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,430
You're not Apo

917
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,350
You're someone unknown

918
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,000
who took over Apo's body

919
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,360
What nonsense are you saying?

920
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,370
Mother-in-law, listen to what he's saying

921
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,360
This is my son Apo

922
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,340
What's your problem?

923
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,530
Speak properly

924
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,720
Don't accuse each other like this

925
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,210
Oh

926
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,920
Let's leave here

927
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,030
Fake things

928
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:58,870
will be exposed

929
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,360
one day

930
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,210
You knew from the start

931
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,120
he wasn't...

932
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,250
All I know

933
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,740
is this person

934
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,540
is the one I love

935
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,990
You've been fooled by that impostor again

936
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,840
Is that so?

937
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,340
If you still want to inherit Siao Tawan Group

938
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,090
You must be more decisive

939
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,790
He makes me a better person

940
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,050
My life is better with him than without

941
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:38,730
Suriya

942
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,770
If you choose that child

943
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,570
and walk out of here

944
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:47,040
you will no longer be
Suriya Dechakorn

945
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:02,960
(Ya Ge)

946
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,630
(Don't do this)

947
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,970
(Talk to your father properly)

948
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:21,880
Then from now on

949
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,170
I am no longer
Suriya Dechakorn

950
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,360
Son...

951
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,350
Ya, my son

952
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,830
Mom, mom, mom

953
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,920
Mom

954
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,560
What happened?

955
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,880
No idea

956
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:18,860
=With whom am I=

957
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,180
After the wedding

958
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,170

to a villa by the sea

All day?

967
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,000
Not just all day

968

It should be a lifetime

969
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,010
I love you, Thorn
