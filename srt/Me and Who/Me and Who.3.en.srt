I think this is enough.

that our love was real.

Regarding the incident,

68
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,583
the Internet users
have been writing us horrible reviews,

69
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:07,703
causing our rating to plummet.

70
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:10,583
Plus, the company's stock
has been falling steadily.

71
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:13,023
The board members have discussed

72
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:15,503
that we should fire this housekeeper

73
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,863
as a way to take accountability!

74
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:23,983

with both of you privately?

Sure.

Come on.

79
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:44,703
Can any of you tell me

80
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,103
what exactly happened
on that particular day?

81
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:50,223
It's my fault.

82
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,943
I thought the guest
had already checked out,

83
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,223
so I told Bee to clean the room.

84
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,743
Mr. Suriya, please don't fire her.

85
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,043
Then, should I fire you?

86
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,383
How are you gonna take responsibility?

87
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,103

88
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:09,743
and answer me.

89

- There's a message from HR.
- Oh!

90
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,223
Wait, Ms. Nid was fired?

91
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:27,103
- What?!
- Seriously?

92
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:28,023
Why so?

96

- Yeah!

102

Oops.

103
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,763
Goodness, look at you
being so protective of her.

104
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,890
Seriously, is she your kept woman?

105

What did Auntie Nid ever do to you?

106

as you are at firing people.

00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,479
Why sweat the small stuff?

188
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:02,085
No one would say anything.

189
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,679
Hey!

190
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,118
You...

191
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,199
It's against the rules.

192
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,679
If anyone sees us,
it's gonna create a bigger problem.

193
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,479
But you're the hotel's owner.

194
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,679
Who'd dare tell you off?

195
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,159
Come on.

196
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:28,805
Fine.

197
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,399
Hey...

198
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:36,287
Join me.

199
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:38,678
Don't even think.

200
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,439
Satisfied?

201
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:42,359
Now, get out of the pool.

202
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,759
If you don't get up, I'll be leaving.

203
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,519
Hey, wait!

204
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,536
Heh, game over.

205
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,567
Hey!

206
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,159
There!

207
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:19,109
Whoa...

208
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,159
You're so done!

209
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,679
Come here!

210
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,839
Come over here!

211
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,839
Miss,

212
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,039
the pool is currently closed.

213
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,799
It is. It really is!

214
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,559
You have a booking?
Let me make you a new one.

215
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,999
Please excuse me.

216
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,239
I'm sorry

217
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,639
for saying
I was jealous of your ability.

218
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,019
I realize now

219
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,079
how unenjoyable it is.

220
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,119
It weighs me down,

221
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,759
just hearing a few people gossiping.

222
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,719
But you...

223
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,319
have heard this all your life.

224
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,559
You're a freaking boss!

225
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,319
To tell you the truth,

226
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,279
I don't want to be as tough as you see,

227
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:53,439
but if I were ever fragile,

228
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,699
how could Father trust me
with our family's business?

229
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,099
All this time,

230
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,224
His Excellency must feel very lonesome.

231
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,359
If someone gave him a comforting hug,

232
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,504
that would be nice.

233
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,399
Did you just read my mind again?

234
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,199
In all honesty,

235
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,551
being able to read minds
is not all that bad.

236
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:39,239
At least,

237
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:42,198
it also makes me more empathetic

238
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,439
and less quick to judge.

239
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,599
Are you calling me out?

240
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,079
You're peculiar, you know?

241
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,479
Normally, I only meet
people who think one thing

242
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:58,959
but do the opposite.

243
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,559
But for you,

244
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,319
you truly...

245
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,599
speak your mind.

246
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:04,323
Huh?

247
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,772
Are you roasting me again?

248
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:08,279
You're saying I have no filter?

249
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,399
I'm saying that...

250
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,559
you're a genuine one.

251
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
What's your plan now?

252
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,680
I might not be a master of business,

253
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,520
but when it comes to providing service,

254
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm second to none.

255
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,560
Straining your eyes too much

256
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,760
can give you headaches.

257
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,400
Therefore, I, Phopthorn,

258
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,120
will be at your service, Mr. Suriya.

259
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,920
Give me your head.

260
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,240
So,

261
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,120
you have done this for someone before?

262
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,760
More than I could count.

263
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,880
Huh?!

264
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,400
Well,

265
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,990
I worked part-time jobs.

266
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,920
Don't tell me

267
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
that you were also
a hotel staff member?

268
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,440
Of course!

269
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Wait,

270
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,600
seriously?

271
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,000
I was only joking.

272
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,780
Well, it's true.

273
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
In the other world,

274
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,120
I did everything
that puts food on the table.

275
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,480
You must have really struggled
over there.

276
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Extremely.

277
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
Working as a laborer,

278
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,640
I was treated like a servant every day.

279
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
I worked my butt off,

280
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,640
but the people who took all the credit

281
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,160
were my bosses.

282
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,760
The ones like Auntie Nid?

283
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
That's so darn right.

284
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,720
It's like a stab in the heart.

285
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
Not many people
consider those at the bottom,

286
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,640
even though...

287
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,080
they do everything
to fulfill their duty.

288
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,240
All done.

289
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
Thank you very much.

290
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,840
Uh...

291
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,880
You can take the bed tonight.

292
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,840
It's fine.

293
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm used to the floor now.

294
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Sweet dreams.

295
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Good night.

296
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,640
Oh...

297
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,733
His Excellency
has left for work since early morning.

298
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,840
Uh...

299
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,970
Since early morning?

300
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,690
It seems he's dealing
with some serious business.

301
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,360
Young Master,

302
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,760
please enjoy your breakfast.

303
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,200
Right this way.

304
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,200
Prior to this, the renowned hotel
dismissed its head housekeeper

305
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,940
following an exposé
by a famous influencer.

306
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,110
Today, M.R. Suriya Suriyadechakorn,
[M.R. Suriya Issues Special Statement]

307
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,690
representing the board of directors
at Siao Tawan Group,

308
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,550
has come forward
with a special statement.

309
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,840
It is with my sincere apologies
for the incident.

310
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,030
I hereby announce our willingness

311
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,250
to re-evaluate
the hotel's screening policy

312
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,933
to achieve
the greatest benefits for our guests

313
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,400
and our employees in the future.

314
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,840
Does it mean that the hotel admits

315
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,680
to personnel issues?

316
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,160
Does it?

317
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,160
- Is it true?
- Is it?

318
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
Are there really any issues?

319
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,870
We see shortcomings in this matter.

320
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,340
[M.R. Suriya Issues Special Statement]

321
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,760
There are also issues
regarding employee well-being,

322
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
resulting in subordinates

323
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:40,527
being exploited by their supervisors.

324
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,760
Apart from apologizing
to all of the guests,

325
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,240
I would like to apologize
to all the staff members

326
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,630
for not appreciating their value.

327
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,370
From now on,

328
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,710
I will implement measures
to ensure staff are better treated,

329
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,750
along with developing
a healthier workplace environment.

330
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,480
Most importantly,

331
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,180
I will secure more investigations

332
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,810
to make sure
no employees are taken advantage of.

333
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

334
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,480
That sounds great.

335
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,280
After realizing
how the hotel takes action,

336
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,480
how do you feel?

337
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,840
I wasn't going
to take this further to begin with.

338
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,240
My intention in posting
was just to warn people.

339
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,800
Has the hotel
compensated you in any way?

340
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,800
Loads!

341
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,280
There were discounts,

342
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,200
not to mention Mr. Suriya
personally calling me to apologize.

343
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,130
I am very satisfied.

344
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,080
Thank you for today.

345
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,720
- Of course, thank you.
- Thank you.

346
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,200
Shouldn't you see him in person?

to hear your encouragement directly.

349

Yes, Milady?!

350
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,760
Right, the signal
is pretty bad, Milady.

Yes, Milady!

Whoa,

354
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm down bad for this?

355
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,580
This is a wise approach
to resolve the situation, M.R. Suriya.

356
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,600
Right now, our company's stock
is back to green.

357
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,380
Honestly speaking,

358
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,910
the board members
have become more confident in you.

359
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,930
I heard people saying

360
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,850
that M.C. Jakkawarn must be relieved

361
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,230
in passing over
Siao Tawan Group to your care.

362

I appreciate your compliments,

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,590
but there's still a lot to learn.

364
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
I guess...

365
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,740
there's a certain someone
giving you support.

366
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,160
Judging by your smile,

367
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,680
is it safe to say that there is?

368
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,920
Congrats, Your Excellency.

369

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,600
proving to Milady
that they're in love!

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,640
Um...

373
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
Your Excellency,
did you hear something?

374
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,160
Cheers to M.R. Ya

375
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,040
for successfully settling the issue.

376
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,880
Cheers.

377
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,960
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

378
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Right.

379
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,850
- Thank you.
- Ya is goated!

380
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,200
Thank you, everyone,

381
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,840
but I will also
have to give credit to Apo.

382
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,120
The reason
I could come up with solutions

383
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
is because of him.

384
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,230
Thank you, Apo.

385
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,520
Also,

386
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,200
please pass my gratitude
to Butler Francois

387
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,240
for taking good care of us both.

388
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,400
And, Mother,

389
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,120
thank you so much
for sending him to us.

390
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,240
Though, after this,

391
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,240
I'd like to ask
for my privacy with Apo.

392
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
- But I...
- It's settled, then.

393
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,240
You shouldn't have sent in
the butler in the first place.

394
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
He was merely
a third wheel to the couple.

395
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,840
I was worried about them, darling.

396
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,280
I just wanted to know
how they were holding up on their own

397
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,680
and if they knew what they were doing,

398
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,600
so I sent the butler to help.

399
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,920
Uh...

400
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Nevertheless,

401
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,480
thank you so much, Mother.

402
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
Having Butler Francois around

403
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,280
really helped us.

404
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,300
When we return home
without Butler Francois,

405
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,360
it'll be really quiet.

406
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,280
It's gonna be fine, baby.

407
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
I'll take care of you.

408
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,840
How about this?

409
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,680
You can take Francois in forever!

410
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,960
Gosh!

411
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,800
That's enough, Dear Mother!

412
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Come on,

413
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,480
let's toast.

414
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,200
Here,

415
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,400
cheers.

416
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,560
Cheers!

417
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,970
With Butler Francois gone,

418
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,680
the house is pretty quiet.

419
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,040
It's quite peaceful.

420
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,560
It's better this way.

421
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,010
I'll finally get to sleep on my own.

422
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,080
Oh!

423
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,080
Hi there, Master!

424
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,800
Master,

425
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,280
the boy in the photo

426
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,320
is named Apo Yue.

427
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,600
I want you to look into him;

428
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,320
I'm curious about what he's really like

429
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,260
and what tricks he has up his sleeve.

430
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,240
This is strange.

431
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,440
I cannot feel any energy from him.

432
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
What does that mean, Master?

433
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,120
That means you need
to bring Apo to me, in the flesh!

434
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,830
Po,
[Torphong]

435
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,370
I just heard
you were in a car accident.

436
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,380
Are you dead-dead?

437
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,420
I'm going back to Thailand.

438
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,370
Hang in there! Don't die yet!

439
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,720
Who is this guy?

440
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,690
Hitting Apo up now
after all the time he was hospitalized?

441
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,100
[Torphong: Po, I just heard
you were in a car accident.

442
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,430
Are you dead-dead?
I'm going back to Thailand.

443
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,750
Hang in there! Don't die yet!]

444
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,370
[Apo: Don't bother me with
any messages, or I'll block your ass]

445
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
That should do it.

446
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,430
Tai?

447
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:37,335
Tai who?

448
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,550
Hello?

449
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,180
Hello, Po.

450
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,210
How have you been?

451
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,930
My flight to Thailand is next week.
I'll come to you first thing.

452
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,320
Hello?

453
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,140
Hey, are you okay?

454
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,690
Why are you so quiet?

455
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,080
Hello? You there?

456
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,200
The hell's wrong with you?

457
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm not dead.

458
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,620
Uh...

459
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,620
don't interrupt my bedtime!

460
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,580
Why does this Tai guy
sound so familiar?

461
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,620
I can spend the night here if you want.

462
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,500
Is it better this way?

463
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
Don't you...

464
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
have work in the morning?

465
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,260
This is also an important job for me.

466
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,380
Thank you...

467
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,300
for keeping me company.

468
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,220
Likewise,

469
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,360
thank you for being by my side.

470
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,320
Without you,

471
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,050
I wouldn't have known how to fix it.

472
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
You're exaggerating...

473
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Your silly Excellency.

474
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,340
Does this rain

475
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,380
remind you of that day?

476
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,540
It does.

477
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,980
That day, I...

478
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,820
actually won the jackpot.

479
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,620
Too bad...

480
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,500
I died for nothing.

481
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
You didn't.

482
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,300
You're here with me, aren't you?

483
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,860
Mr. Groom-to-be,

484
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,100
your groom-to-be
is done with the fitting.

485
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,440
Can you breathe in that?

486
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,300
Uh...

487
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,080
I can.

488
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
You can?

489
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,060
Then, why are you making that face?

490
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,660
But this attire
is what Mr. Apo ordered months ago.

491
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
What about now?

492
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,100
Do you still like it?

493
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,980
I don't know. I...

494
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,740
I don't think this is me,

495
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,500
but...

496
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,140
if I changed it now,
Father and Mother would be...

497
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,340
Forget them.

498
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
This ceremony is about us.

499
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,920
I want you to wear
what you feel good in.

500
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,340
Besides,

501
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,700
we're gonna break up anyway,

502
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,300
so don't stress it.

503
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,780
Could I take a look at what you have?

504
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,700
Of course.

505
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,700
Here you go.

506
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,530
This one is gorgeous.

507
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,140
You do that.

508
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,620
I'll take this call.

509
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,170
Ma'am, could you help me take this off?

510
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,940
Thank you.

511
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
I'm taking off, Phopthorn.

512
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,460
This is...

513
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
my crush from the other world!

514
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,140
Tai!
