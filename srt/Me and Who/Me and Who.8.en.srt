Are you gonna stare at me all night,

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,880
Phopthorn?

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,800
I don't wanna fall asleep.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm afraid that...

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,280
everything will just be a dream
when I wake up.

13
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:14,353
In your dream,

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,520
did we kiss?

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,440
When we wake up tomorrow,

16
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,040
I'll kiss you again

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
so you know it wasn't just a dream.

18
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,140
Morning,

19
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Phopthorn.

20
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,640
Good morning,

21
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Ya.

22
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm...

23
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,520
not dreaming, am I?

24
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,360
If this were a dream,

25
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,040
it'd be the sweetest one, wouldn't it?

26
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,720
I wanna fall asleep and wake up again

27
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,840
so that you'll give me another kiss.

28
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860
Since...

29
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
we're both free today,

30
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,842
do you want to find something special

31
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,440
to do after this?

32
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,680
Anything's fine...

33
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,000
as long as I'm with you, Thorn.

34
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,960
Did I say something wrong?

35
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,200
Hm?

36
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm just not used to it...

37
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
when...

38
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,960
you call me Thorn.

39
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,920
I guess...

40
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,360
I'll have to call you that more

41
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,160
so you get used to it.

42
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
Right, Phopthorn?

43
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,680
Mm...

44
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Phopthorn.

45
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Phopthorn.

46
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Ya...

47
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,040
Yes?

48
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
- Phopthorn!
- Hey.

49
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,880
Ya!

50
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
Stop!

51
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,640
- One more time.
- Why is it so bad?

52
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
Whoa!

53
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,120
- Suriya!
- Uh...

54
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,520
- Father, hi...
- Hi, Father!

55
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
What are you two doing?

56
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Father, what can I do for you?

57
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
It's about 'The Universe' project.

58
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,960
Today, Master Libidude is free.

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,720
I want you to visit
the Dragon's Belly with him.

60
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,240
Of course, Father.

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I'll be there.

62
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,680
Alright, and take Apo with you, too.

63
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,400
Huh?

64
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I need to come?

65
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,440
I want you to help him
with this project.

66
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,080
Think of this as learning the ropes,

67
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,280
because in the future

68
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,280
you'll have to support Suriya
in many other ways.

69
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,880
What is 'The Universe Project'?

70
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,920
It's a mega project

71
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,910
that combines the mall, the hotel,
and the office into one complex.

72
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
A project this big

73
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
will require a lot of land

74
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,440
and a prime location as well.

75
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,920
That's why Father asked Master Libidude
to help with the feng shui.

76
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,320
When it comes to business,

77
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,040
every possible advantage

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,840
needs to be used

79
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
including feng shui.

80
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,200
Uh...

81
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,440
Do you want to do this,

82
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,200
the universe mission?

83
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,400
So this is the Dragon's Belly,

84
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,120
a plot of land perfectly aligned with
the Green Dragon from all four directions

85
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,400
with a Metal element entrance

86
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,960
that attracts wealth and treasure.

87
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,280
Without a doubt,

88
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,120
this isn't just
an ordinary Dragon's Belly

89
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,360
but the golden one,

90
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,480
the greatest land
Siao Tawan Group has ever found.

91
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,200
If you claim this, I guarantee you

92
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,760
flourishing, fortune, and fabulousness.

93
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,560
Father will be so thrilled
if he knows this.

94
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,480
Would you like to have a tour?

95
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,440
Don't play too far, kids!

[Wadtawan Home]

98
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Mama,

99
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,960
why do we have to pack our things?

100
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Didn't you say

101
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,040
they were just gonna build us a theatre?

102
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
That's right,

103
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,920
but during the construction,

104
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,280
it's gonna be very loud

105
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
and dusty.

106
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
We can't stay here in the meantime.

107
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
You don't like loud noises,
do you, Phopthorn?

108
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,022
That's why

109
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
you need to move somewhere else,

110
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
okay?

111

[Wadtawan Home]

112
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
Hello.

113
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,520
Can I help you with anything?

114
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,000
Uh, hi.

115
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
The reason I'm here today...

116
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,600
Uh...

117
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,960
Thank you so much, Master.

118
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,760
Right, Master,

119
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,000
please calculate an auspicious date
for the start of the construction.

120
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
Alright, alright.

121
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Thank you.

122
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Bye-bye.

123
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,080
I'm sending someone to find out
who the owner of the land is.

124
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,040
I heard
they were quite a private person,

125
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
not usually seen at social events.

126
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,440
Find them

127
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,600
and bring the land

128
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,280
under Siao Tawan Group's ownership.

129
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,160
Of course, Father.

130
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,920
Enjoy, Apo.

131
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,520
It's not every day we eat as a family.

132
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Thank you, Mama.

133
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,360
- It's good, right?
- It's delicious!

134
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
It's scrumptious.

135
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
Eat up, then.

136
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
What the hell's wrong with you?

137
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
I just want you to eat delicious food.

138
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
When are you gonna drop
your angelic facade?

139
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,920
That's pissing me off.

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,760
I only want you to be happy, Ashin.

141
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,800
If that's what you want,

142
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,160
then leave me alone.

143
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Ashin!

144
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,680
Don't behave like that here!

145
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
Get back to your meal at once!

146
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,120
It might look like
I only care about business,

147
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,080
but I don't sleep on acts of service.

148
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on.

149
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,680
A sec...

150
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,880
So,

151
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,040
what's stressing you out?

152
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,880
Do you mind telling me?

153
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,840
How do you know
something's stressing me out?

154
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,120
When did you read my mind?

155
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,105
Why would you think that?

156
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
Don't you think
I'm just getting to know you better?

157
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I just...

158
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,640
wanna know

159
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,840
why Ashin hates Apo so much.

160
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,800
Why?

161
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,240
What did Ashin say to you?

162
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm just curious, like...

163
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,580
No matter how nice I am to him,

164
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,240
he never seems to want to accept me.

165
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,640
Is it because

166
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,360
we have different moms?

167
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,520
That's why

168
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
he hates me.

169
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,805
I don't think...

170
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,560
that's the reason he hates Apo.

171
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,280
It's likely
because of Apo's personality.

172
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,000
I vividly remember

173
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,641
that one time

174
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,160
when Apo told Ashin,

175
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,640
"You're just a son of a side chick.

176
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
Don't stick your nose in."

177
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,240
Really?

178
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,840
That's freaking harsh!

179
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,960
Even though...

180
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,200
that wasn't directed at me,
it still hurts.

181
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And what about you?

182
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,800
Have you ever hated Apo?

183
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,840
I've never hated him

184
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,840
because of my mind-reading ability.

185
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,680
I understand

186
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,500
that people are brought up differently.

187
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
It's only natural

188
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,840
that everyone expresses

189
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,720
To be honest,

190
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,520
I never want anyone to grow up
with bad experiences,

191
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,000
including the kids at the orphanage.

192
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,400
Hm?

193
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,480
What's wrong?

194
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Your Excellency,

195
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,280
you make me fall in love with you
over and over again.

196
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
- Let me give you a kiss.
- Ow!

00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,200
Damn!

199
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,560
You act like you own the place, man.

200
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,404
- Hm?
- What?

201
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,760
You told me to make myself at home.

202
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,320
Alright.

203
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,800
Hey, that's a new arrival!

204
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,600
A rom-com

205
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,600
about a man who realizes

206
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,560
that his best friend can read minds,

207
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,240
even though all he's been thinking about

208
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,880
is wanting to have sex
with him just once.

209
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
What the hell is that?

210
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,680
Let's go with this one.

211
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,120
It's gonna be deep.

212
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,560
After all this time being friends,

213
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,530
I've never met anyone

214
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,720
who knows me as well as you do.

215
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
But from now on,

216
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
we won't be seeing each other
for a while.

217
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,640
Do you have anything
to tell me for the last time?

218
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,840
If you don't dare to say it,

219
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,560
then don't say anything at all.

220
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,040
I...

222
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,680
I've been reading your mind
all this time.

223
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Ever since the day
I pushed you on the swing,

224
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,880
I've known

225
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,600
you wanted to sleep with me.

226
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm sorry for leading you on.

227
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
I thought
I was onto you this whole time,

228
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,800
but in reality, I...

229
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,560
barely know you at all.

230
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
Can you please not go?

231
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Please...

232
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
I promise

233
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
I'll never read your mind again.

234
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Can I...

235
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,720
ask you a favor?

236
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,160
Can we

237
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
go back to being friends again?

238
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,920
No fucking way!

239
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Bro, chill out.

240
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,080

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,600
some people can actually read minds?

244
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,960
Are you drunk?

245
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
But I think

246
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,880
I wouldn't be friends with them
if they really could.

247
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,280

What should I get?

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,880
My absolute favorite is
mint chocolate.

256
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,800
Hm...

257
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
How about mint chocolate?

258
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,080
It's pretty refreshing.

261
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,680

with your fiancé, aren't you?

but the other night

271
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,120
he turned himself in,

272
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,240

Why did you turn yourself in
all of a sudden?

279
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,160
I was just...

280
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,440
hired as a scapegoat,
serving a few years in jail

281

I was thinking about it

was just to test you.

I'd found someone who truly knew me.

334
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,240
In the end,

335
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,920
a sidekick like me

336
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,080
is just a toy to someone like you.

337

It's not like that, Tai.

338
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Let me explain...

339
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,240
I looked into the day
Mr. Apo got hit by a car

340
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,320
and the day the Yue family received
a suspicious package.

341
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,400
I found a potential suspect.

342
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,040
Who?

343
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,280
Mr. Ashin.

344
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
I have prepared
the documents for you.

345
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,960
Please open
the desk's drawer to find them.

346
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,880
Every time I went to the crime scene,

347
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,640
I saw Ashin

348
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,520
sneaking around in the same spot.

349
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,880
And with my ability,

350
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,480
I stalked him,

351
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
which brought us to what you see now.

352
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,960
After that,

353
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,840
the police called to tell me

354
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,920
that the evidence
in Mr. Apo's case has vanished.

355
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,920
Are you sure?

356
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,040
I then went to look for more evidence

357
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,120
from the dash cam of the car
that traveled the same route

358
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,360
on the day of his accident.

359
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,840
I found a luxury car,

360
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,240
and only a few of this model
exist in Thailand.

361
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,960
One of the owners

362
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,480
is Ashin.

363
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
From what I'm thinking,

364
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,100
our target is going to
strike again for sure.

365
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,840

366
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,120

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,400
No, thank you.

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,920
Oh, there he is,

369
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
carrying some kind of bags.

370
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,480
It seems important.

371
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Trust me.

372
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,200
That bag...

373
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,320
carries important evidence.

374
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Ashin!

375
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,760
M.R. Ya?

376
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
How did you get here?

377
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,400
Uh, I...

378
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm running errands around here, so...

379
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,160
Are you alright?

380
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,480
Where did you get that necklace?

381
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,000
I've never seen you wear it before.

382
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,040
My friend bought it for me.

383
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,040
Why?

384
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
Nothing, it's just...

385
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,200
It's beautiful.

386
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,680
Excuse me.

387
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,250
Uh...

388
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Uh, Ashin!

389
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,960
Hey!

390
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,160
What are you gonna do?

391
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Ya.

392
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,400
Ya?

393
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,160
Mother brought some soup for you.

394
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,360
Where are you off to, Ya?

395
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Whoa,

396
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,520
look at all his work.

397
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,600
He must be so tired.

398
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,160
Don't push yourself too hard.

399
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,840
If you get tired,
come get a hug from me.

400
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,360
[Apo's Case]

401
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
[Apo's Case]

402
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,760
This is Ashin...

403
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,720
I'm out talking business.

404
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,080
See you this afternoon.

405
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,720
Phopthorn!

406
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,640
You're fine now.

407
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm right here.

408
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,160
I talked to the driver on your behalf.

409
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,920
Luckily, it was just an accident.

410
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,680
I thought
someone was gonna hurt you again.

411
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,520
Hurt me?

412
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,760
Who's gonna hurt me again?

413
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,560
Well,

414
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,580
that one's in jail now, right?

415
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,280
Or do you mean Ashin?

416
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I saw the case file in your room, Ya.

417
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
I'm sorry

418
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
that I've been
hiding this from you, Thorn.

419
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I just didn't want to worry you.

420
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
And yes,

421
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,360
I do suspect Ashin.

422
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,640
I don't think it's him, though.

423
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,200
He might hate Apo,

424
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,640
but...

425
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,440
I don't think

426
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,080
he's gonna do that to Apo.

427
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,600
How could we be sure?

428
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,120
Should we prove his innocence?

429
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,920
Hi, there.

430
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I'd like to have...

431
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,840
One egg noodles with
extra roasted red pork, no cilantro.

432
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,120
I'll have one rice noodle with
extra roasted red pork, no cilantro.

433
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,160
Thank you.

434
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
I didn't read your mind earlier.

435
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Actually,

436
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,280
it only works when our eyes meet.

437
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
Auntie,

438
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,040
can I get the rice noodles
I ordered earlier

439
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,600
for takeout?

440
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,640
Sure.

441
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,240
I'm sorry.

442
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

443
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,880
I admit, I cheated by reading your mind.

444
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
But because of that,
I got to know you better,

445
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,380
and I just want to know you even more.

446
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,000
The more I do,

447
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,840
the more my feelings for you grow.

448
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,440
Tai...

449
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,360
Do you really have feelings for me,

450
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,800
or are you just having fun

451
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,240
making a fool out of me?

452
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,400
Hm?

453
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Forget it.

454
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,920
Even though
you've been reading my mind,

455
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,280
you never really know me.

456
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Here you go.

457
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,120
Thank you.

458
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,550
Tai...

459
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,880
Tailah.

460
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,200
Tai.

461
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,440
You like egg noodles
with roasted red pork

462
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,720
and no cilantro.

463
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,120
You don't like coffee,
but you do like tea.

464
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,040
Hey,

465
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,280
I can drink it,

466
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
but I'm not in love with it.

467
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,400
You're a great cook and bartender.

468
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,120
Whenever you eat something delicious

469
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,960
or get something done,

470
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,920
your eyes widen automatically.

471
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,520
You might not realize it,

472
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,200
but whenever you're nervous,

473
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
you always nudge your glasses up
with your finger.

474
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,770
Hey,

475
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,840
just because you know
what I like to eat or drink,

476
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,480
how good I am at cooking,

477
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,360
or how I act,

478
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
it doesn't mean you really know me.

479
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,680
You always care
about other people's feelings,

480
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,280
but they never know about yours.

481
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,200
You said you were a sidekick
in your friend group,

482
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,600
but to me, you're not just that.

483
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,840
Tai...

484
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,840
Tai!

485
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
This is an amethyst necklace.

486
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,240
It protects you from mind-reading.

487
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,600
It's for you.

488
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
I want you to believe

489
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,480
that I really do want to get to know you

490
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,280
without reading your mind.

491
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,120
Can you give me another chance?

492
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Madam.

493
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,960
- Oh!
- Hello.

494
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,320
Hello, there.

495
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,880
There's my lovey-dovey couple.

496
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,400
Look, I'm trying to get in shape

497
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,000
for your wedding.

498
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Wow...

499
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
very fit.

500
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,920
Hey,

501
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,400
judging from how you're both here...

502
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,440
Is something going on?

503
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,600
Uh...

504
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,600
- Hm?
- Uh...

505
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,080
How about this?

506
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,440
Let's do some ice-breaking activities.

507
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,280
Come on!

508
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,680
Is this Apo's largest outfit?

509
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,520
Yeah...

510
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,560
The way it looks on you

511
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,720
is pretty cute.

512
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,620
Thorn, this is making you laugh.

513
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,200
- Come this way.
- What the heck, Papa?!

514
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,960
- There you go, Ashin!
- I told you I didn't wanna dance!

515
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
Come on!

516
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,240
Join our family activity for once.

517
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
Acting all stubborn.

518
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,920
- Let's go!
- I'm picking one right now!

519
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,000
What about this one?

520
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,680
- That looks fun.
- What's with you?

521
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,570
Good?

522
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
You, too.

523
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,400
You both piss me off!

524
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,360
No wonder a hot mess
belongs in a dumpster fire!

525
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,520
What?

526
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,520
Why are you
playing around like children?

527
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,440
Come here!

528
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Time to work out!

529
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
- Come on!
- Yeah.

530
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,760
- Yeah, we're still young.
- Go!

531
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,700
One,

532
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,720
two,

533
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,480
three,

534
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,440
- four,
- Four,

535
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,320
- five,
- five,

536
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,280
- six,
- six,

537
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,120
- seven,
- seven.

538
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,920
eight!

539
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,520
- Two!
- Ow, ow!

540
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,920
- Three!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

541
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,240
- Ouch! Ouch!
- What's going on?

542
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,800
- I'm hurt! I have a cramp!
- Oh!

543
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,720
- The cramps...
- It's the cramp, Ya?!

544
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,920
- It is!
- No! What should we do?

545
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,600
You're not as fit as I expected!

546
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,200
Three, four...

547
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,200
When Ya dresses like this,

548
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,640
he looks kinda wacky.

549
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,320
You okay, M.R. Ya?

550
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,120
Uh, I'm better.

551
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
Thanks.

552
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,440
Next up, let's do some squats!

553
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,680
Let's go!

554
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,640
One,

555
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,200
two...

556
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,400
Uh, Mama?

557
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,200
Huh?

558
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,600
The squats...

559
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,400
kinda remind me of driving.

560
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,120
Yeah, you're right about that.

561
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,240
Then, let's hit the road, shall we?

562
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,600
Give me a vroom!

563
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
Let's ride!

564
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,560
Ow, ow, ow! The cramp!

565
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,680
- Uh...
- It's on my calf!

566
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,200
- Oh, no! The cramp!
- That really hurts!

567
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,560
- Don't let go!
- Ya, are you okay?!

568
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,080
- M.R. Ya!
- Goodness!

569
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,840
Ow! Don't let go of your hands!

570
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,440
- Don't let go!
- It hurts so bad!

571
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,160
Can you give me a massage?

572
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
Uh, speaking of driving...

573
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,320
what happened to the person
who hit me with the car?

574
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,680
That one...

575
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,360
- was arrested, dear.
- Mm!

576
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,320
Oh, really?

577
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,080
- Yeah!
- Right...

578
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I tricked Papa and Mama
into believing the bad guy was caught...

579
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,440
All of a sudden, why did Apo
become curious about the accident?

580
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,680
Is he suspicious of anything?

581
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,480
M.R. Ya,

582
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,840
you've been stretching for too long.

583
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
You should get better.

584
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,920
Come on, let's get into a stretch.

585
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,800
Quick!

586
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,960
Alright, stand up straight, guys!

587
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,200
Let's start.

588
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,640
Stretch your arms up.

589
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,280
Go all the way.

590
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,080
No need to avoid me, Ashin.

591
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,640
I know the truth.

592
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
The truth?

593
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
About what?

594
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,800
About that...

595
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,880
you are behind all this.
