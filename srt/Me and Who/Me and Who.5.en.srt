Come rain or shine,

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
I promise

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,760
I won't ever leave you alone.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,643
Oh my!

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,840
How could you guys meet
before the ceremony?

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,720
Oh my...

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
- My apologies,
- Oh...

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,280
I couldn't wait.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Oh...

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,900
You shouldn't do that.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,240
You're the groom, so you need to leave!

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,521
People are waiting at the procession.

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,560
- You should be there.
- Come on.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,760
Quick, go!

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,840
Woo!

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
Hoo!

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,339
M.R. Suriya.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,160
Yes?

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,640
Could you

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,000
shout how much you love Young Master Apo

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,240
until I'm satisfied?

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,280
Oh, that's easy.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,160
I love you, Apo.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
What was that?

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
That's not enough?

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
I love you, Apo!

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
What was that?!

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,680
Suriya loves Apo!

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,680
Here,

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,800
please scan to pay
instead of a cash envelope.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,000
Whoa!

40
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,640
You're through.

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
- This way.
- Yay!

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Hi, Ashin.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
Groom and groomsmen,

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
do the limbo under the gate.

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,160
In parentheses,

46
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
show off your hottest move.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Korn, Karn.

48
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Can you help?

49
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,440
We have to dance?

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Yeah, come on.

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
I'm counting on you.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
You, too.

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
There!

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,640
It's your turn, Mr. Groom!

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
- There you go!
- Oh, oh, oh!

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,760
- Yay!
- Yay!

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Thank you.

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,040
This one is a quiz to see
how much you know Apo,

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
- Hm?
- so it may not be easy.

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
The question is...

61
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,040
Which picture shows Apo's lips?

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,960
If I pick the wrong one,

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
my groom will be mad.

64
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,680
So, you need to be careful.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
As easy as pie.

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,640
The answer is

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
number three.

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,680
And number three is...

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Is...

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
correct!

71
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,462
- Yay!
- Yay!

72
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,240
This way.

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
This gate

74
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,541
might be easy...

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,320
or it might be hard,

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,520
since it's all about

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,520
proving your love.

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,080
I have a question for you, M.R. Suriya.

79
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,960
What do you like about Apo?

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,040
I believe this would be really easy

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,200
if your love is genuine.

82
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
No way he could answer that.

83
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,280
He doesn't even like Apo.

84
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,920
When we first met,

85
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,720
I didn't like anything about him.

86
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
How can someone

87
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
be so goofy

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,520
and only good at giving me a headache?

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,440
What?

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
Is he just roasting me?

91
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,440
But in the end,

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,560
that won my heart.

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
I like him

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
because he's willing to do everything

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
without a care in the world.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,400
That includes his weird dance moves,

97
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
which I still find adorable.

98
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,240
He just stays true

99
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
to whatever he thinks...

100
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
I've never met anyone
as genuine as him before.

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,960
There is a lot more to say,

102
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,880
and it would take
more than a day to finish.

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,360
I guess I'll have to spend
the rest of my life expressing it

104
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,640
'cause I like everything about him.

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you.

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
Yay.

107
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,560
Getting through your friends and family

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
wasn't easy, though.

109
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
From now on...

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,440
it's your turn to get through my mom.

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,640
Huh?

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Well,

113
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
what do I have to do?

114
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,680
If you want Mother to stop spying on us,

115
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,680
we'll have to show so much love

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,400
that it's visible from Mars.

117
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,040
Compromise with each other, alright?

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,560
Communication is key.

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
May your love last a lifetime.

120
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Let there be give and take,

121
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
and always know when to forgive, okay?

122
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,400
Please take me under your wing.

123
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Stay together through
thick and thin, you two.

124
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,400
For richer or poorer, too.

125
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,360
Thank you.

126
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,280
As of this moment, the grooms

127
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,680
may now exchange rings.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,920
Give me your hand.

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,440
Thank you.

130
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,640
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,040
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

132
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,400
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

133
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

134
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,960
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,240
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

136
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,480
- Go ahead.
- Kiss your groom!

137
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,280
- Kiss your groom!
- Kiss your groom!

138
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,920
What's the rush?

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,000
The ceremony has ended.

140
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
Why do I have to stay?

141
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,200
It's more like you can't stay

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,800
because your heart hurts.

143
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,640
Hey,

144
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,240
what do you want from me?

145
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Wanna go have a meal?

146
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
My treat.

147
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,600
Okay?

148
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,520
Here's your food.

149
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,720
Thank you.

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Shit, I forgot to tell her
not to put cilantro on.

151
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
Do you want to switch?

152
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,640
I wanted the garnish,

153
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
but I ordered it wrong.

154
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,560
What's with this guy?

155
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
It's a good thing, though.

156
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
I don't have to pick them out.

157
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,840
What's the matter with you?

158
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,920
First, you stole my table,

159
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,560
and now you're stealing my food?

160
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,400
Alright, take it.

161
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
It's all yours.

162
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
- There you go.
- Oh...

163
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,785
Thank you.

164
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,040
Not a single matching chopstick here?

165
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,600
Wait!

166
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,440
Give me those.

167
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,960
Excuse me,

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
can I have one of your chopsticks?

169
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,718
Thanks.

170
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,880
Here.

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,883
Hey,

172
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,480
I could've just used the ones we have.

173
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,000
You didn't have to ask the other table.

174
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
No.

175
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,920
Something in this world

176
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,400
is meant to stay in pairs.

177
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,810
Mmm...

178
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,120
The roasted red pork is so good.

179
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,520
Here.

180
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
What are you doing?

181
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,080
Help me with that.

182
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
I don't like roasted red pork.

183
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,840
Fine, I'll help.

184
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Wait.

185
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
Are you okay?

186
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,640
Well, what were you gonna do?

187
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,920
I just have something for you.

188
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,800
It's a no-limit credit card.

189
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
Spend it however you like.

190
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,040
Is this a black card?

191
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,480
I've only seen this on TV!

192
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,360
I will be busy for a while.

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
I might not have as much time
to spend with you,

194
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,920
and I thought it wouldn't be fair

195
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,440
to leave you home alone.

196
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
So...

197
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,680
Feel free to spend it however you like.

198
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,453
Whatever you want to buy or eat,
go ahead and treat yourself.

199
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,920
It's fine, Your Excellency.

200
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,040
I also have Apo's card.

201
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,000
I know that, after all this time,

202
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,960
you've barely used Apo's money.

203
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,520
So...

204
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,760
take my card.

205
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,176
But...

206
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Are you sure?

207
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
I don't want to bother you.

208
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,748
Please take it.

209
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,480
After all, I told the Yue family

210
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
that I would take good care of you.

211
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,960
Thank you.

212
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,240
If you want to thank me,

213
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
then wear my ring.

214
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
Right, one sec...

215
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,153
Here!

216
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,320
I'm not used to it.

217
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,820
It's expensive,

218
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,940
so I'm afraid I'll lose it.

219
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Just...

220
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,240
don't forget to wear it

221
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,400
to my family's dinner tonight.

222
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,040
My apologies for the sudden meeting.

223
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,000
It's all good.

224
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,840
Thank you for...

225
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,960
inviting me today.

226
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
You're also here, Master?

227
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,960
Is there a special occasion?

228
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,400
It's almost Daonuer's birthday,

229
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,680
so Father invited Master
to read our fortunes.

230
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,200
He's superstitious, you know?

231
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,800
You can start now, Master.

232
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,120
Water...

233
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,830
No!

234
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,200
I mean, Little Master Daonuer's birthday

235
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,680
should be held near water.

236
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,800
I see.

237
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,880
- This will bless him with health,
- Oh!

238
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,960
and bring good fortune
to Siao Tawan's group.

239
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,600
- Oh!
- Ah!

240
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,840
So,

241
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,960
for Daonuer's birthday this year,

242
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,720
should we go to
our vacation home, Siao Sasin?

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,480
Great, Father.

244
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,160
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay!

245
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,760
To the beach! To the beach!

246
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,520
Right,

247
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,320
M.R. Ya, Apo, think of this as

248
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
your early honeymoon, okay?

249
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,520
Do I have to go?

250
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, you do.

251
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,720
You're my fiancé.

252
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,760
Consider this our early honeymoon.

253
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,840
Honeymoon?

254
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Right, Apo,

255
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,320
so...

256
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
you can invite your friends.

257
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,440
Tailah...

258
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,960
and Tor...

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
- Tor...
- Torphong.

260
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,840
Right, Torphong.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,460
I see...

262
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,080
Are you afraid someone might
interrupt your honeymoon, M.R. Ya?

263
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm not.

264
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,320
I always let my fiancé get his way.

265
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,160
Is he going on a trip or moving?

266
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,560
Ya is here!

267
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,040
Hi, you little monkey!

268
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Tor, Tai!

269
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,640
Tor,

270
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
why did you have to drag me here?

271
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
Why did you make me
watch them being in love?

272
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,160
And why is M.R. Chan looking at me?

273
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,920
Is he...

274
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,960
gonna tell M.R. Suriya and Apo
about the ceremony night?

275
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,040
Whoa,

276
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,040
I got eight presents!

277
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,360
Eight?

278
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Are you failing math, little monkey?

279
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,760
Including the ones from our parents,
that makes seven.

280
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,000
Huh?

281
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,320
It's not...

282
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,260
because Father and Mother

283
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
invited a special guest.

284
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,520
Here you are, my sons!

285
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,440
Thanks for having me.

286
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,440
Hope you guys don't mind me being here.

287
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,920
Yi?

288
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,880
Who wouldn't be, Dear Yi?

289
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,800
You're not a stranger to us.

290
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
Right, Dear Ya?

291
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
A special guest?

292
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,960
You've been acting strange, Po.

293
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,240
Strange?

294
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
This is how I normally act.

295
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,320
You look like a sad puppy, you know?

296
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,520
What?

297
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
What do you mean by that?

298
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,920
What's on your mind?

299
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,400
Mm.

300
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,460
Oh!

301
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,640
I wanna know about...

302
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,080
Yi?

303
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
Who is he?

304
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,080
And why did Daonuer say...

305
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,560
he was a special guest?

306
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,270
I knew it!

307
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Don't worry, dude.

308
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Since you're losing your memory,

309
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,560
I, Torphong,
will remind you of everything.

310
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Okay?

311
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,520
His Excellency

312
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,240
dated Yi when they studied abroad,

313
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,480
but they broke up a long time ago.

314
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,520
It wasn't because they fell out of love,

315
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,990
but because they couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship.

316
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Even though the old flames have died,

317
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,880
if they're this close together again,

318
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,930
that might just be
the recipe for rekindling!

319
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,040
Po,

320
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,320
don't think too much of it.

321
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,160
He just talked nonsense.

322
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,480
That's sus.

323
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,560
Normally, when I riled you up about Yi,

324
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,360
you'd be throwing a fit.

325
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
Are you not jealous
of His Excellency anymore?

326
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Why would I be...

327
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,080
when I'm officially his?

328
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,120
There, bestie!

329
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,680
What's on your mind?

330
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,120
Po?

331
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,520
Apo!

332
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,520
Huh?

333
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,960
What did you say?

334
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,880
I said, "What's on your mind?"

335
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,760
Right...

336
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
Nothing in particular.

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,120
So...

338
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,400
Why did you follow me here?

339
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,200
Don't you wanna be with Yi?

340
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,400
Why'd you suddenly bring him up?

341
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,520
From that look on your face,

342
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
you've dug into our past, haven't you?

343
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,840
Nope.

344
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Are you...

345
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,640
jealous?

346
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,440
Are you crazy?

347
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,080
Why would I be jealous?

348
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,380
Look,

349
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,480
we're just a phony couple.

350
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm professional enough

351
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,440
to stick to the job description.

352
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,360
I wasn't even gonna say anything.

353
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,640
It's pretty nice
seeing you like this, though.

354
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,400
Looks like Lovesick Apo.

355
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,240
What?

356
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,960
Hey!

357
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,040
Excuse me,

358
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,400
why are you standing here all alone?

359
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,720
Who's that?

360
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Right here.

361
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Where's the voice from?

362
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,680
Here.

363
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,440
Hey!

364
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,600
Right here...

365
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,720
Right here...

366
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
- Ow!
- Whoa!

367
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,520
Argh!

368
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,040
Hey, you...

369
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,100
What are you doing in there?

370
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,120
Daonuer wanted to play with the sand,

371
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,880
and this is where we ended up.

372
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,360
Guess I can't get away
from this guy, huh?

373
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,480
Hey!

374
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,400
- Whoa!
- Hey!

375
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,240
I had a lot of fun the other night.

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,240
Next time...

377
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,840
let's do it again.

378
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,800
♫Being in love for the first time♫

379
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,600
♫Breaks my heart♫

380
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Into pieces...

381
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,880
Get over it.

382
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
They are now officially engaged.

383
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,200
You'd better find someone new
than a bottle of liquor to cry to.

384
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Should I...

385
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,120
steal Apo back?

386
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,360
His freaking Excellency
doesn't even love Apo...

387
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm gonna do it now.

388
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Hey, hey, hey!

389
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,550
Hey, Tailah!

390
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,600
You're totally wasted.

391
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
Where is your place?
I'll give you a ride.

392
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,200
Why is this guy
taking such good care of me?

393
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,480
Is he interested in me?

394
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,560
I'm hard to get, let's just say that.

395
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,960
Ugh!

396
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,920
Let's see,

397
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,480
I'll win your heart.

398
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,420
About what happened that night,

399
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,200
I promise not to tell anyone.

400
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,640
It'll be a secret between us.

401
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,640
Tell everyone if you want to.

402
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,600
If you want them to fight over me,

403
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,040
then suit yourself.

404
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,000
That's not what I meant.

405
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Hey...

406
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,320
How about some coconut water?

407
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,320
Hm?

408
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,920
Come on, trust me.

409
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,440
There you go, little monkey.

410
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,080
- Oh!
- Alright!

411
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,240
- That's sigma!
- You like it?

412
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,000
What about yours, Dorky Po?

413
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,600
I gave you the field glasses

414
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,280
because I'll take you

415
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,720
to hunt for the Northern Lights!

416
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
- Do you wanna?
- Wow!

417
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,280
Do you?

418
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,600
Let's go.

419
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,080
This way.

420
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,760
Sit there.

421
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,840
Wow!

422
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,080
Dorky Po's present

423
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,440
is the coolest!

424
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,880
Do you like it?

425
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,520
I like it so much!

426
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,800
Daonuer,

427
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,440
you haven't opened my present.

428
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,000
You wanna take a look?

429
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,560
Wow, Yi also has a present for you.

430
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Come on, dear.

431
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,360
There you go.

432
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,800
Take a look.

433
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,840
- Let me help you.
- Whoa!!

434
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,920
This is exactly what I want!

435
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,240
You know me by heart, Yi!

436
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,520
Wow, that's a big box.

437
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Do you like it, dear?

438
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,800
I really do!

439
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,090
What an excellent pick, Yi.

440
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,040
Don't think too much of it.

441
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,680
The present, I mean.

442
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Daonuer was just talking nonsense.

443
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
What's your birthday?

444
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Why are you asking?

445
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,560
Ever since you said

446
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,240
we should get to know each other more,

447
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
I still...

448
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,920
know nothing about you.

449
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,240
If I didn't read your mind,

450
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,800
I wouldn't know anything
about you either.

451
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,720
I was born on November 17.

452
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
What about you?

453
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,640
I...

454
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,400
I grew up in an orphanage.

455
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,000
All those cakes and presents...

456
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I never got one.

457
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,280
Then,

458
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,320
let's take the day
you woke up in this world

459
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,040
as your birthday.

460
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,560
Sounds good?

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,840
Come on.

462
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640
Let's go.

463
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,280
♫Happy Birthday to you♫

464
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,720
- Yay!
- Yeah!

465
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,200
Happy Birthday, Daonuer.

466
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,480
Seeing you with this happy family,

467
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,480
and not being all alone
like I was in the other world,

468
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,480
makes me happy.

469
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,520
You're not Apo.

470
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,000
You're not Apo!

471
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,560
Uh...

472
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,720
What did you say, Daonuer?

473
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,440
What do you mean he's not Apo?

474
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,760
Uh...

475
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
he's probably sleepy.

476
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,240
- Chan!
- Hm?

477
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,530
Could you help him get to bed?

478
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,160
Let's all eat the cake
tomorrow morning.

479
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,400
A little mix of gin,

480
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
a splash of vodka,

481
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
lime juice,

482
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,760
and finished with some blue syrup.

483
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,520
Super Moon is ready.

484
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's take this to Apo.

485
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,080
Hey, wait.

486
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,160
Can I have a glass of that?

487
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,520
Why would I give it to you?

488
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,400
I'm not your bartender or anything.

489
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,600
How about a little wipe?

490
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,040
Apo,

491
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,600
mind if I join?

492
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,040
When I broke up with Ya,

493
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,720
I was devastated.

494
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
But I would be even more devastated

495
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
to see Ya date someone else.

496
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,840
Uh...

497
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,720
I'm sorry that...

498
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm that person.

499
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,200
I...

500
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,120
That's not what I meant.

501
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,480
I just wanted to tell you...

502
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,760
I'm really happy
that you're that person.

503
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,040
Honestly,

504
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,360
when I first heard it was you,

505
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,040
I felt so bad.

506
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,440
But after seeing you today,

507
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,240
I'm sure

508
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
you will never make Ya sad.

509
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,200
Right,

510
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,520
I remember you're pretty good
at making cocktails.

511
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Shit!

512
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,480
I've only made drinks
while working at Y MART.

513
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,840
Does a punch count as a cocktail?

514
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,560
Um...

515
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm not that good.

516
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,880
Can you make me a glass?

517
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,120
We can toast to our friendship.

518
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,640
Seriously, do I need to?

519
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Uh...

520
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,960
Sure.

521
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,360
What kind of drinks do you like?

522
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,360
Can I get something sour and refreshing?

523
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,900
Sour and refreshing...

524
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,120
A little bit of this,

525
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,760
some lime juice,

526
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,480
and some spirits.

527
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,520
That's it.

528
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Here you go.

529
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,920
Thank you.

530
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh?

531
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,680
Aren't you gonna drink with me?

532
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,160
I'm not much of a drinker.

533
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,400
Did you forget

534
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,520
that you used to be a heavyweight?

535
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,000
Now that you mention it,

536
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm getting thirsty.

537
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,420
Just kidding.

538
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,600
It's okay if you don't drink.

539
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,400
No, that's impossible!

540
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,560
To our friendship.

541
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,240
Mm.

542
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
I'll get a glass, then.

543
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,000
Sure.

544
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,840
Come on.

545
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,280
Let's cheers.

546
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,560
To our friendship, right?

547
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,160
Cheers!

548
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,840
Cheers.

549
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
That is awesome!

550
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,550
You can open your own bar with this.

551
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
I'm not that good.

552
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,160
It really is awesome!

553
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,240
I just tossed things...

554
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
Huh?

555
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,320
I mean,

556
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
I just did it casually.

557
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,200
Oh...

558
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,160
Alright, it's nice to meet you.

559
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
Yi, are you alright?

560
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,800
Hey! Yi!

561
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,680
Yi!

562
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,120
Yi, what's wrong?!

563
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,040
Are you okay?

564
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,480
Can anyone help us down here?

565
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,120
- Yi... Please help!
- Yi!

566
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,960
Yi!

567
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,580
Dear, what's wrong?!

568
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,680
What did you do to him, huh?

569
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,440
Ya!

570
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,920
- Come see him!
- Yi, what's the matter?

571
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
What happened?

572
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,280
Apo...

573
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,000
Yi...

574
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,600
Ya.

575
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,600
Yes?

576
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,200
Stay with me!

577
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,080
It's peach.
There's some peach in this glass.

578
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
He's allergic to peaches.

579
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,440
Take this.

580
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,360
I didn't put any peach in this.

581
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,560
You!

582
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,960
You poisoned Yi, didn't you?

583
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,440
Calm down, Mother...

584
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,120
Apo really didn't know...

585
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,360
And when Apo made us drinks,

586
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,600
I didn't tell him about this...

587
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,080
It's my fault...

588
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,080
It's okay, Yi, you don't have to talk.

589
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,200
Ya,

590
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,960
give him his meds for the allergy.

591
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
- Go!
- Of course.

592
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,880
Come on, Yi.

593
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,120
- Get up.
- Can you, dear?

594
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,080
Just a bit more.

595
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Breathe.

596
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,880
Hey.

597
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,920
Hey!

598
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,400
What are you doing here by yourself?

599
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,160
I looked for you everywhere.

600
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,920
You're still following me?

601
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,240
You're afraid I'll get in between
Apo and your brother, right?

602
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,960
No worries.

603
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
I won't steal your brother's fiancé.

604
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,280
Who said I followed you...

605
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,880
for that reason?

606
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,360
I was scared you might jump
into that pool and not make it out.

607
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,280
Are you feeling better?

608
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,200
Yeah.

609
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,120
Thank you so much, Ya.

610
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,560
And...

611
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,920
Do you remember that time
we went to a bar in the U.S.

612
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,560
and I had an allergic reaction?

613
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,920
It was so late
that no rides were available,

614
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,760
and you carried me on your back
to the hospital.

615
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,640
Yeah, I do.

616
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,960
I also remember
that after you got better,

617
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,800
my back hurt for a week,

618
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,720
and you ended up taking care of me.

619
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,680
I...

620
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm sorry, Ya,

621
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,960
that I broke up with you.

622
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,760
Honestly, I was a jerk.

623
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
I never thought

624
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,480
one sentence would be
the reason I never saw you again.

625
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,880
By the time we met again,

626
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,400
you were already engaged to Apo.

627
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,560
As for this anniversary gift...

628
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't think it's for me anymore.

629
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,120
I'd better give it back to you.

630
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,320
I already gave it to you,

631
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
so please keep it.

632
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,640
Thank you, Ya.

633
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,520
I'll keep it safe.

634
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
So...

635
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,720
just no more peaches, alright?

636
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,880
- Hey! Po?
- Tor!

637
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
Why are you here this late?

638
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,040
Drink with me!

639
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Right now?!

640
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,440
Hey, Po!

641
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,840
Shit, slow down, Po!

642
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,720
- Easy!
- Chill!

643
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,120
Po, Po, Po!

644
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,000
Po!

645
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,720
Take it easy!

646
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,120
- Are you gonna finish the whole bottle?
- Leave me alone!

647
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,200
- Jeez!
- Stop!

648
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
Stop it!

649
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,280
Easy!

650
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,640
You can't do that. It's harmful!

651
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,440
- That's unhealthy!
- Po, that's pure liquor!

652
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,360
Here, Your Excellency.

653
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,720
You can see for yourself.

654
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,920
Thanks.

655
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,640
I'll handle it from here.

656
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,480
Please don't bother.

657
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,440
Who's this?!

658
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,120
Let go of me...

659
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Ow!

660
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,960
Who are you?

661
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Tor, let go of me!

662
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,560
Best of luck, then.

663
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,080
Hey, don't move.

664
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,440
Ow...

665
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,840
Who's this?

666
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,600
Oh!

667
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,200
It's Mr. Fiancé!

668
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,480
My fiancé...

669
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,440
But...

670
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,920
he's just Mr. Phony Fiancé.

671
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,160
Damn,

672
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,600
I thought I got reincarnated

673
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,680
as the main character,

674
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,800
but it turns out I'm the villain.

675
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
You watched way too many dramas.

676
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,640
The main character or the villain?

677
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,800
There was no such thing.

678
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,360
Come on, go wash up.

679
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,120
No!

680
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,280
Why do you care?

681
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,320
Go take care of your main one.

682
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,080
If, by that, you mean Yi,

683
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,200
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

684
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,640
No way!

685
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
No way!

686
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,320
No way! No way!

687
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,440
No way, no way, no way!

688
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
I know

689
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,560
that your mind

690
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,440
and your heart

691
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,360
only have room for Yi.

692
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,720
Yi, Yi

693
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,120
Yi, Yi, Yi,

694
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,080
Yi...

695
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Sometimes...

696
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,120
I really wish you could read minds,

697
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,760
so you'd know what I think.

698
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,920
Did he just kiss me?

699
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,120
No... No, he didn't.

700
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,240
It was just a touch of the lips.

701
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,840
Kiss me again if you dare.

702
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,880
Please tell me

703
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,680
you don't still have feelings for him.

704
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,880
Can we kiss again?

705
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,480
Please?

706
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Please, please, please?
