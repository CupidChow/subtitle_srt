8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,440
God shouldn't have sent me here
to live as Apo in the first place.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,040
I really don't deserve this life.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,440
Without me,

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,240
Ya wouldn't have had
to go through something like this.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,720
Don't blame yourself.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,160
It's not your fault.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,040
No matter what people think,

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,840
I'll be right by your side.

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,000
Will you...

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,240
stay by my side forever,

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Phopthorn?

19
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,600
Ya?

20
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,880
Oh...

21
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,200
Phopthorn.

22
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Are you awake?

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,880
Do you want to get some more sleep?

24
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
You were driving all night.

25
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
The sun is so beautiful now.

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,000
If I sleep, it's gonna be such a shame.

27
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,200
As long as the sun keeps rising

28
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,200
and the world doesn't end,

29
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,880
we can still...

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,680
hope...

31
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,480
that everything will work out, right?

32
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,240
As long as you're with me,

33
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
it definitely will.

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,080
Thorn...

35
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
I'm no longer M.R. Suriya,

36
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,720
His Excellency,

37
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
or part of the Suriyadechakorn family.

38
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,560
All I ask is to be your Suriya.

39
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,160
I will forever be your Phopthorn.

40
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,880
To mark the start of our new life,

41
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,480
I won't spend a single dime
of what I earned as a Suriyadechakorn.

42
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Wait, you can't do that.

43
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,080
That's your wedding ring.

[Pawnshop]

45
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
My bad.

46
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,960
I was too invested.

47
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,520
This is the watch...

48
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,360
I put all my blood, sweat,
and tears into.

49
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,520
Could you give me an estimate on this?

50
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,160
That's 4,000 baht.

51
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Huh? That's all?!

52
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,080
But I bought it for a million!

53
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
A million?!

54
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
Damn right.

55
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,480
You can't judge its value
just by the weight.

56
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
That's how it's done here.

57
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,960
If it's not heavy, then it's not pricey.

58
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,520
"If it's not heavy,
then it's not pricey"?

59
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Let's go.

60
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,920
For our future,

61
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,160
we can't live extravagantly.

62
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,880
The first thing
we'll invest in is a house,

63
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
one that's just alright to live in

64
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
and inexpensive.

65
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,800
We'll later earn money
to make it a home.

66
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
Do you think you can make it here?

67
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
Of course.

68
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Can you?

69
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,840
Sure thing.

70
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,880
I love it, actually.

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
We have a big balcony

72
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
with a beach view.

73
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,000
Now that we have the house,

74
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
we need to find a job.

75
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
Hey, hey!

76
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,960
Look.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
[We're hiring]

78
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Let's go.

79
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,360
I won't use any
of my Suriyadechakorn connections.

80
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,240
I'll find a job using my own potential.

81
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm here to apply for a job.

82
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,560
What position are you interested in?

83
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
A CEO.

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,480
I have an MBA
from an Ivy League university,

85
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,720
interned at a 5-star hotel,

86
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,840
and served as an executive
at Siao Tawan Group.

87
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,760
Do you want my resume
forwarded to your email?

88
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,880
Oh...

89
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,560
Why don't we start
with cutting the lawn?

90
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,440
Whoa!

91
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,400
Let me see.

92
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm sorry, Phopthorn.

93
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,600
I brought you here to struggle.

94
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
This is what I'm good at.

96
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Don't think too much of it.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
You can use mine for now.

98
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,680
I'll be right back.

99
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Whoa, that smells divine.

100
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,560
Be careful, it's hot.

101
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
See?

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
I knew it.

103
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It's hot!

104
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,680
Look.

105
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
This is how it's done.

106
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,960
Peel off the lid, fold it,

107
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
and shape it nicely into a cup.

108
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
And now you have a tiny cup.

109
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,320
You're gonna eat it just like that?

110
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached...

111
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,600
- Honey!
- Where's His goddamn Serene Highness?

112
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Tell him to speak with me immediately!

113
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
Where is he?!

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Honey, calm down,

115
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,840
or your blood pressure will rise.

116
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
Tycoon Meng.

117
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
Move! Don't get in my way!

118
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
Honey.

119
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Honey...

120
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
Where has that son of yours taken mine?

121
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,560
Didn't you hear on that day

122
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,440
that Suriya was no longer my son?

123
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,920
Don't you think
you should do something?

124
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,720
If you let them

125
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,240
run away for too long,

126
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,880
the one who will suffer most
is my son, Apo!

127
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,280
What would that brat be suffering from?

128
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
He's more than fortunate
to be living in this world.

129
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,760
What nonsense are you babbling?!

130
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
If you don't believe me,

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
ask that phony son of yours.

132
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
You sure inherited that revolting nature
from your ancestors.

133
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,600
Did you never want our sons
to get married,

134
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,080
so you came up with that scheme
to ruin their wedding?!

135
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Good!

136
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,920
If that's the case, I'll consider

137
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,760
Suriya and Apo's marriage
as if it never happened.

138
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
And there will never be
another marriage

139
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
between the two families!

140
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
Fine!

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,960
This wouldn't have taken so long
if you'd spoken up!

142
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
From now on,

143
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,600
the Yue family

144
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
and the Suriyadechakorns

145
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,840
are through!

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll have a word with him.

147
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,320
If you continue to be this stubborn,

148
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,280
eventually,

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
you will have no one left by your side.

150
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,200
Any luck in contacting those two?

151
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,360
Are you worried about Apo?

152
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,600
Mm.

153
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Wait...

154
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,560
I mean, only as a friend.

155
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Do you still think I'm into him?

156
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,800
Why the sad face?

157
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm not.

158
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm not sad.

159
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
I don't know how they're doing,

160
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,480
but I'm sure

161
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,720
that M.R. Ya
will take the best care of Apo.

162
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,720
Now, I'm more worried about my family.

163
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,360
It's like a war.

164
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,480
Ever since that happened,

165
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,720
Father has been taking it out on us,

166
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,360
so the vibe is totally off.

167
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,960
Also, Mother is now
giving him the cold shoulder.

168
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,000
As for Daonuer,
he cried for no one but M.R. Ya.

169
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Then,

170
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,640
should we put out the fire
with something cold?

171
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
Wait here. I'll be back.

172
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Here,

173
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,600
your favorite ice cream flavor.

174
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,640
You remember that?

175
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
It's not that hard.

176
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,520
You're pretty attentive, aren't you?

177
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Are you gonna take it?

178
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,160
Look at you

179
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,560
saying that my eyes widen
when I eat something good.

180
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,800
You also act like a kid
when you have it.

181
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,320
Well, I can't help that it's good.

182
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,560
Look over here.

183
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,320
This way?

184
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
This way!

185
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,840
You make a mess like a kid, too.

186
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,080
All of a sudden,
why do I wanna kiss you?

187
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,200
Hey...

188
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,120
You do realize...

189
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,240
that I can still read your mind
when we touch, right?

190
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,200
Mm.

191
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:10,680
♫When this planet and the moon entwine♫

192
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:19,680
♫It feels like our paths perfectly align♫

193
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,960
♫To make this night a thing of beauty♫

194
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
♫Tonight, with just our gaze,♫

195
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:42,040
♫It's clear that we're in love♫

196
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,960
Aren't you gonna eat your ice cream?

197
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
It's gonna melt, you know?

198
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,360
Do you know what I'm thinking?

199
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,240
You don't wanna
cut the lawn anymore, right?

200
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,800
You sure know a lot,
you naughty one.

201
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Whoa, Ya!

202
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,280
Actually, I'm thinking that...

203
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,000
once we save up some money,

204
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,440
we'll have our wedding here again...

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
right by this beach.

206
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
See that area over there?

207
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,240
That's where the table
for our wedding souvenirs will be.

208
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
Next to that,

209
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,520
there'll be a beautiful display
of our photos

210
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,440
to welcome the guests.

211
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,080
And where we're standing now

212
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,760
is where the altar will be

213
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,280
for our vows.

214
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
It's gonna be simple

215
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,720
and surrounded by
the people we love.

216
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,440
That's going to be perfect.

217
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
For you...

218
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,800
Does all that...

219
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
really sound perfect?

220
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
It sure is,

221
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,720
with you right next to me.

222
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,320
- Let's go.
- Hm?

223
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Where are we going?

224
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,840
- Oh, Yi.
- Mother?

225
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,120
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

226
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,320
How has it been, Mother?

227
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,240
Has anyone gotten a hold of Ya?

228
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,680
It's all because of Apo.

229
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,560
I never thought he'd be
such a bad influence on Ya.

230
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,800
It has nothing to do with Apo, dear.

231
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,440
All this time,

232
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,960
I might've just misjudged them.

233
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,040
They genuinely love each other.

234
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,160
Mother...

235
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Yi, my dear,

236
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,600
it's all my fault.

237
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm really sorry

238
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,000
for dragging you into this.

239
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,560
From now on,

240
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,560
I will give you back your freedom.

241
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,000
You can move on now, dear.

242
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,720
I'm happy

243
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,200
that Ya has found someone he loves

244
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,960
and who truly loves him back.

245
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Yi...

246
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,680
I need to thank you...

247
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,520
for once making Ya happy.

248
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,560
Uh...

249
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
So,

250
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,280
is Father upstairs, Mother?

251
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,640
I was planning on visiting him, too.

252
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,400
He is.

253
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
At his office.

254
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,920
- Right, please excuse me, then.
- Of course.

255
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,200
You all know
I'm in search of a new Dragon's Belly.

256
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
Stuff like this takes time.

257
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,240
But our time is money.

258
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,960
The land hasn't been found yet,

259
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,720
and now there's a scandal.

260
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,520
I guess I have to say goodbye.

261
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,680
Would you mind a quick talk, Father?

262
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,320
Come in.

263
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,840
Are you stressed
about the Dragon's Belly?

264
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,280
Have a seat.

265
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,640
Thank you.

266
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
So...

267
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,920
I heard that...

268
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,960
after Ya released a statement
about not buying the land,

269
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,000
Siao Tawan's partners have been
finding ways to break the deal.

270
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
My son is such a good-for-nothing.

271
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,000
Suddenly, he gave in
and acted like a saint.

272
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
Even if we don't buy it,

273
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,680
someone else will go after it anyway.

274
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,800
You're right about that.

275
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,520
If it were me,

276
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,400
I'd take that chance to improve
Siao Tawan Group's image.

277
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,400
I'd put the money I earned
from the hotel business

278
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,280
into a fund to support orphanages
across the country,

279
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
instead of...

280
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,560
just saying no one will touch the land.

281
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm not saying this to put Ya down,

282
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,400
but I just thought...

283
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,800
this was how it was meant to be.

284
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
You seem to have a good understanding
of management and investment.

285
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,000
It would've been great
if you were still with Ya.

286
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,400
Did you two break up

287
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
because my son was a good-for-nothing?

288
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,680
Uh...

289
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
No, Father.

290
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,840
We...

291
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,560
We were forced to break up

292
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,080
because Ya had to get engaged with Apo.

293
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Maybe I was wrong all this time.

294
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,760
The person who deserves
to be Ya's life partner,

295
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,840
is someone who toughens him up,

296
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
not someone who makes him weak.

297
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,040
And I really think that person is you.

298
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,280
Can you turn Suriya
into his old self, Yi?

299
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,400
Definitely.

300
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,600
I promise I will bring Ya

301
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,000
back into the Suriyadechakorn family.

302
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,080
Thank you so much.

303
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,160
Should he come back,

304
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll reconsider the marriage.

305
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,200
Ya should only marry someone
who deserves him.

306
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,360
Thank you.

307
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,200
Milady!

308
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,720
Milady! Milady!

309
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,280
Anyone, please call an ambulance!

310
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
- Milady...
- Milady!

311
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,560
Milady!

312
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,880
Is anyone around? Call an ambulance!

313
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,880
Milady!

314
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,240
Milady, are you alright?

315
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
Pick up the phone, Ya...

316
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,440
Doctor...

317
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,240
Uncle,

318
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,680
how is Mother doing?

319
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
She's out of critical condition.

320
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Luckily, she got here just in time.

321
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,640
Thank you so much, Uncle.

322
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't mention it.

323
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,400
For someone this important
to my nephew,

324
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,000
of course, I had to call
the best medical team.

325
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,800
Was it because of...

326
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,760
her heart disease?

327
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
It was.

328
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
Her relapse was due in part
to accumulated fatigue.

329
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,440
Now, please excuse me.

330
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,800
Wait...

331
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,400
How long has she had heart disease?

332
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,560
Father...

333
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,600
Please sit down for now.

334
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,840
Still haven't gotten a hold of Ya?

335
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,400
Butler Francois...

336
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
I need your help.

337
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,520
Ya!

338
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,880
I'm back!

339
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,240
Wow!

340
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,520
Whoa! What do we have here?

341
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Lady Pripprao's signature chicken soup.

342
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,040
Wow...

343
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,400
Mm, that smells good!

344
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Isn't it?

345
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,880
Wanna take a bite?

346
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,360
Wonder if it could compare
to your mother's cooking...

347
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,880
Wait...

348
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,880
Is that phone still working?

349
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,440
Your Excellency.

350
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,200
Francois?

351
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,440
That'd be me.

352
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Your family passed on the message that

353
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
Lady Pripprao had a relapse
of her heart disease.

354
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,200
She's now hospitalized.

355
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,560
How is she doing now?

356
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,120
She's safe now

357
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,520
and in the recovery room.

358
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,120
Okay...

359
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,200
Then, please take care
of her on my behalf,

360
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,440
and call me to keep me posted.

361
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Ya.

362
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't have the heart to see Mother.

363
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,080
I'm the reason she ended up like this.

364
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,240
I deserve to be out of the family.

365
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
No matter what,

366
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,600
they are still your family.

367
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,000
They need you

368
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
as much as you need them.

369
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,840
I didn't want to leave my family either.

370
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,600
Hello, Francois?

371
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Yes, Your Excellency?

372
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,040
The cell reception is quite poor.

373
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,640
Can you hear me?

374
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,760
Send a helicopter.

375
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll send you my location.

376
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,800
Uh, Your Excellency.

377
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Right now, we're facing
a devastating storm.

378
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,040
It would be impossible at the moment.

379
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
We need our car.

380
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
[Pripprao Suriyadechakorn: NPO]

381
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,040
How come you never told me

382
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
that you have been ill?

383
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,760
It's not that
she didn't want to tell you.

384
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,440
You were just never there for her.

385
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,680
Ironic, isn't it?

386
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,000
We might be able to read anyone's mind,

387
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
but with the people closest to us,

388
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,480
we never really know them
inside and out.

389
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
Because of this ability,

390
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,240
I know how selfish
every single soul in this world is.

391
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,600
I don't wish for my successor

392
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,680
to be frail

393
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,720
and easily shaken.

394
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,360
And how does loving someone

395
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,360
make us frail?

396
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,680
What if the legacy we're passing

397
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
forces them to marry
someone they don't love?

398
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,360
Am I next in line?

399
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,320
I've found someone I love,

400
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
and I won't accept losing him.

401
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
And in case you haven't realized yet,

402
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,560
Ya ran away

403
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,400
because you tried to
take the person he loves from him.

404
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,560
Sir, can I borrow the car?

405
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
It's an emergency.

406
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,800
Please.

407
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
You can have this,

408
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,600
and I'll return the car, too.

409
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Thank you, sir.

410
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,400
Come on!

411
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,240
Hey...

412
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,120
Hm?

413
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,200
Are you okay?

414
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
I am.

415
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,560
Hey, Ashin.

416
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,720
What's up?

417
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,920
Where are you and Apo?

418
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,520
I know who's behind Apo's accident.

419
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,880
Darling...

420
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,680
Milady...

421
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,360
Milady!

422
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,320
Milady!

423
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,720
What's the matter with you?

424
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,680
And what are these?

425
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,480
Why are there
so many flowers everywhere?

426
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,120
I even thought
I woke up in a flower shop.

427
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,640
I...

428
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,680
I didn't know which flowers you liked,

429
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,920
so I bought everything.

430
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,280
All this time,

431
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,760
I have never once
cared for you properly.

432
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,560
Can we start over, please?

433
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,600
Please?

434
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,000
A lotus?

435
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,480
Do I remind you of the Buddha?

436
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,480
Milady...

437
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,560
For all this time,

438
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,720
our marriage might have felt
like we were just strangers.

439
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,400
But when I realized...

440
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,360
I might lose you,

441
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
I...

442
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,440
I finally understood

443
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,240
what it feels like...

444
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
to...

445
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,440
lose someone you love.

446
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,080
Darling...

447
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,680
Please, just...

448
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
give me another chance.

449
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,920
Next time,

450
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
could you give me a rose?

451
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Sure, sure.

452
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Of course.

453
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,600
But the lotus is quite a beauty, right?

454
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,200
Mother, are you awake?

455
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
My dear Yi.

456
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,560
Thank you for coming to visit.

457
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,880
May I examine you?

458
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,200
Please do.

459
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Excuse me.

460
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,240
Uh...

461
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,680
Yi?

462
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,680
Yes?

463
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,040
May I talk with you?

464
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,680
Sure.

465
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,320
Yes, Father?

466
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,560
What do you want to talk about?

467
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,600
About the deal I made with you earlier...

468
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,320
I've thought it over.

469
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,920
I apologize

470
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,360
for saying such things.

471
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,440
What is this, Father?

472
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,320
Why are you suddenly
going back on your word?

473
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,160
It's my fault

474
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,440
for insisting on changing my course.

475
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,360
But now, I think it's time

476
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,040
to let my son decide
what makes him happy.

477
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,480
But, Father...

478
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,920
I really do love Ya.

479
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,000
I can even help him

480
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,680
when it comes to Siao Tawan Group.

481
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,320
Please trust me, Father.

482
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,760
But when it comes to his feelings...

483
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,560
I can't take control of them.

484
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,040
You gave me a f*cking false hope

485
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,200
and suddenly broke your own damn word?

486
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Father, can you please reconsider?

487
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,280
Yi...

488
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,960
Do you really love him that much?

489
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,960
Yes,

490
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,560
I love him more than you can imagine.

491
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,040
So much so that I thought
about getting rid of Apo.

492
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,280
Too bad that bastard survived
and turned into a thorn in my side.

493
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,400
Apo's accident...

494
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,200
You were behind it, were you?

495
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,480
Wait...

496
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,680
How the hell does His Serene Highness
know about the accident?

497
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
What do you mean?

498
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,600
You hit Apo
with that car, didn't you?

499
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,920
You were the one
who hit Apo with that car, right?!

500
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Weren't you?!

501
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,200
Answer me!

502
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,200
Weren't you?

503
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,240
- Weren't you?!
- Ugh!

504
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
How on earth
would I hit him with a car?!

505
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Damn you...

506
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,400
Why is he suspicious about the accident?

507
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,320
Did he know something?

508
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,360
Oh, Apo?

509
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
What brought you here?

510
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,800
Whatever brought you here,

511
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,280
I hope it leads you back
to where you belong.

512
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,400
Hold up, Apo.

513
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm just here to apologize to Ya.

514
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,880
Others might fall for your little act,

515
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,040
but I can see right through you.

516
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,440
You're here to take Ya back.

517
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,800
It's not what you think.

518
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,320
I just haven't seen Ya for so long.

519
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,520
Since he's back,

520
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
I thought I should meet up with him.

521
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Really?

522
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,400
Mm.

523
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
One more thing...

524
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,680
I don't think

525
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,760
Ya will ever want to see you again.

526
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
I know

527
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,040
your breakup wasn't
because of the long distance,

528
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,920
but...

529
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,040
because of your affair.

530
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Am I right?

531
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Thirsty?

532
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,480
Let me tell you something.

533
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,280
Even though he wasn't engaged to me,

534
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,960
he would never go back to you.

535
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,040
Now, leave Ya alone.

536
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,760
It pisses me off.

537
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
Hi, there.

538
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,600
Are you sure, Ashin?

539
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
Yi did it?

540
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,920
I am.

541
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,640
Francois and I
just got the new evidence.

542
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,800
I called the police
to bust him right at the hospital.

543
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,840
M.R. Ya!

544
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,320
Oh.

545
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,840
How are you holding up?

546
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm okay.

547
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,480
Well, how's Mother doing?

548
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,880
Who's with her right now?

549
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,080
Just Father?

550
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,320
I saw...

551
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,960
Yi stopped by this morning.

552
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,480
What?

553
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
Hey!

554
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,680
M.R. Ya.

555
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
What's happening?

556
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,920
Yi is the one behind Apo's accident?

557
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,080
Yeah, I wish it wasn't true.

558
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Father.

559
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,240
Where's Mother?

560
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,120
Yi's probably taken her somewhere now.

561
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,560
I'll take care of that.

562
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,800
- As for you...
- The nurse went to get the doctor.

563
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
Go after them!

564
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,280
Yes.

565
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,440
- Chan, get me the car.
- Yes?

566
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,200
I'll go down and talk to the police.

567
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,960
Okay...

568
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,520
That's the car, officer!

569
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,160
The suspect has taken the hostage
to Highway 8!

570
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
M.R. Ya, get in the car.

571
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,760
Chan, go take care of Father,

572
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,040
and keep an eye on Apo.

573
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,400
I'll take the car.

574
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
I'm coming with you.

575
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,400
Hey, Apo!

576
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,280
You can't. It's too dangerous.

577
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Stay here.

578
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
It's okay.

579
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,720
He's gonna be fine.

580
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,720
Come on, Apo.

581
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,640
- Chan, take care of Father.
- Apo!

582
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,520
Yi...

583
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,600
Don't do this, my dear.

584
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,760
Yi...

585
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,880
We can talk.

586
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,760
Yi, this is not gonna end well.

587
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,840
Yi, don't do...

588
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,960
Shut the f*ck up!

589
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,040
[Y MART: 500 meters ahead]

590
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,040
This street's exactly like
the one in the other world.

591
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
If I keep going, I'll see Soi 7,

592
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,560
and Y MART will be at its entrance.

593
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,640
Is it in reverse?

594
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,880
From the route he took to escape,

595
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,280
he'll come this way for sure.

596
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,720
Phopthorn!

597
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,520
Hey...

598
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,200
Are you okay, Thorn?!

599
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,240
Thorn!

600
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,920
Thorn!

601
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,040
Where am I?

602
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Ya!

603
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Tor...

604
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,400
Tai!

605
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Papa...

606
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Mama!

607
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,400
Ashin.

608
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Ya!

609
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,000
Hi...

610
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,760
Hello,

611
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,080
Apo in disguise.

612
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Apo...

613
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,520
Thorn!

614
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,560
Thorn!

615
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
Doctor! Doctor!

616
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,760
Can you come over here?

617
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,760
How's it feel,

618
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,680
stealing my fancy life

619
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,400
and my fiancé?

620
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
Are you enjoying this life?

621
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,480
Too bad...

622
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,760
Your time is up,

623
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Phopthorn.

624
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,240
I'm taking back what's mine.

625
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Apo...

626
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,360
I never meant to steal your life.

627
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,640
If you want it back now,

628
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,200
I'll return it to you.

629
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
But...

630
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,840
can I just have a moment
to say goodbye?

631
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,520
Getting hooked?

632
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,760
The real one is back,

633
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,600
so step back, you phony.

634
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,960
But...

635
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,240
I promised Ya

636
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,800
that I'd be right by his side.

637
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Back off.

638
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,040
I'm going back to my body.

639
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,720
Thorn!

640
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,160
Thorn, no!

641
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,760
Sir, please step aside.

642
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Wake up, Thorn!

643
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,560
- Thorn!
- Please take a step back.

644
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,760
Don't leave me, Thorn!

645
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,320
Charge it to 50 joules.

646
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,320
For the second shock,
charge it to 100 joules.

647
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,480
Apo!

648
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,640
Apo, I'm begging you!

649
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,320
I've never asked
for anything in my entire life,

650
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,240
but can I have a moment
to say goodbye?

651
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,960
Just let me see Ya for the last time,

652
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,320
that's all I'm asking for.

653
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,280
I don't want to just disappear

654
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,880
and leave him with sadness.

655
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,600
I just want to say my last goodbye.

656
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,360
I want him to know

657
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,640
why I have to leave,

658
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,560
and I want to tell him
to keep living his life,

659
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,720
even if I can't be with him anymore.

660
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,800
After all this time living in your body,

661
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,080
I know all too well

662
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,160
that I'm just a disguise,

663
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,400
and when the moment comes,

664
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,880
I have to give everything back
to the real one.

665
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,720
So,

666
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,800
don't you worry.

667
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,640
I'm not going to steal your perfect life.

668
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,040
I promise...

669
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,960
that once I say goodbye to Ya,

670
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,160
I will return what's yours, Apo.

671
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,200
Ugh!

672
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,720
Sike.

673
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
What do you mean?

674
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,360
I was gonna mess with you
a little longer,

675
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,880
but...

676
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,600
it gives me such an ick

677
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,240
seeing myself this desperate.

678
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,440
You're...

679
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,120
not here to get your life back?

680
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,160
I wanted to.

681
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,560
But after all this time,

682
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
I realize...

683
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,400
how good you are as Apo in disguise.

684
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,720
You're so good that...

685
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,800
the real one, like me, feels ashamed.

686
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,120
You helped the Yue family
reconcile again.

687
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,320
When I was there,

688
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
I argued with Ashin every day.

689
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,400
I barely ever saw
Papa and Mama as happy

690
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,240
or laughing

691
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,760
as much as they do
when they're with you.

692
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,640
You also take great care of Ya.

693
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,880
And most importantly,

694
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,120
you love him,

695
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,440
and he loves you.

696
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,040
From now on,

697
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,960
you've gotta stop thinking

698
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,360
you're Apo in disguise.

699
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,400
From this moment on,

700
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,120
you're the real Apo.

701
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Keep that in mind.

702
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,960
What about you?

703
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,640
If I'm living your life,

704
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,360
then what about you?

705
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,000
I found a place where I belong,

706
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,840
and someone who sees me
as the real one.

707
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,800
I have one last wish to ask of you.

708
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,880
Can you continue being Apo

709
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,000
for Papa and Mama?

710
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,480
I just don't want them to be sad

711
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,600
if they know I'm gone.

712
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
I promise.

713
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,040
It's time for me to go.

714
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,080
Nice to meet you,

715
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,680
Apo in disguise.

716
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,400
Right,

717
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,040
one more thing.

718
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,680
I know you like sour curry,

719
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,720
but it's not like
you have to eat it so often.

720
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,400
I hate climbing wattles.

721
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,440
What vegetable on earth

722
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
is that so stinky?

723
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,480
Take care of my family and Ya for me,

724
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,320
and live my life to the fullest,

725
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Phopthorn.

726
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,200
Nurse, charge it to 150 joules.

727
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,480
Doctor!

728
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,160
He's stable now.

729
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
Thorn...

730
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,160
Come back to me...

731
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,240
Don't leave me.

732
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,680
I'm right here, Thorn.

733
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,600
Ya!

734
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,280
Ya!

735
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,080
Ya, can you hear me?

736
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,640
Ya!

737
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,360
Phopthorn!

738
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,360
Master.

739
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,520
Follow the voice of your beloved,

740
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,560
and you will get another chance at life.

741
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,520
Come back to me...

742
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,960
Thorn!

743
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,320
Thorn, are you finally awake?

744
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,640
Thorn!

745
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,000
I thought you were never coming back.

746
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,320
I told you

747
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,480
I'd be right by your side.

748
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,240
I'm not going anywhere now.

749
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,640
Plus,

750
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,640
I promised Apo

751
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,200
that I'd take good care of you.

752
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,120
Apo!

753
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,680
- My dear!
- Apo!

754
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,600
Po!

755
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,160
- Goodness...
- My dear son...

756
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,520
Are you finally awake?

757
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,000
Are you awake, dear?

758
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,800
Po is awake!

759
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,040
Are you saying

760
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
you met the real Apo?

761
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,800
Yes.

762
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,720
The curtain has fallen on an elite
whose name begins with Y,

763
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,640
the suspect in a hit-and-run case,

764
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,400
after he was involved in an accident
while fleeing from the police.

765
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,960
First responders rushed him
to the hospital,

766
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,720
where a medical team provided
the best possible care,

767
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,640
but he later died.

768
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,240
Here you go.

769
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,520
Welcome home,

770
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,640
Phopthorn.

771
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,840
I apologize for what happened!

772
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,960
You can blame it all on me.

773
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,160
Come on,

774
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,240
I don't hold a grudge
against you anymore.

775
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,320
There's really no need
for such formal apologies.

776
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,680
Hm, it seems that

777
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,480
the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree!

778
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,800
How long are you going to
keep standing?

779
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,320
Aren't you eating?

780
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,880
Sit down.

781
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,520
Just sit down.

782
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,840
Please enjoy the meal.

783
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
Apo,

784
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,560
I apologize

785
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,680
for saying those horrible things.

786
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,280
Oh, it's all good.

787
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,400
I actually kinda forgot them now.

788
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,960
Good, good.

789
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,160
I don't know

790
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,160
what His Serene Highness
meant the other day,

791
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,880
nor do I know

792
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,720
if you're the real Apo.

793
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,560
But all the happiness
your mama and I

794
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,640
get from this Apo

795
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,640
is never phony.

796
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Papa...

797
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,280
Come what may,

798
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,960
you're our son

799
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,560
and Ashin's little brother.

800
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Mama.

801
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
Let me join.

802
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,400
Ashin, come here!

803
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,520
You guys are so dramatic.

804
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,600
Ashin, come here.

805
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,920
I'm full.

806
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,560
Thank you
for inviting me out for a meal.

807
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Mm. No problem.

808
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,280
"Super Moon: The Moon-Viewing Festival."

809
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,680
Are you secretly
asking me out on a date?

810
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,680
What?

811
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,920
What have we been doing all this time?

812
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,560
I guess those weren't dates,

813
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,600
just two guys hanging out.

814
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,880
So are you free this Friday?

815
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,960
Uh...

816
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,040
I...

817
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,280
I have a gig at Siao Tawan Bar.

818
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,960
What about next time?

819
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,160
It's gonna be a long wait, then.

820
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,240
I'm sorry...

821
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,840
How about

822
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,000
we...

823
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,640
do something else later?

824
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,880
Mm, fine.

825
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,880
Here.

826
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,960
Then...

827
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,800
I'm going upstairs now.

828
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,040
Well...

829
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,920
Drive home safely, alright?

830
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,040
Okay.

831
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,400
Bye-bye.

832
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,560
Uh...

833
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,480
Bye-bye.

834
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,720
Well, are you free tonight?

835
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
Uh...

836
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,160
So...

837
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,480
Do you wanna...

838
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,840
gaze at the moon at my place?

839
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,240
Take a seat.

840
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,840
I'll show you something cool.

841
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,280
- Okay
- Mm.

842
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,240
It's too bad there's no Super Moon.

843
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,400
Uh...

844
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,360
There.

845
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
It's still not as big.

846
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,640
I'm sorry.

847
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,560
It's fine.

848
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,160
Do you know

849
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,600
what a Super Moon is?

850
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
I don't.

851
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,360
A Super Moon happens

852
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,480
when the Moon is at its closest point

853
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,240
to the Earth in its orbit.

854
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,360
I don't want to say it out loud,

855
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,840
but I'll let you read my mind

856
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,160
because there's something
I want you to know.

857
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,640
So...

858
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,840
I think...

859
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,520
I've fallen for you.

860
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,880
I've fallen for you, too, Tailah.

861
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,080
I've fallen so hard.

862
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,320
You mean the world to me.

863
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,440
- Go ahead and scatter all the petals.
- Go on.

864
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,520
Thank you.

865
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,760
I vow to you, the person
right in front of me,

866
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,280
that I will forever be by your side.

867
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,600
The reason I love you
is not about who you are,

868
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,040
but rather

869
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,000
the person I become when I'm with you.

870
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,560
I thought I was a workaholic

871
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,120
who didn't need love,

872
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,000
someone who never had to
give his heart to anyone.

873
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,240
But that wasn't me at all.

874
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,880
Thank you for introducing me
to the real Suriya.

875
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,120
Thank you for being in my life

876
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,520
and changing my whole world.

877
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,240
I love you.

878
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,360
Thank you

879
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,400
for loving me for who I really am,

880
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,400
and for giving me

881
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,840
a reason to live in this world.

882
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,480
Meeting you is the biggest gift
I could ever ask for.

883
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,200
I promise

884
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,280
that whenever you're stressed,

885
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,520
I'll be there to ease them.

886
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:17,760
And whenever you decide to go on
some tall, scary ride,

887
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,960
or you've got something on your mind,

888
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,000
I promise

889
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,520
I'll be right there beside you.

890
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,240
I'll be your real one, forever.

891
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,320
Ready?

892
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,520
It's coming!

893
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,560
Hey!

894
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,640
Do you guys want to take over the altar?

895
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,840
What do you say?

896
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,680
Just tie another knot!

897
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,920
- Yeah!
- Tie the knot.

898
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,120
- Tie the knot!
- Tie the knot!

899
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,080
- Go on, tie the knot!
- Tie the knot!

900
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,680
♫Pretending to be someone else
is breaking me♫

901
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,680
♫All I want is to be myself, you see♫

902
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,840
♫Neither sweet nor deep♫

903
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:54,800
♫I don't want to be like others,
putting on a charade♫

904
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,920
♫Can I just be myself
when I'm in your arms,♫

905
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,680
♫Being who I truly am?♫

906
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,000
I love you, Thorn.

907
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,840
I love you, too, Ya.

908
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,600
What?

909
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,680
We kissed way too much today.

910
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,120
Go!

911
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,560
For this...

912
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,400
I'll let you win.

913
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,120
Ya...

914
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,680
Don't...

915
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,040
Don't kiss me there...

916
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,280
You know this is my sensitive area...

917
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,840
Your kiss...

918
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,840
There's nothing I love
more than your kiss.

919
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,200
Where do you like it?

920
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,800
Ya...

921
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,440
Where are your lips going?

922
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,080
Don't tease me.

923
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,680
Stop it...

924
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,840
or else...

925
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,160
I won't be able to handle it.
