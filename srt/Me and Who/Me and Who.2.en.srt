Even though I've never been

I'm not all that naive or anything.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,360
Thank you, Ya.

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Have a good night.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Hey...

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Huh?

14
00:00:58,353 --> 00:00:59,675
So realistic

15
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:02,233
that we have to share
a real goodbye kiss?

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,200
Alright, fine.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,680
Muah, muah, muah...

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
You're delusional.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,440
I was just gonna tell you
something important about my family.

20
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,840
All the men in my family

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
can read minds.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,200
Huh?!

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,280
Wait, so that means...

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,680
I can't look anyone in the eye!

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,440
Ugh, please!

26
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,560
Do you realize how hard it is
to avoid everyone's eyes?

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,120
I can't even avoid
your gaze these days,

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,520
so how could I even avoid eye contact
of all the men in your family?

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,440
As long as you wear this necklace,

30
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,920
no one can read your mind,

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,680
except when they touch you on your skin.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Like this.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
I won't be able to read your mind.

34
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:45,815
What...

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,960
- What are you doing?!
- "What are you doing?!"

36
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,680
I'm making sure you know

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
that if I touch your skin like this,

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,160
I will be able to read your mind.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And why is my heart racing this badly?

40
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,360
Is it the necklace?

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,800
Thank you, Ya.

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Have a good night.

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,880
Hey...

44
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,460
Apo!

45
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Long time no see.

46
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
How are you doing?

47
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,473
If you see one
that's unusually friendly,

48
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,770
that would be Chanjak,
my younger brother.

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
He's cunning,

50
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
and always ready to tease Apo.

51
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,680
Most of the time,
Apo will be the one getting fed up

52
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,020
and staying away from him.

53
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,960
Hello!

54
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,046
Hello...

55
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,420
Apo...

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,400
you...seem different today.

57
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
Uh...

58
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
Different how?

59
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,950
He was simply saying hi.

60
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,800
I don't know.

61
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,620
I just know he seems different today.

62
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,966
You're imagining things, Chan.

63
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,360
Wait,

64
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,720
is it the new hairstyle

65
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,200
that makes you cuter?

66
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,880
Hey...

67
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
- Argh!
- Whoa!

68
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,908
Argh!

69
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,140
As for Daonuer,
the youngest brother of my family,

70
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,226
you can be at ease

71
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:10,071
because his ability hasn't awakened.

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,760
Um, are you alright?

73
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,000
Give me my penguin plushie, or else...

74
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,600
You didn't have it with you?!

75
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,802
Bang!

76
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,200
That's so skibidi!

77
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,150
- There, come here.
- "Skibidi"?

78
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
It's alright.

79
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,970
I'll bring it to you next time.

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Milady,

81
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Mr. Apo has arrived.

82
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,620
But he seems polite today,

83
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,640
looking like a kind young master.

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,920
Plus, he seems to be really close
with His Excellency!

85
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,680
Huh.

86
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,200
No amount of pretending
is going to cover it all!

87
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,360
I will be the one busting him!

88
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
Little Ari,

89
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,080
have you got everything prepared?

90
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Yes, Madam.

91
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:30,353
Today's final boss
is going to be my mother,

92
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:32,960
'Lady Pripprao.'

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
Huh?!

94
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,460
She's even more capable
than mind reading?!

95
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
No,

96
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,665
she never knows about this ability.

97
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:42,443
You don't have
to be concerned about that;

98
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:44,188
you just have to win her heart.

99
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,360
Hasn't the water been served yet?

100
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,280
The guests must be absolutely furious.

101
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,870
Excuse me.

102
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
Oops!

103
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,200
- Oh, my goodness!!
- Oh!

104
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
You're all soaked!

105
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,320
Goodness, what should we do?!

106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,960
Are you gonna fire her
like you did the last maid?!

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Alas!

108
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,480
My deepest apologies. I didn't mean to!

109
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,120
I really am sorry!

110
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,240
It's completely fine.

111
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I'll...

112
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
I'll just pat it dry.

113
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:33,080
Huh?

114
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,680
Sorry...

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,600
Alright.

116
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Please.

117
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,200
It's Thai food
with such a savory taste.

118
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
First, it's the sourness,

119
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:14,880
accompanied by the spiciness,

120
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
sweetness,

121
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,120
and saltiness.

122
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,684
The taste is familiar, but...

123
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,720
I can't quite put my finger on it.

124
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
Sour curry.

125
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
That's right.

126
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
That's Ari's special sour curry,

127
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,200
served as a deconstructed dish.

128
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,520
The soup has been transformed
into a granita,

129
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,320
while the fried egg with climbing wattle
has been turned into gels.

130
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,280
As for the shrimps,
I blended them into mousses

131
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,120
before using
molecular gastronomy techniques

132
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,760
- and...
- I think that's quite enough, Ari.

133
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,120
Everybody now knows
how good a chef you are!

134
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,001
Oh, but earlier,

135
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,640
Ya himself was quite impressive

136
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,395
for recognizing
his ex-girlfriend's cooking!

137
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,200
An ex back in kindergarten, too.

138
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,320
Here,

139
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,240
what happened was

140
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,720
I paid a visit
to Little Ari's house the other day,

141
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
and she made me this dish.

142
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I honestly couldn't get enough of it,

143
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,554
so I wanted everyone to have a taste!

144
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,800
Look, you can say otherwise,

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,060
but anyone
who becomes Little Ari's partner

146
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,960
is truly enviable!

147
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,720
Who in the world

148
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,560
could be this beautiful
and this good at cooking?

149
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Anyone who gets to make her
their daughter-in-law

150
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,640
is blessed for life!

151
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,680
Am I right, Ya?

152
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes,

153
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,358
anyone would be blessed
if they have a partner who can cook,

154
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,400
but I'm fine either way

155
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,280
because we have maids.

156
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,160
Uh, but I still think

157
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,440
it's better to have basic skills.

158
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,260
Even just half of what Ari can do

159
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,440
would put me at ease.

160
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
Isn't that right, Apo?

161
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,077
Right?

162
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,960
You old impudent hag!

163
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,880
What nonsense are you babbling?!

164
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,320
Apo!

165
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,600
How could you say that to my mother?!

166
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,520
Do you have to be so despicable?!

167
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,913
Your mother

168
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,480
is deliberately provoking me!!

169
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,153
Hey!

170
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:54,953
If you like
the housewife type that much,

171
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:58,720
why didn't you just go and marry
your little perfect housewife Ari?!

172
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,473
Apo!!

173
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,080
I'm at my limit!!

174
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
You have no right
to talk to her that way!

175
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
You and I are done!!

176
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,160
- Dump his ass!
- Ya!

177
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,280
That's offensive!!

178
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,640
Get out!!

179
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
As for my mother,

180
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,840
you can try
behaving normally around her.

181
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,200
Maybe she'll like you the way you are.

182
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Then,

183
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,520
would you allow me
to make you a meal today?

184
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,800
Come on,

185
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
I'll put on your apron for you,

186
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,320
baby.

187
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
All done.

188
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,280
Thank you.

189
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,880
What are they cooking, bro?

190
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,960
I don't have a clue,

191
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,360
but...

192
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
it smells divine.

193
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,520
I heard that Apo is the cook,

194
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,880
so I rushed home
right after my business is done.

195
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,873
As for my father, M.C. Jakkawarn,

196
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,760
he is not hard to win over.

197
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,600
Then, I'll serve it to you
right away, Your Serene Highness.

198
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,680
Please do!

199
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,560
It looks really plain.

200
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,040
I'd say the taste
is also no match to Ari's.

201
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,466
It's better than Ari's!

202
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
It tastes good...

203
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,560
but a little too spicy!

204
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,040
Though, I'd say this is rich.

205
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,280
But people who dislike spicy food

206
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,520
could never handle this!

207
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,840
Well, it's...

208
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
Overall, she's saying it's delectable.

209
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,680
Let's see.

210
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,480
Let me try.

211
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,099
Even though it's easy to win his heart,

212
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,453
the hard part...

213
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,166
Thank you...

214
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,716
is that he is the king of mind readers!

215
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,520
Even if there's something in the way,

216
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,034
- he can still read your mind!
- so much!

217
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,840
Enjoy your meal, sir!

218
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,280
What a dork.

219
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
I like it!

220
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,190
Yas!

221
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,160
Survived the meal without a scratch!

222
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,130
No one was able to touch me!

223
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,320
Game over.

224
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,680
Has Apo really changed?

225
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,840
The same goes for Ya,

226
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,280
why is he into that kid
all of a sudden?!

227
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,600
There's something
suspicious between these two...

228
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,640
Or is it that...

229
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,360
Apo tricked my son into marrying him

230
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,720
using his family's business?!

231
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,800
Ugh!

232
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I won't let my son
marry the person he's not into.

233
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,840
Code red.

234
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,800
Honestly,

235
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,120
you didn't have to cook
to appease anyone.

236
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,600
Mother was just trying to provoke you.

237
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,280
You could've just listened
until she was done.

238
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,840
You told me yourself

239
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,120
that Apo was madly in love with you,

240
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,380
so how could I just sit there

241
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,040
listening to her praising someone else

242
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,920
for being a better fit for you?

243
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,440
Uh...

244
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
I meant,

245
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,920
I was thinking on behalf of Apo.

246
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,880
I don't mind
if those were your own feelings.

247
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just kidding.

248
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
It was a joke.

249
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
Try making that joke again,

250
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,280
and I'll take it seriously.

251
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,040
Just kidding.

252
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,520
In all honesty,

253
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,360
I never knew
you were this good at cooking.

254
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,640
Gosh,

255
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,920
cooking, serving, providing services,

256
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,080
you name it, I do it all.

257
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,400
You won't believe
how many part-time jobs I took

258
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,680
when I was in the other world.

259
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,920
If there are 24 hours in a day,

260
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,960
I probably work 48!

261
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,800
I never have time
to enjoy life like other people.

262
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,540
But I really enjoyed it today.

263
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
What about you?

264
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,380
Do you enjoy being with me?

265
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
M.R. Ya!

266
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
- My baby Ya!
- Yes, baby?

267
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,240
Do you want more sour curry today?

268
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,480
You mean your delicious sour curry?

269
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,560
Oh!

270
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,890
My bad

271
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,080
for interrupting your romantic time.

272
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,080
What's up?

273
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Father and Mother
need to have a word with you.

274
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
Wanna come?

275
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,560
Alright.

276
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,160
Huh?

277
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,480
You want me to move in with Ya
before the engagement ceremony, Mother?

278
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Um...

279
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Is that a good idea?

280
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,840
The Lady herself
was the one proposing this.

281
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,000
A youngster like you
wouldn't mind, right, Apo?

282
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,960
Consider it a trial run
for your relationship.

283
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,320
In case you guys don't make it,

284
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,900
we won't need
a press conference about your divorce

285
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,880
to humiliate ourselves
in front of everyone.

286
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:09,104
Uh...

287
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,480
But...

288
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,520
is this gonna be
too much trouble for Ya?

289
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,040
Plus, I don't think

290
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,880
Papa and Mama
would approve of this idea.

291
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,360
I'm feeling my heart sink

292
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
as you won't be living
in this house anymore.

293
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,960
That's you feeling your heart sink?

294
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,360
Don't interrupt people

295
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
when they are having their moment.

296
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,280
But no matter how bad it feels,

297
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm worry-free.

298
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,800
All this time, I forced you
into marrying His Excellency

299
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,960
because I want someone decent

300
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,000
to take care of you in my place.

301
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,440
Everything His Excellency has been doing

302
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,800
assures your father and me

303
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,540
that we have got the right one.

304
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,800
No matter what,
take good care of yourself.

305
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,200
Of course.

306
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,980
Papa, Mama, just send him off.

307
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,800
The car's been running for so long
it's running out of gas.

308
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Alright, give me a hug.

309
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
Take care, my dear.

310
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,720
Are you forgetting someone, Apo?

311
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I don't think so.

312
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,680
Think about it again.

313
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,040
- Without him, you can't fall asleep!
- Mm!

314
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,480
It's your most beloved pet,

315
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,080
Jessica, my dear!

316
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,850
- Oh, Jessica!
- That's right, Jessica!

317
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,520
- Do I have to take him?
- Jessica is here!

318
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,200
Oh...

319
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,160
I...

320
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,600
- I completely forgot about him!
- Yeah!

321
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,800
How could you even?

322
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
He's your sleep buddy!

323
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,160
Wow...

324
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
- Alright, hurry along.
- Come on.

325
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,600
You, can you help...

326
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Do I really get to live here
with M.R. Suriya?

327
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,900
We will eat together,

328
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,840
watch TV together,

329
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,520
and sleep on the same bed!

330
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
We're sleeping separately.

331
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
- Hey!
- So don't worry.

332
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,760
Wait,

333
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,240
did you touch me?

334
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,840
How did you know my thoughts?

335
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Look,

336
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,120
just looking at you,

337
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,220
I can see

338
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,200
all those delusional thoughts.

339
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
And tonight,

340
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,120
don't sneak into my room.

341
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,840
Right,

342
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,130
you take the small bedroom.

343
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
Wait, you...

344
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,040
Hey! Why did you come in here?!

345
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,320
We'll have to move
into the same room now.

346
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,640
Mother sent Butler Francois
to keep an eye on us.

347
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,920
Who's Butler Francois?

348
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,080
I will send you to Siao Dara

349
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,440
to expose a phony couple.

350
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,360
Catch them red-handed!

351
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
There's no time.

352
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,320
Just my luck!

353
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,080
From now on,
we'll have to act as full-time lovers,

354
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,170
Apo.

355
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,280
No one has answered
the door yet, Milady.

356
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,200
They are probably staging the scene.

357
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,880
Hey,

358
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,800
and who is this Butler Francois?!

359
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,540
Why are you so terrified of him?

360
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,920
Francois is a butler
for special missions,

361
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,600
and he doesn't work at Siao Dara.

362
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,700
Frankly,

363
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,440
he's more like Mother's right-hand man.

364
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,080
Rumor has it

365
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,440
that he was a former spy,

366
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,160
so my mom often sends him to investigate.

367
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,240
Yes!

368
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
- Hey!
- Freeze!

369
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,080
You sure are taking your time.

370
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,240
The bad guys already ran off.

371
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,640
Luckily,

372
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,880
the important documents
are still with me.

373
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
And who are you?

374
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,840
- Whoa!
- Hey!

375
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm Frank,

376
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,120
an FBI agent assigned
to investigate this case.

377
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
But first,

378
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,000
can you lower your guns?

379
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,160
Hurry and chase after the bad guys.

380
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,320
I've called in reinforcements
to look for clues here.

381
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,960
Come along!

382
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,920
Isn't it like
something out of a fantasy?

383
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,760
I guess she probably doesn't buy
that we love each other,

384
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
so she sent Francois to look into it.

385
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,080
Argh!!

386
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,000
I thought I beat the final boss!

387
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,640
For that reason,
when Francois is around,

388
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,880
we need to act like we're madly in love.

389
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,100
Got it?

390
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
We're running out of time.

391
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,160
- Follow me!
- What?

392
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,720
Whoa!

393
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,320
My apologies for interrupting.

394
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,040
Uh, it's...

395
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,200
- It's not...
- No need to be shy, baby.

396
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,840
It's what lovers do.

397
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,080
Well then, allow me to introduce myself.

398
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,320
I, Butler Francois,

399
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,600
am here to serve
M.R. Suriya and Young Master Apo

400
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,320
during your stay at this penthouse.

401
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,320
Hey...

402
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,760
Your silly Excellency, asleep?

403
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,880
I am about to.

404
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,320
Why?

405
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,520
You can't fall asleep?

406
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,620
Mm...

407
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,370
maybe this place feels unfamiliar,

408
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,760
and someone beside me is also unusual.

409
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
Who'd sleep in this situation?

410
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,120
Huh.

411
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,640
Just say your heart's
too shaken to sleep.

412
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,000
Ugh,

413
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,440
the audacity!

414
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,280
My heart's shaken for you?

415
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,040
Then, take off that necklace
and look me in the eye.

416
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Just kidding.

417
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,480
But I see you're really blushing.

418
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,560
Blushing when?

419
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,880
I'm not blushing.

420
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,120
Alright, alright.

421
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,600
I'll sleep on the floor,

422
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,320
so you can quit being so tense.

423
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,800
Uh, Your Excellency...

424
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,120
It's fine.

425
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,200
I'll take the floor.

426
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,560
I'm used to it.

427
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,720
Whatever floats your boat.

428
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,920
But if you sleep worse
than you did before,

429
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,050
don't say I didn't warn you.

430
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,640
How did I get up here?

431
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,250
Is it...

432
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,150
Wow...

433
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,880
He's a total Sleeping Beauty.

434
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,520
Then, awaken me with a kiss.

435
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,560
Whoa!

436
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,000
You said I was
a Sleeping Beauty, didn't you?

437
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,280
And why did you wake up
just to stare at me?

438
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,400
What are you talking about?!

439
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,840
I wasn't staring at you!

440
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,560
Are you... Are you narcissistic,

441
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
- crazy, or...
- Hush.

442
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,720
Baby,

443
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
don't forget

444
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,380
that we have to be loving,

445
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,040
not fighting.

446
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,440
I wasn't staring at you! Are you...

447
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,720
Are you narcissistic,

448
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,280
- crazy, or...
- Hush.

449
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,260
I heard some noises,
measured at approximately 70 decibels

450
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,580
and possibly from fighting, Milady.

451
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,440
Morning, baby.

452
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,400
Uh, morning, boo boo.

453
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,440
Last night,
did I cuddle you too tightly?

454
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,680
If I did, you can tell me, baby.

455
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,840
I could barely breathe, actually.

456
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,640
Then, I'll go easy on you tonight.

457
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,280
Aww.

458
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Is my baby blushing?

459
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,360
What would you like for breakfast,
Your Excellency and Young Master?

460
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
- Uh, I'll have a fried egg...
- It's all good.

461
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,080
I'll cook for my fiancé today.

462
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,000
Please.

463
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,040
Milady,

464
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,120
they seem like a couple
on the first day of moving in together.

465
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,200
But please be at ease.

466
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
No matter how many footsteps,

467
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,120
seconds,

468
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,520
and breaths they take,

469
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,360
nothing escapes my sight!

470
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,120
That's not my voice lagging.

471
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,800
That was an affirming laugh, Milady.

472
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,600
Thank you.

473
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,360
Here you go.

474
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,520
Thank you.

475
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,650
- Ya,
- Hm?

476
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
can you open this for me?

477
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,880
Of course.

478
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,480
Would you like me to try?

479
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,360
Here.

480
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Thank you.

481
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,680
Thailand's hotels are second to none!

482
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,440
Siao Tawan Hotel has remained number 1
in 'The Best Hotels in Asia' ranking

483
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,960
for 10 consecutive years.

484
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,920
The current executives, M.C. Jakkawarn

485
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,080
and his son M.R. Suriya,

486
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,240
both say to us determinedly that

487
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,440
they are aiming for 'The Best Hotels
in the World' within 5 years!

488
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Aww,

489
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,880
you're the best out there, Ya!

490
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,500
Good job!

491
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,400
Of course,

492
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,880
thanks to my amazing boyfriend
for the encouragement!

493
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,680
Ow, that hurts!

494
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,600
You're the cutest.

495
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,240
Here you go.

496
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,040
Let me feed you.

497
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,880
It's good, isn't it?

498
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,360
Gosh!

499
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,320
When is he gonna leave?!

500
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,120
I can't feel my butt anymore!

501
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,440
You wanna see us kissing or something?!

502
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
Mr. Butler,

503
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,160
I want to spend
some alone time with my fiancé.

504
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,760
You can be dismissed.

505
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,720
Yes, sir.

506
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,600
Milady,

507
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,720
I'm not a shipper,

508
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,520
but these two...

509
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,760
are totally a thing!

510
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,920
What I witnessed was so romantic!

511
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,640
If they're not a couple,

512
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,360
then I don't know what is!

513
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,760
Your ship is going to sink very soon.

514
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,200
I will call the backup myself.
