[Phopthorn Wadtawan]

189
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,880
[No results found]

190
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,600
Clear as day!

191
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,400
Not only did my soul
transfer to another body,

192
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,200
but I also landed
in a parallel universe!

193
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
In this world, I am Apo,

194
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,940
an heir to a multi-billionaire!

195
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,480
Welcome!

196
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,131
Come on.

197
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,840
Whoa...

198
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,280
Are you sure this is a house,

199
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,680
not a palace?

200
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,040
This way, Young Master Apo.

201
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,840
Welcome home, Apo Yue!

202
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,440
Wait, but this is just a homecoming...

203
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
Does it really have to be this extra?

204
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,000
Here's your welcome drink,
Young Master Apo.

205
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,200
Welcome home, my dear son!

206
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,800
Everyone's happy now that you're home!

207
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,705
I'm... I'm also happy.

208
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,000
Good job, folks!

209
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,600
Nice work!

210
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,286
I'll prepare the bath water for you.

211
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Thank you...

212
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,720
What?

213
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,020
A bill counter?

214
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,600
Am I in a bank or something?

215
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,280
That's the hot angel.

216
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
Wait...

217
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,040
Why is he here?

218
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
What a soft,

219
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,965
comfortable bed!

220
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,760
This is so freaking comfy!!

221
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,200
And a spacious room at that!

222
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Boom!

223
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,800
Such a diva move!

224
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Young Master,

225
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,920
the bath tub is ready.

226
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,960
Okay...

227
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,960
- Is that a real giraffe?!
- The mineral water from the Alps

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,360
at 37 degree Celsius,
just how you prefer.

229
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,800
I've already added some milk oil

230
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,720
in a proper ratio to the water

231
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,840
to protect
and nourish your skin, Young Master.

232
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,600
Whoa!

233
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Auntie...what are you doing?

234
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,160
Oh...

235
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,920
I'll give you a bath, of course.

236
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,760
It's... It's okay.

237
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,160
It's better if you wait outside.

238
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
Uh, sure.

239
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Uh, I'm fine.

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,400
I want to give myself a bath.

241
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,600
Can you do it?

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,280
- I can.
- Alright...

243
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,240
This is
the first nice bath in my life

244
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,060
- since I was born...
- Young Master!

245
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Yes?!

246
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,560
Are you completely sure?

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,787
Uh, I am...

248
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,920
Please go outside, Auntie...

249
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,400
And lock the door if you could.

250
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,680
Sure.

251
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,760
Please watch out for the slipperiness.

252
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
- Uh, alright.
- Alright, then.

253
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm right outside.

254
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
I've prepared some outfits for you.

255
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,000
Which one
would you like to wear for dinner?

256
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:25,640
Uh, dinner?

257
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,440
That's right.

258
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,600
Alright.

259
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,280
These are all from
your favorite collections, Young Master.

260
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,600
Where's the dinner?

261
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,480
At home, Young Master.

262
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,400
At home?

263
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,560
Right...

264
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,880
People wear this to dinner?

265
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,880
Yes...

266
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,920
Young Master...

267
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
are you sure?

268
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,440
Yes.

269
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,570
It's a normal fit, isn't it?

270
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,960
The Young Master is ready!

271
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,560
- These look really good.
- Certainly.

272
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,560
Appetizing!

273
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,600
Allow me to serve
the roasted suckling pig.

274
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,960
Go ahead.

275
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,960
These are all your favorite dishes, Apo.

276
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,680
Do you remember who this is?

277
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,840
This is Ashin,

278
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,440
your older brother, dear.

279
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Oh...

280
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,760
Good evening, Ashin!

281
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,160
My apologies!

282
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,520
Papa, Mama...

283
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,760
he must be hit really hard in the head.

284
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,838
He never greeted me like that,

285
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,200
and always acted like I smell
when he sees my face.

286
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,120
That's out of nowhere.

287
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,520
Uh, should we eat now?

288
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,480
Otherwise, the food's gonna be cold

289
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,240
and not as good.

290
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
Here you go.

291
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Wait,

292
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,760
we can't start just yet.

293
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,480
We have to wait
for your important guest.

294
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,240
My important guest?

295
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,880
Mm!

296
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
This is...

297
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,413
the hot guy
that stares me down from the hospital.

298
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,880
You don't remember anyone at home,

299
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,880
but do you remember him?

300
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,320
I only remember...

301
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
how handsome he is...

302
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Uh...

303
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,200
So...

304
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,446
- you are...
- Oi,

305
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,080
he's one important person in your life.

306
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,160
If you forget him,
he's gonna be desperately dejected!

307
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Su...

308
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
Su...

309
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,880
Su...

310
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,720
Sumi...

311
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
Su...

312
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,640
Uh, Su...

313
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,640
Like hell I can remember!

314
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,520
I'm not even Apo!

315
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,720
Suriya.

316
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,580
M.R. Suriya

317
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Suriyadechakorn,

318
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
your fiancé.

319
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,240
My...

320
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
My fiancé?!

321
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,464
Uh, right...

322
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,960
The body's owner has a fiancé?

323
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,160
That means...

324
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
I have to marry him?

325
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,120
Apo...

326
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,760
Are you quite alright?

327
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,120
I've only seen you
taken a few bites before you came out.

328
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm... I'm fine.

329
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,800
Or is it that...

330
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,840
you're avoiding me?

331
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm not avoiding you.

332
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Apo,

333
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,600
look at me for just a bit.

334
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Uh...

335
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,200
I...

336
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,320
If there's anything on your mind,

337
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,540
you can tell me,

338
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
baby.

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,640
"Baby," he said?

340
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,840
Why are we calling each other "baby"?

341
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,760
You're silly!

342
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,120
Argh!

343
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,880
Uh...

344
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,040
Do you want to know
how we become lovers?

345
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,640
How does he know what I think?

346
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:59,646
I guess your memory
hasn't properly recovered...

347
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Tomorrow,

348
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,280
why don't we go on a date
to remind you of us?

349
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:31,666
[Mr. Fiancé]

350
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,970
Whoa...

351
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
It seems like
Apo is madly in love with that Mister,

352
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,400
while he looks like
he was forced out of bed.

353
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
What's going on between these two?

354
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:49,800
[Apo: I booked a fine-dining place, Ya
Suriya: Okay]

355
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,040
[Apo: Where are you? I miss you!
Suriya: In a meeting]

356
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,280
[Apo: What are you doing?
Apo: Done with the meeting? IMY!]

357
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,560
[Apo: Morning, Mr. Fiancé
Apo: Have a good meeting!]

358
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,720
One-sided conversation?

359
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,120
So it's a one-sided love?

360
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,760
I thought I hit the jackpot

361
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,680
by reincarnating
in a parallel world as Young Master Apo,

362
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,720
but I'll have to marry a random guy.

363
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,320
He's a snack and everything,

364
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,480
but it's a deal-breaker if he's weird!

365
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
If this is how things are,

366
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,200
will I really get to live
happily ever after?

367
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,620
No, no, no!

368
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm not getting married!

369
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Papa!

370
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,760
It's really late.

371
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,280
Why aren't you going to bed?

372
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm worried about you,
so I thought I might stop by.

373
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,740
Apo,

374
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,080
get a good rest

375
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,560
so that your memory quickly returns.

376
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,960
When you're better,

377
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,880
you'll get engaged to His Excellency

378
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,760
and get your happy ending.

379
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,040
Mama and I will also be at ease.

380
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,960
Uh...

381
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,440
you said

382
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,240
you wanted me to be happy, right?

383
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,200
Mm.

384
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What if

385
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,720
I told you

386
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,440
my happiness is not marriage anymore?

387
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
It's fine

388
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,120
because your memory hasn't returned.

389
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
When it does,

390
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,120
you'll be happy about it again.

391
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,560
No, that's not what I meant.

392
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,400
I...

393
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,400
I'm not into him anymore,

394
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,240
- Eh?
- and he...

395
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,000
doesn't seem to be
into me all that much.

396
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,720
It's gonna be
a failed marriage eventually.

397
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,080
You don't want to see
your son miserable, do you?

398
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,880
Haiya...

399
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,800
Then,

400
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,200
can we cancel the wedding?

401
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,600
We can, actually.

402
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,920
But I'll also
cancel your name in my will.

403
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
What?

404
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Don't "what" me.

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
I'll disinherit you entirely

406
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,920
if you don't marry His Excellency.

407
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,600
Papa!

408
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,480
And if you must insist,

409
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,640
don't call me Papa ever again!

410
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
Mark my words!

411
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Alright, alright,

412
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,900
I think you should go to sleep,

413
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,350
so you have a speedy recovery.

414
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,920
Come on, get a lot of rest.

415
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Lay down.

416
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Quick.

417
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,520
Come on.

418
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,280
Go to bed.

419
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Rise and shine.

420
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,920
- Whoa!
- Uh...

421
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,240
Are you okay?

422
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,440
Sorry about that...

423
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,640
Wait a sec.

424
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,480
Why would I be nice to him?

425
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,320
If I can't call off the wedding,

426
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,040
then I'll give him a crash out

427
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
so intense that he breaks up with me!

428
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,480
I don't feel bad for you.

429
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,200
This…

430
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,720
is not the half of what you deserve.

431
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,000
Flabbergasted, huh?

432
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,680
And this is just
level 1 of the evilness.

433
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,200
And who on earth
allowed you to come in my room?

434
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,320
Your parents.

435
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,560
They saw that you slept in late,

436
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
so they asked me to wake you up.

437
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,920
Late for what?

438
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't have to go anywhere, do I?

439
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,800
Where am I going?
I'm not going anywhere!

440
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm...sleepy!

441
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,400
I want to sleep, don't you get it?

442
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,520
Leave me alone!

443
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,520
Gosh,

444
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,440
please, all I want is to sleep.

445
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm begging you, just leave!

446
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,480
We have a date today,

447
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,640
did you forget?

448
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,160
Which is the best stocks
to invest in right now?

449
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
With the current state of the economy,
I think the international ones are...

450
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,070
Young Master Apo is here... Eek!

451
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,200
How 'bout that?

452
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,440
My outfit delivers.

453
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,600
My hair delivers.

454
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,840
My earrings deliver.

455
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,200
I deliver...

456
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,720
like a delivery guy I was!

457
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,480
Apo, Apo...

458
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,600
why are you dressed like that?

459
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,520
You have a date today, don't you?!

460
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,440
Do you want to go change?

461
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,240
This is what I like, Mama.

462
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,760
To be myself is to be free, right?!

463
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,840
If Ya can't handle this,

464
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,960
- then he can leave...
- Of course, I can handle it.

465
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,480
He's pretty cute
when he dresses like this.

466
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
I like it.

467
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
I want this one,

468
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,760
this one,

469
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,960
this one,

470
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,800
this one,

471
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,760
this one,

472
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,000
and that one.

473
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,040
Put them on this gentleman's bill.

474
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,560
If I didn't feel bad for him,

475
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,800
I'd even ask for
the most expensive item in the store.

476
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,280
Which one
is the most expensive item?

477
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,680
The most expensive item?

478
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
This is the one.

479
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,680
Then, I'll take it.

480
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,200
As for the rest,
deliver them to Apo's house.

481
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,520
Of course.

482
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,920
I want to play this game.

483
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
How 'bout that?

484
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,000
Embarrassed?

485
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,800
That's a question for myself!

486
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Am I embarrassed?

487
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
Good job.

488
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,960
With the hard work
you put into dancing,

489
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,520
I guess I should take you
to a nice restaurant.

490
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,320
With that coy face of his,

491
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,360
I thought it was gonna be easy.

492
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,840
A tough one, I see.

493
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,720
Here comes the ultimate dish

494
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,240
to make sure he learns the hard way!

495
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,880
How 'bout that?

496
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,160
Meet Soi Ju, the raw beef signature!

497
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,320
Let's see

498
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
if he could eat it!

499
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,160
Come on,

500
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,730
I'll give you the big piece.

501
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,240
Big bite.

502
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
Big bite!

503
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,560
What? Here!

504
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,400
Here's the freshest, juiciest raw beef.

505
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,440
Eat up.

506
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,440
I don't eat raw beef.

507
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
Can you show me how?

508
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
What do you mean you don't eat it?

509
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,840
What's so hard
about opening up your mouth

510
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
and chew it?

511
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,200
How 'bout that?

512
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,000
I guess the Big Ju

513
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,640
is the ultimate ick for him.

514
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Hmm!

515
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
This is delicious!

516
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,160
What?! He actually ate it?!

517
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,760
All thanks to you, Apo,

518
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
for taking me here;

519
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,800
otherwise, I would have
never discovered how good this is.

520
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,080
How should I break it to him

521
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,080
that I don't want to get married?

522
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,160
He's gotta know

523
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm not the real Apo!

524
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,240
I knew at first glance.

525
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,440
Uh, you did?

526
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,840
What did you know?

527
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,400
What?
How does he know what I'm thinking?

528
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,880
It's like he can read my mind.

529
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,000
"What?
How does he know what I'm thinking?

530
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,720
It's like he can read my mind."

531
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,240
That's right.

532
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,370
I can read your mind.

533
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,880
Huh?!

534
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,840
- People in this world can read minds?!
- "Can read minds?!"

535
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,760
I knew from the first time we met

536
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,680
that you were not Apo.

537
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,800
If you don't want me
to tell the Yue family

538
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,080
that you're not their son,

539
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,160
then...

540
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,060
what would you say if we work together?

541
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,160
No matter what,
I'll have to marry for business,

542
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,440
and you

543
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,360
will remain in this body.

544
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,480
So...

545
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,320
should we just get married,

546
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,720
Mr. Apo in disguise?

547
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,020
All things considered...

548
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,960
might as well give it a shot!

549
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,240
From now on,

550
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,960
I'll train you to become the real Apo.

551
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,920
First,

552
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,440
you need a makeover.

553
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,440
Keep in mind that Apo is a fashionista.

554
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,240
Your outfits need layering,

555
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,880
- and accessories are indispensable.
- Take these.

556
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,760
This is what you call elegance

557
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,320
and monarch,

558
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,760
deserving of Apo.

559
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,640
Laying it on thick?

560
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,870
But I do think...

561
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,320
we're missing something.

562
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,560
Let's see.

563
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,400
Give me your left hand.

564
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Come on.

565
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,840
This is the right Apo.

566
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,560
Secondly,

567
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,720
as Apo is the young master
of the Yue family,

568
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,160
his manner is flawless
in every movement.

569
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,410
The dishes we're gonna eat today

570
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,760
will come in different courses,

571
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,480
and the cutlery seen before you

572
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,240
is arranged according to the order

573
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,120
that the dishes will be served.

574
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,160
First, we'll start from the baked goods.

575
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,640
Break it off

576
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,080
into a bite-size piece.

577
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,440
Scoop some butter,

578
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,400
and spread it on.

579
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,440
Next up is how to eat soup.

580
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,960
Scoop away from you,

581
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,480
and eat from the side of the spoon.

582
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,120
Coming up next is the main course.

583
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,400
Place the knife like so,

584
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,920
cut it,

585
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,440
and put it in your mouth
with the front facing you.

586
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Beef is to be paired with red wine,

587
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,760
and the proper way to drink it

588
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,240
is hold the glass by the stem

589
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,600
so that your body temperature
doesn't interfere with the wine's.

590
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,440
Then, give it a swirl,

591
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,560
exposing the wine to some air.

592
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,840
Cheers.

593
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,120
You're a grown-up
who can't drink alcohol?

594
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,520
Well,

595
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,280
who'd be born
holding a glass of wine like you,

596
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,240
Your Excellency?

597
00:37:32,264 --> 00:37:33,064
Hey.

598
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,280
Third,

599
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
the real Apo must be a diva.

600
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
He's arrogant and spoiled.

601
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,040
More.

602
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,280
More passion!

603
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
More energy!!

604
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,810
This... This doesn't look arrogant.

605
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
This looks ridiculous.

606
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,480
What?

607
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,680
You weren't clear with the briefing.

608
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,160
If you can do it,

609
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,440
why don't you show me?

610
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,960
How was it?

611
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
Your turn now.

612
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,020
Smile widely.

613
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,000
Smile!

614
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,520
Then, raise your eyebrows.

615
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Stop smiling.

616
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,440
That's your Apo face.

617
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
Smile the least you can,

618
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,000
and if you have to,

619
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,680
just smirk.

620
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,720
Or if you have to look at someone,

621
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,680
just give them a side eye.

622
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,280
Keep your chin up.

623
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
Now, try it.

624
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
What's wrong with your nostrils?

625
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,160
Nothing!

626
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,800
My son is the cutest!

627
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,840
Would you like some water, Young Master?

628
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,760
No.

629
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
How about some tea?

630
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,640
No.

631
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
How about some orange juice.

632
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
No.

633
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,040
What should we do?

634
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,720
No!!

635
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
I haven't said anything!

636
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,720
Uh, I think he's trying to say

637
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,400
that he doesn't want any drinks

638
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,240
and to just skip to the meal.

639
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,160
Your Excellency,

640
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,160
you know Apo really well!

641
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,440
What an adorable couple!

642
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,040
How about this?

643
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,560
Let's all have a meal now.

644
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,640
- Let's go.
- Sounds good.

645
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,280
- Put these away!
- Thanks.

646
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,600
The duck is from a nice restaurant.

647
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,920
- It's big, isn't it, Apo?
- This one is also good.

648
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Remember:

649
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,960
For Apo, everything has to be perfect

650
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,200
and supreme.

651
00:41:00,848 --> 00:41:02,720
He won't settle for anything less.

652
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,340
If he sees something
he doesn't like, he will blow up.

653
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Wow...

654
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,240
But these are all expensive dishes!

655
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
How could I even complain?

656
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,240
Ugh!

657
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,000
Here goes nothing!

658
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,720
- Ah!
- Goodness!

659
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,200
I want sour curry!

660
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,240
An A5 wagyu sour curry

661
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,400
topped with caviar eggs,

662
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,960
drizzled with truffle oil,

663
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,520
and served as an Asian fusion twist!

664
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,640
As for these boring dishes,

665
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,640
bear in your little minds

666
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,040
I don't care for them!

667
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,760
Understood?!

668
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,520
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

669
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,560
There.

670
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,760
My dear brother is back.

671
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
That's right!

672
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Indeed!

673
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,040
Apo, you've made a full recovery.

674
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
I'm truly happy, dear!

675
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,760
Seeing Apo like this,

676
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,720
I'm feeling a lot better!

677
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,320
In that case,
for the engagement ceremony,

678
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,720
you can stick
to the same auspicious date!

679
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,960
Got it, Papa.

680
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,660
You and Mama don't have to be worried,

681
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,880
whether it's about
the ceremony or Apo.

682
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,760
I'll take good care of everything.

683
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,750
That's amazing!

684
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,880
Are you happy

685
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,480
that we'll finally become one?

686
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,200
I couldn't be happier.

687
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,080
Uh,

688
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,680
excuse me to eat in my own room;

689
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,400
otherwise, I'll puke it all out.

690
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,160
Papa's Apo is finally back!

691
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,600
Also, there's one more thing

692
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,600
that will make you
resemble the real Apo.

693
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,160
Wait,

694
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,920
there's more?!

695
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,680
The last one is very important;

696
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,700
the real Apo

697
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,360
is madly in love with me.

698
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,990
Are you a narcissist?

699
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,120
If you have to send home your fiancé,

700
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,360
what would you do?

701
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,000
Bye-bye, sir.

702
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,120
Don't you think we need more than that?

703
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
We are engaged!

704
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,200
A sincere farewell to you.

705
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,010
Bon voyage, Mr. Fiancé.

706
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,440
There's a mosquito?

707
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,560
Ow!

708
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,760
What's the matter with you?!

709
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,680
Me?

710
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,680
Then,

711
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,000
tomorrow, I will take you
to the field training.

712
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,080
Uh, field training?

713
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,200
Be prepared,

714
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,720
- Huh?
- got it?

715
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,280
[Love Sharing and Heart Weaving:
For the Future of Impoverished Children]

716
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,720
- May I have a picture?
- Sure.

717
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,000
Look this way, please.

718
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,480
You can move closer.

719
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,760
Please smile.

720
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,840
Hello, everyone.

721
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,400
You're here today with Soup Gai

722
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,400
in 'Hello, Hi-So'!

723
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,360
We are now at Siao Tawan Hotel,

724
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,440
for its event,
'Love Sharing and Heart Weaving:'

725
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,160
For the Future
of Impoverished Children.'

726
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,720
which is massively attended
by celebrities from around Thailand!

727
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,480
And the biggest sensation of all

728
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,320
is the couple
who owns a multi-billion durian farm,

729
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,520
Mr. Korn and Mr. Karn,

730
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,400
showing up together
with a romantic nature

731
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,240
and gracing our presence in this event!

732
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,560
Looks like I gotta talk to them!

733
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,480
Ooh, here they are!

734
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,800
Mr. Korn, Mr. Karn, right this way!

735
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,760
- Hi, Gai.
- Hi, Gai.

736
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,560
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

737
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,680
Mm! Soup Gai here.

738
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,410
- Soup Gai.
- Soup Gai.

739
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,560
The way you finish
each other's sentences

740
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,760
is so 'Couple of the Year'!

741
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,800
Really? Gai,

742
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,560
don't tease Karn too much.

743
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,880
He's all red now.

744
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,480
Mm!

745
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,200
The reason I brought you here today

746
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,200
is because I want you to see

747
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,600
how real couples act.

748
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,200
That's all it takes to be a couple?

749
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,840
Easy as pie!

750
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,480
Wait, Your freaking Excellency?

751
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,600
Isn't this too close?

752
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,540
Don't...

753
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,640
Don't get any closer!

754
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
Or else, I'll...

755
00:47:08,353 --> 00:47:09,413
- I'll...
- Oh!

756
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,960
- Isn't that Ya?
- I'll...

757
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,920
Oh, Ya!

758
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,000
Apo!

759
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,440
Do you want to join us?

760
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,600
Mr. Suriya, Mr. Apo, right this way!

761
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,200
Please!

762
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
Come on!

763
00:47:21,431 --> 00:47:22,381
Hello.

764
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,960
As we're with two lovey-dovey couples,

765
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,520
namely Korn and Karn

766
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,720
and Suriya and Apo,

767
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,200
today, I have a guessing game

768
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,600
to test how well these couples
know their partner!

769
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,280
The rule is simple:

770
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,000
I will ask a question,

771
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,520
and you guys will write your own answer

772
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,280
and your partner's on the board.

773
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,600
Then, you'll all
reveal your answer at the same time.

774
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,440
The couple that gets
more answers right is the winner!

775
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,560
Wow,

776
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,560
we'll have an edge on them
with this kind of game.

777
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,620
- Exactly!
- Ooh!

778
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,280
You guys are a new one.

779
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,080
How could you possibly even beat us?

780
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,320
Win the game

781
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,400
before you brag about the game.

782
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,880
Ooh!

783
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,760
Well, well, well!

784
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,920
Consider how confident you are,

785
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,560
I guess you are ready, aren't ya?

786
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,080
The first question is...

787
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,560
Your favorite destination!

788
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,480
- Ooh!
- Woo!

789
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,280
Three, two, one...

790
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,120
Let's see!

791
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,600
[Korn: Maldives
Karn: Maldives]

792
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,440
Suriya says
Apo likes to go to the beach!

793
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,160
And Apo says Suriya likes to go to...

794
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,600
- "My house"!
- Whoa!

795
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,520
- Woohoo!
- That's spicy, everyone!

796
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,080
I love it!

797
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,680
And the next question is...

798
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,640
Your favorite food!

799
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,840
- Ooh!
- Wow!

800
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,760
[Korn: Peking duck
Karn: Carbonara pasta]

801
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,640
Those are the same exact answers!

802
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,950
And Apo says
[Apo: Sour curry]

803
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,600
Suriya likes...Soi Ju!
[Suriya: Something hot]

804
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,200
Oh! So...

805
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,280
when did you take him
to eat that hot dish, Apo?

806
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,040
- Ooh!
- Soi Ju!

807
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,200
The last question is...

808
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,120
A favorite activity to do
when you're sad!

809
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,320
Gahh!

810
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,600
Here they go again
[Korn: Being together]

811
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,560
giving the same answers!
[Karn: Being together]

812
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,200
And Apo says Suriya likes to...

813
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
"Watch me dance."

814
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,200
- Ohh!
- Darn.

815
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,150
It's unanimous!

816
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,960
The winner is
Mr. Korn and Mr. Karn!

817
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,280
Give them a round of applause!

818
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,000
That's so sweet!

819
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,320
So handsome!

820
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,680
Looking good!

821
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,640
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

822
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,960
Good job! Look at them!

823
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,600
Imagine how he will be

824
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,760
if they're together
even longer than this.

825
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,600
I can't believe

826
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,440
Ya got every single answer right.

827
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,320
I normally see
you're only interested in yourself,

828
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,600
not the other way around.

829
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,680
Hey, are you trying to call me out?

830
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,520
Oh,

831
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,680
I heard that Apo
was just dismissed from the hospital.

832
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,000
Are you feeling better now?

833
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,200
Are you being too hard
on your fiancé, Ya?

834
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,210
Hey...

835
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,130
You took him for events
right after he got out of the hospital?

836
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,760
Uh...

837
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,120
I'm better now.

838
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,360
Absolutely fine.

839
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,680
His Excellency
has been taking a good care of me.

840
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,960
Uh...

841
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,760
Excuse my manners, but...

842
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,960
I'm not used to this

843
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,380
since I've only heard Apo calling him,

844
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,040
"Ya, my baby Ya!"

845
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,800
Oh...

846
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,280
But Apo calling him like that
is lovely in a different way.

847
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,600
Right, Ya?

848
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,960
Uh, right.

849
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,440
Well, then,
please excuse me to use a toilet.

850
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,880
Apo...seems different.

851
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,400
He does?

852
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,040
Probably because
his memory hasn't fully returned.

853
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,680
He... He will get better.

854
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,780
I'm not complaining.

855
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,480
He's different in an adorable way.

856
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
Adorable?

857
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,480
Mm.

858
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,640
Even a lot more than he was.

859
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,240
Apo is not the only one who's different.

860
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,280
You're also different, Ya!

861
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,720
- Mm!
- You didn't care about him before,

862
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,840
but look at you now!

863
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,240
You already fell for him, didn't you?

864
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,840
Didn't you?

865
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:01,770
No, I didn't.

866
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,400
Out of ten questions,

867
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,960
you got zero right?

868
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,480
Be frank with me,

869
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,200
aren't you gonna
pay attention to me?

870
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,200
What?

871
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,160
I don't have mind reading ability
like someone else here.

872
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,320
Neither do Korn and Karn,

873
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,600
yet they know each other by heart.

874
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,760
People who love each other need to care

875
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,680
about what the other person likes.

876
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,080
This is what we have to work on.

877
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,640
We need to be more attentive.

878
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,860
We need to care more.

879
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,200
We're gonna break up anyway!

880
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,080
Why so serious?

881
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,320
We have a meal
scheduled with my family tomorrow.

882
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,400
Be prepared,

883
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,400
and don't forget our training.

884
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,560
Ugh, don't you see

885
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,920
how hard I was serving this past week?

886
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,320
Zero busting so far!

887
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,800
Just relax.

888
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,720
Huh?

889
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,400
So realistic that we have to share
a real goodbye kiss?

890
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,040
Hey, I'm not forgetting it!

891
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,120
Even though
I've never been in a relationship,

892
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,360
I'm not all that naive or anything.

893
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Ugh!

894
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,680
Is anything wrong?

895
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,160
I...

896
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,440
I'm not into you anymore.

897
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,880
You just don't remember

898
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,360
how much you were into me.

899
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,990
Geez!

900
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,880
You're so...

901
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,080
It's true that I used to be
madly in love with you,

902
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
but as of now,

903
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,200
I just don't.

904
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,920
I'm into someone else!

905
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,080
My type now is a bad boy

906
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,240
who is rugged,

907
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,840
tanned,

908
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,160
tattooed,

909
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,420
and muscular!

910
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,160
The Korean-looking type
with good taste like you

911
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,780
is in the past.

912
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,600
I don't believe you.

913
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,160
Apo is head over heels in love.

914
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,200
Watch.

915
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,240
Ow!

916
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,640
- Oh!
- What?!

917
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,720
I'm so sorry.

918
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,120
I was...

919
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,600
falling in love.

920
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,760
What?

921
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,160
Your tattoos...

922
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,640
are the biggest turn-ons.

923
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,320
If you don't mind,

924
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,320
can I have your number

925
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,600
in case I want some raw meat?

926
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,040
45!

927
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,320
That's a number
of my shoe size, sweetheart!

928
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,600
He's my man!

929
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,280
Uh...

00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,720
it's not what you think, ma'am.

931
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,320
I was just tripping!

932
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,680
How about

933
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,400
Wait...

934
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,600
Wait, you!
