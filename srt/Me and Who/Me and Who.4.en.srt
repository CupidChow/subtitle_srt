This is Tailah,

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,945
the person I...

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,560
have a crush on in the other world.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,240
Would you like to buy one more snack?

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
We've got a buy-one-get-one-free deal...

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,680
and the cashier's number
comes free, too.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,560
That would be sweet.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,200
Don't leave it hanging, give it a call.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,100
Sure thing.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,170
Here's your QR code.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,920
Hey, Thorn.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,320
A new delivery order just came in.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Can you help?

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah, sure!

22
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,584
Yeah!

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,720
But wait...

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,080
my shift's over.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,560
Thorn,

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,320
could you please help me?

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,640
I have to work on a group project.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,040
Please, my angel.

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
Please, Thorn, my little angel!

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,880
Please, please, please!

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,060
- I...
- Could you?

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,280
Here you go!

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,960
It'll just take a sec.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,170
It's just around the corner,
so do it on your way home.

35
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:32,694
Please.

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
And I had always said yes

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
whenever he asked me for help.

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,197
You like her?

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,920
Absolutely.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,400
She's gorgeous,

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,880
with perfect skin,

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,800
and sexy.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,840
What man could resist?

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,720
Don't you like her?

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,600
Aw,

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
alright, Giga Chad.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Then, what's your type?

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,560
Ignoring me, huh?

49
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:11,960
How about now?

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,080
Answer me!

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
What are you doing?

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Come on.

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
I like...

54
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,480
someone who's not into me.

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,320
Bruh!

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,520
Can't believe I waited for that.

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
You act like those men in K-drama.

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,760
I keep that feeling inside...

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,504
and haven't told him.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,880
Tai!

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,620
Wait,

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,865
you do remember me!

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
I heard you lost your memory.

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm happy that you remember me.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,717
Wait,

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,080
it is really you?

67
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

68
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,360
How did you get here?

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,840
I called you the other day, didn't I?

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,960
Tai who?

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
So you're Tai!

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,560
That Tai!

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,520
Quite literally.

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
That's my name.

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,960
Are you alright?

76
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Did you...

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
also reincarnate
into a parallel universe?

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
I did...

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
say a complete moron!

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
Do you need help?

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
You've been
watching movies or something?

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,200
Po!

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,060
Your hottest groomsman has arrived.

84
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,280
Who else is here?

85
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
Just get out for now.

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
Wait, here's your top!

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you.

88
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Gosh,

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
Po!

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,960
Whoa!

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,920
I thought I'd never catch you
in this outfit.

92
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,880
When I heard
you'd been in a car accident,

93
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
I thought you'd never get married.

94
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,680
And when Tailah found out…

95
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
he whimpers like a puppy.

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,211
Do you...

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,880
remember me?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
I'm Torphong.

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Your bestie, Tor.

100
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
Tor!

101
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,560
- I do remember!
- Come on, Tor.

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
He just got out of the hospital.

103
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
What's with all the questions?

104
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,240
Alright, alright.

105
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Think of it as driving away bad luck.

106
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
From now on,
I wish you and His Excellency

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,000
a long and healthy marriage.

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,560
Right, Tai?

109
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,930
Huh?

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,800
- Uh...
- Right?

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,960
From here, I wish you and him...

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,080
Oh, Your Excellency!

113
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Hello, there.

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
You've never been
interested in Apo before.

115
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,360
Suddenly you say yes to marrying him?

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,840
It's obvious you did it for money.

117
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,080
Poor Apo,

118
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,200
you shouldn't have fallen for this guy.

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,000
Uh...

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you...

121
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,400
having a staring contest?

122
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Ya!

123
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
I decided on the outfit I like.

124
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
What do you think?

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,640
Whatever you like,

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
I'll like, too.

127
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,960
If we're done here,

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
should we go?

129
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,320
But I have something to take care of,

130
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,120
so I'll drop you off at home.

131
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,120
Your Excellency?

132
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,960
If you wouldn't mind,

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,320
may I borrow your groom-to-be

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
for a small bachelor party?

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,960
I promise

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
I won't let him get drunk.

137
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,560
No worries, Your Excellency.

138
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,760
Don't stay out too late.

139
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,520
He's taking this act too seriously.

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,560
If he keeps doing this,

141
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
my heart will truly shiver.

142
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,620
Or I'll worry.

143
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
Go ahead, guys.

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
It's my treat.

145
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,120
"My treat," my ass.

146
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,760
This is your club,

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
and so are the drinks.

148
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,440
You get it both ways.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Alright, Mr. Rector!

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Even in a bachelor party,
you still sweat the small stuff.

151
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,080
Did you just make fun of my dad?

152
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Whenever you complain,

153
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
you're just like your dad.

154
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,000
We graduated a while ago,

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,640
but seeing you surprised me.

156
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,640
I thought I was meeting your dad!

157
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,160
Right, Po.

158
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,920
Be honest with me.

159
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,880
While we were away,

160
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,440
what did you do to make him
fall for you so hard

161
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,080
he ended up proposing?

162
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,920
Back then,

163
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,800
every time he saw you,

164
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,040
he acted like you were smelly socks.

165
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,640
Well,

166
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,600
I didn't do anything.

167
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,465
Really?

168
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,160
Or...

169
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,400
you pulled out your ace in the hole

170
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,120
to win His Excellency's heart?

171
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,680
Hey,

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
are you outta your mind?

173
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
I didn't do anything.

174
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Whoa!

175
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,400
Judging by that, you definitely did!

176
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
Hey, our friend officially has a hubby,

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
- so let's toast!
- Uh...

178
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,474
Come on!

179
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,280
Cheers to Young Master Apo!

180
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:33,086
Whoa!

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Does liquor really taste this good?

182
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
It absolutely does!

183
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,200
Only the best for you today.

184
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,320
Wait, wait, Po...

185
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,040
Don't hold back on the good stuff!

186
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,560
Here.

187
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,360
- I'll...
- Wait...

188
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,200
- get you some more.
- Tor!

189
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,760
Here you go, Po.

190
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,120
A special drink from me.

191
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,400
Huh? Let me see.

192
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
What's the matter with you?!

193
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
Huh?

194
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,000
Po was just discharged,

195
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,520
so go easy on him, would you?

196
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,040
Here,

197
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,240
have some appetizers,

198
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
so you don't get drunk.

199
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,240
Here.

200
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,881
Hey,

201
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,640
have whatever you want today.

202
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,280
It's on me.

203
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,280
Why did you decide
to treat me all of a sudden?

204
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,440
I wanna thank you

205
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,920
for helping me with college stuff

206
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,598
and Y MART.

207
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
Go ahead.

208
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,840
Huh?

209
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,400
Thank you.

210
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
There you go.

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,200
Eat up!

212
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,440
Thank you for everything.

213
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,919
It's all good.

214
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,755
If...

215
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
there's anything you need help with,

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
you can tell me.

217
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,960
Really?

218
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,640
Anything?

219
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,240
You mean it?

220
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,078
Then,

221
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,367
Phopthorn, could you...

222
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,080
be my guarantor for the motorcycle loan?

223
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,800
Please...

224
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,280
Please.

225
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
There you go.

226
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,960
You know I'd have no one else

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,720
if it weren't for you.

228
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,680
You're the only one I have, Phopthorn.

229
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,040
You know how important this is to me,

230
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
so could you please help?

231
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,440
Please.

232
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,640
Please...

233
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,720
Oh, thank you.

234
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
Po.

235
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,680
Apo.

236
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,640
Apo!

237
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,080
Huh?

238
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,240
Are you okay?

239
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
What made you zone out?

240
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Oh,

241
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm fine.

242
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
Are you feeling sick?

243
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Wanna go to the hospital?

244
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,490
Hey...

245
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,800
Po,

246
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,160
you're such a lightweight now.

247
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,920
You blushed only after a few sips.

248
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,010
Huh...

249
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,520
Oh!

250
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,720
Then,

251
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,400
let me hit the restroom for a sec.

252
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,600
I told you to go easy on him.

253
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,400
He just got out of the hospital.

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
[Tai: I passed by your favorite cake shop.
Tai: I'll buy some and take it to you]

255
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,720
[Tai: Do you have plans today?
Tai: Call me if you want to go anywhere]

256
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,960
[Tai: I'm worried.
Apo: Yeah, yeah]

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
[Tai: Don't forget to drink water
Tai: and have some food]

258
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,480
[Tai: Po, are you up?
Tai: You'll probably be hungover]

259
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
This Tailah

260
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,280
is into me?

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Be careful!

262
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,280
- What did you say?
- I think that's enough.

263
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
It's all gone.

264
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,720
- Enough. Put that down.
- It's gone already?

265
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,480
Oh, no,

266
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,960
don't break my jar.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,240
- Mr. Rector, let's sing!
- You're gonna break that!

268
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,320
- Po...
- ♫Hello...♫

269
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,920
- Aye, aye, aye!
- Careful...

270
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
♫I'm Apo♫

271
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,200
He's got that vibrato.

272
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,160
- Come here.
- No...

273
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,840
- Yeah, move back.
- Come on, get back here.

274
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,680
Ugh...

275
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
Hold him nicely so I can get this shot.

276
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,130
Tai!

277
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm so happy!

278
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,320
What are you so happy about?

279
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,280
That we met, Tai!

280
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,000
Mm.

281
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
You know, I even thought

282
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,160
that I...

283
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,240
would be all alone in this world.

284
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,760
Good thing I met you!

285
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Tai, I miss you so much.

286
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,920
I totally love you, buddy.

287
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,160
There.

288
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,080
You just spawned after that call,
Your Excellency.

289
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
You called him?

290
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Yeah.

291
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,840
Who's gonna carry him home?

292
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,640
I could.

293
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't bother.

294
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,560
I can take my fiance home.

295
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Huh?

296
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Home?

297
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
No, I'm not going.

298
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,520
- I don't wanna go home.
- Let's go.

299
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
No...

300
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm not going home!

301
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,160
He carried Po all the way there...

302
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
I've got everything recorded, you know?

303
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,500
What?

304
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,520
Why are you so grumpy?

305
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,080
I'm so happy!

306
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Thank you, Tailah,

307
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,280
for coming back to me again.

308
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,360
Thanks, Lord,

309
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,480
for letting me meet him again!

310
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Ow...

311
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,160
I wanna throw up...

312
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,560
But I also want more.

313
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,760
Another shot, please!

314
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,840
I want sour curry!

315
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,040
I want sour curry. I want sour curry!

316
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,800
Where can I get sour curry at this hour?

317
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Gosh!

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,400
What do you even think about?

319
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,620
Come here.

320
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,520
Lay down.

321
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,690
Pillow...

322
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,040
Stay still.

323
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,560
If Tai were this nice to me in
the other world, it would be nice.

324
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
I see.

325
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,120
You are into him, aren't you?

326
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,440
But it's fine,

327
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,400
since this Tai likes Apo.

328
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
That means...

329
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,760
you also like me!

330
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,760
Hey.

331
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,800
Do you even think of me
while you're drunk?

332
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
I do...

333
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
I totally do.

334
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,280
I do miss you a lot,

335
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,160
Tai!

336
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,480
I thought I'd never see you again.

337
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm happy!

338
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,240
- There,
- Ow...

339
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,680
how's your life here?

340
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Ugh!

341
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
What?

342
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
If you miss him that badly,

343
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,360
call him to take care of you, then.

344
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
"Him"?

345
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,720
Hey...

346
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,840
Who...

347
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
is him?

348
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,160
How did I get home?

349
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
Did Tai take me here?

350
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,120
[Torphong]

351
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,640
Did His Excellency take me home?

352
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,560
Is that rice porridge?

353
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,720
I'm just craving that.

354
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,280
What?

355
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,620
Huh?

356
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Are you full?

357
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,240
But there's still a lot left.

358
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
What about mine?

359
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,480
That was all.

360
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,680
Huh?

361
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,600
What?

362
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,600
Are you okay?

363
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm fine.

364
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Wait.

365
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,800
You definitely are not.

366
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,600
I can tell.

367
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,800
You even made breakfast
and didn't share.

368
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Are you...

369
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,640
mad at me?

370
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Mad?

371
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm not mad.

372
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,520
Why would I be mad at you?

373
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm in a hurry.

374
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,760
If you're hungry, order yourself food.

375
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,160
Right,

376
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
if you don't like that idea,

377
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,320
just have Tailah cook for you.

378
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,920
What?

379
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
What does that
have to do with Tailah?

380
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,490
Is he...

381
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,850
jealous?

382
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,700
That's crazy.

383
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,680
Why would he be?

384
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,080
Young Master,

385
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,080
Lady Pripprao has invited you to a meal.

386
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
She wants to meet privately
before the ceremony,

387
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,000
so she's clearly asking me
to leave her son.

388
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,800
That's a cliche Thai soap opera!

389
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Why do you...

390
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,360
want to meet me today?

391
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,600
Please, have a seat.

392
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Please.

393
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,960
I'll get straight to the point

394
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,280
since the ceremony
is merely a few days away.

395
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Here we go.

396
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,040
Take no offense,

397
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,560
but I still have doubts about you.

398
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
There she is.

399
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,280
She's really pushing me
to break up with her son.

400
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
So,

401
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,160
this is what we're gonna do.

402
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,480
Well, well, well,

403
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,360
what's your offer?

404
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,580
Take these bills!

405
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
And break up with my son!

406
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
I think...

407
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,120
you're underestimating me,
Lady Pripprao.

408
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,880
Why?

409
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,840
Are you saying
your love for him is genuine?

410
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
No,

411
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,920
I meant...

412
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,200
you're underestimating my value.

413
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,720
I will break up with your son,

414
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,480
but you have to make sure

415
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,360
to hit that subscribe button

416
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,480
and pay me every month.

417
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
If you miss even one payment,

418
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,390
Ya and I...

419
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,880
will get back to being lovey-dovey!

420
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,480
And if you miss three payments,

421
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,440
I will tell Ya about this.

422
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,520
And I will be a thorn
in your side forever!

423
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,720
You little brat!

424
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,920
This way, even if His Excellency
exposes me as a fake

425
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,760
and kicks me out,

426
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,180
I'll still have enough money
to start a new life!

427
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Apo!

428
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,740
Where is your mind flying off to?

429
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,880
Hello?

430
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,560
Oh, you've arrived, Master?

431
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
Of course, you can come in!

432
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,080
Alright!

433
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,160
Hello, Master.

434
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Hello.

435
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,280
Hello.

436
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,200
Master,

437
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,120
this is Apo.

438
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Apo,

439
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,600
meet Master Libidude.

440
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,360
Hello, Master...

441
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,280
Master Delulu?

442
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,160
Oh!

443
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,040
"Libidude."

444
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,160
Master Labubu.

445
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,400
It's "Libidude"!

446
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,200
Right, Master Libidude.

447
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
There!

448
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Oh, I will tell you this.

449
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,160
Master Libidude is very famous.
He even went viral on the Internet.

450
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,360
He's specialized
in spirit-gazing clairvoyance.

451
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,520
He can tell your past life and future
in just one glance.

452
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,720
He can even see people's past lives.

453
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,040
What clairvoyance?

454
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,640
- Spirit...
- "Spirit-gazing clairvoyance."

455
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,440
- "Spirit-gazing"?
- Mm!

456
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,640
Master,

457
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,640
can you sense anything?

458
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,240
Peculiar.

459
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
What is?

460
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
I cannot tell.

461
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,520
All I can say is...

462
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
I can sense a peculiar energy

463
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,160
possessing this body.

464
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,240
But I don't have a clue what it is.

465
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,570
So...

466
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,760
what do you mean by "peculiar energy"?

467
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,680
It's dorky,

468
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,520
sometimes dumb,

469
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,000
but it has no malice.

470
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,800
What about his fortune?

471
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,120
Is he a good match for Suriya?

472
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,120
Will their marriage last?

473
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,400
Or will it be over soon?

474
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,400
If you want to go on to Anagatamsanana,

475
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,480
we'll have to do another ritual.

476
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,920
Of course.

477
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,160
Lady Pripprao suddenly invited
the Young Master for a meal

478
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
and had Master perform
some kind of ritual.

479
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,800
Shit...

480
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Master,

481
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,200
how was it?

482
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
It's crystal clear.

483
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,280
If the couple stays together,

484
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,440
misery will be their fate.

485
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,440
But the two of them
will get through it well.

486
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
The engagement ceremony!

487
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
The engagement ceremony!

488
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,360
What about it?

489
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,680
Is it not auspicious?

490
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,800
The ceremony's going to be
full of problems,

491
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,600
and it might end in disaster.

492
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,400
But if these two make it through,

493
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,040
they'll have a lasting marriage

494
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,440
and a love that can't be broken.

495
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,600
But if all else fails,

496
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,880
this young man's life

497
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,120
will be turned

498
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,600
upside down!

499
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,920
Kim Karissanti Taraka,

500
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,720
the stars have no influence
over any soul.

501
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,880
Hey,

502
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,160
did my mother throw water at you?

503
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,920
Oh...

504
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,370
that's not it.

505
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,990
Your mother had...

506
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,840
that Master Labubu
perform some kind of ritual.

507
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,320
He was walking around me,

508
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,560
and I was so nervous
that I broke out in a sweat.

509
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,920
What did Master say?

510
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,080
He said we were kinda a match.

511
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,680
Uh...

512
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,810
He probably meant you and Apo.

513
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,280
And he said
if we made it through the ceremony,

514
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,960
we would have a lasting marriage.

515
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,880
He said that?

516
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,840
Hey, but...

517
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,360
he also said

518
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,320
that if we couldn't,

519
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,080
my life would be "turned upside down!"

520
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,760
Those are his exact words.

521
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,760
He even pointed his finger at me.

522
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,200
Don't believe him too much.

523
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,080
I think he was making things up.

524
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
It was garbage
from the moment he said...

525
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,600
we'd have a love
that can't be broken.

526
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,320
Who knows?

527
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,640
Uh...

528
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,960
I mean,

529
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
who knows what'll happen.

530
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,120
Nothing is certain.

531
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,960
No matter what,
we'll make it through the ceremony.

532
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,240
Ugh!

533
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,560
The ceremony is nothing.

534
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,520
You should've seen your mother's face

535
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,800
and how much she believed
in that Master Delulu.

536
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
I don't think

537
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,800
she's gonna mess
with our ceremony anymore.

538
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
You underestimate her.

539
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,960
Could it get worse?

540
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,720
- Hello.
- Hello, please go ahead inside.

541
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,520
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

542
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,200
- How are you doing, ma'am?
- Hi!

543
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,200
There are available seats inside.

544
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,600
- Congratulations, Boss!
- Oh, Nokpang!

545
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,920
I'll make my way inside.

546
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,880
Please.

547
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
Whoa,

548
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,240
matching outfits?

549
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,640
Are you excited, Ya?

550
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Well, a bit.

551
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,680
Thank you for coming.

552
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,320
Congrats, man.

553
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,560
I'll sing loudly for you
during the procession.

554
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,200
Before doing that,

555
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
please wait inside, Mr. Vocalist.

556
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,920
- Hey, Chan.
- Yes?

557
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,600
Help me out with the guests, would you?

558
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,760
Of course.

559
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
- This way.
- Please, right this way.

560
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,040
- Hello.
- Hello, there.

561
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,520
Which side of the family?

562
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,720
We're Apo's friends.

563
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,640
Oh!

564
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
I see.

565
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Hey, buddy.

566
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,720
Ooh, that's sweet, then!

567
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,040
What are you doing?

568
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,160
It's a high-five.

569
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,320
Apo's friend is also my friend.

570
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,000
After this,
we'll get to meet more often.

571
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,760
So, I think...

572
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
we should get to know each other.

573
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,350
Come on.

574
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,880
Who'd want to be friends with you?

575
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,120
But if you want
to be more than friends...

576
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,800
I wouldn't mind.

577
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,320
Whoa!

578
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
That's smooth!

579
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,840
Right?

580
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
- Not too bad, is it?
- Not at all.

581
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,640
Excuse me, then.

582
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,120
Well, then, allow me to go inside.

583
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,000
Please go ahead.

584
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,360
Oh!

585
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,010
Whoa.

586
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
- Tycoon Meng, Meifan!
- Hi, there!

587
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,920
- Hello, M.C. Jakkawarn, Lady Pripprao!
- Hello, Lady Pripprao!

588
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,480
- Beautiful jewelry!
- It must be, right?

589
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,280
Considering what a special day it is!

590
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,600
I only gave her the best.

591
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
- These are the best.
- Honey!

592
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,600
- Goodness!
- There he is!

593
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,200
- Hello.
- Wow!

594
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,280
Hi, ma'am.

595
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
You look even better

596
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,040
in this ceremony outfit, M.R. Ya!

597
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
- How handsome!
- He got it from his father.

598
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,720
Most definitely, Father.

599
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,360
He has a beautiful mother, too!

600
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,520
Like Master said, this is the day.

601
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I'm not letting this ceremony slip away.

602
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,920
Hey,

603
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,080
we can't let our guard down just yet.

604
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,520
I think my mother is still suspicious.

605
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,760
Why does His Excellency

606
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,600
look handsome today?

607
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,840
You thought I was handsome?

608
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,760
Why can I read your mind?

609
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
Where's your necklace?

610
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,680
What?

611
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,570
This morning, when I got dressed,

612
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,600
it was really hard to button it up,

613
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,680
so Auntie Da helped me out.

614
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
Maybe that's when it happened.

615
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,200
Gosh, I'm screwed!

616
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,050
I...

617
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,920
I think it was with the clothes

618
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,440
that the maids took to the laundry.

619
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
I'll look for it.

620
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,760
Wait, Apo.

621
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,360
Stay here.

622
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,560
If you leave,

623
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,400
my family will find out all about this.

624
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,840
Wait here

625
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
and don't go anywhere,

626
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,880
okay?

627
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,840
Ugh!

628
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
Don't get them wrinkled, ladies.

629
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,520
Uh, Your Excellency!

630
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,800
Why are you here?

631
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,080
Is there anything I can help with?

632
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,160
Auntie Da,

633
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,760
have you seen
the necklace Apo's been wearing?

634
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
The one with a purple stone pendant?

635
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,920
He lost it while he was changing.

636
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,680
Eh...

637
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,040
I think I might have seen it.

638
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,360
Everyone, let's look for it!

639
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
- Sure!
- Yes, Auntie!

640
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,720
Eh...

641
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,400
Where did he leave it?

642
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,950
Eh.

643
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,200
Have you found it?

644
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,000
- No.
- I don't see anything.

645
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Your Excellency,

646
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,360
I don't think we'll find it now.

647
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,680
But I will tell the girls
to look for it.

648
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,400
But for now, please go back to
the ceremony with Young Master.

649
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Please?

650
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Of course, Auntie Da.

651
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,480
I'll leave it to you.

652
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,160
Apo really wants
to wear this necklace to the ceremony.

653
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,520
Your Excellency...

654
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,960
He seems to genuinely care
about my little Young Master.

655
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,520
That puts me at ease.

656
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,760
Please do not be worried.

657
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,200
This is my little Young Master's
special day,

658
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,120
and he will look perfect.

659
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,000
I got it.

660
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
Please go back to Apo.

661
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,320
Everyone, let's hurry.

662
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Yes, Auntie!

663
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,560
This way.

664
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,440
What are you doing, M.R. Ya?

665
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
There's been a problem.

666
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,930
Huh?

667
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,840
It's almost the auspicious time.

668
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,800
I wonder how Apo's doing.

669
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,080
Chan!

670
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,280
- Yes?
- Can you stall Father and the tycoon?

671
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,860
- Huh?
- Don't let them see Apo

672
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,760
before the ceremony!

673
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,720
Understood?

674
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,920
Wait, Ya...

675
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,920
Ya!

676
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,080
He must be incredibly thrilled.

677
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,760
I think he might need your support.

678
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,640
Quite so!

679
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
Then, I'll stop by and give him some.

680
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,320
Tycoon Meng,

681
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,600
Father.

682
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,160
What lovely weather today.

683
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,720
How about...

684
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,800
we go grab some coffee?

685
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,080
Uh...

686
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,600
What a day from hell!

687
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,360
I might get caught,

688
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,080
and now I might have my mind read, too?

689
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,440
I want to just run away!

690
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,160
Who's that?

691
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
It's Tailah.

692
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Can I come in?

693
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Go ahead.

694
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,720
It's almost time for the ceremony.

695
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Are you ready?

696
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,800
Mm, I am.

697
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,160
If you want to run away from this place,

698
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,360
you can just tell me.

699
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,880
Maybe later.

700
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,840
Let's go, Tycoon Meng.

701
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,880
I...

702
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,560
I have a question about this stock.

703
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,960
I noticed the crash in the market.

704
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,480
Hey...

705
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,600
We're gonna need hours

706
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,520
to discuss this stock.

707
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,720
- Right.
- How about this?

708
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Tonight, after the party is over,

709
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,520
I will give you a thorough explanation.

710
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,920
Sure thing.

711
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
- Let's go, Tycoon Meng.
- Alright.

712
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,520
Uh,

713
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
I have another question, sir.

714
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,370
I'd like to know if you've seen...

715
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,080
Why are you...

716
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,470
asking that?

717
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,440
Oh...

718
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,200
Nothing.

719
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,040
I just heard that

720
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,800
on the big day,

721
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,600
brides and grooms get overwhelmed
with excitement, anxiety, and confusion.

722
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Sometimes,

723
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,640
they just want to run
from the wedding

724
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
because...

725
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,960
once it's done,
there's no turning back.

726
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,120
So,

727
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,360
if you want to run away,

728
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
just tell me.

729
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,880
I'll take you.

730
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,360
Don't worry.

731
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,760
No matter what,
I'm right by your side.

732
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
You can count on me.

733
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,240
After this, there's no turning back?

734
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,560
Mm.

735
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,560
Take my hand, okay?

736
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,920
Before this,
there was a leaked video of this actor,

737
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,760
and they were
Y MART's ambassador for a while.

738
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,560
I don't think this is the right time
to talk about this.

739
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,680
What's going on with you?

740
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
You're acting strange.

741
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,840
Well,

742
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,040
there's nothing strange here.

743
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,200
If so, then cut it.

744
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,440
Tycoon Meng's going to see his son.

745
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,400
Don't ruin the auspicious moment, okay?

746
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,360
This way, Tycoon Meng.

747
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,360
I'm sorry,

748
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,160
but I promised him.

749
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,560
I can't just leave him.

750
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,270
If I did,

751
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,840
what would people say about him?

752
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,070
There are people

753
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,400
who look down on him.

754
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,240
He's gonna...

755
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
be really sad.

756
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,840
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

757
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,040
Can I have
a private time with my fiance?

758
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,240
Where did you find it?

759
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,160
In the hallway.

760
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,480
Come on, let me put it on.

761
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,960
Just follow my lead.

762
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,240
Come rain or shine,

763
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,800
I promise

764
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,440
I won't ever leave you alone.
