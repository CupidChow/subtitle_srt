are standing by outside the city

5
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,570

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,840
I, along with the two mayors,

7
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,270
once again implore you, Brother,

8
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,130
to remove Yun Mu from his position as royal advisor.

9
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,750
Two mayors and ten thousand troops?

10
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,870
Why don't you just ask me to abdicate

11
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,000
so you can become the monarch instead?

12
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,810
It seems you are unwilling, then.

13
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,880
Be careful.

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,510
Uncle, were you trying to send a message

28
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,950
to the mayors of Xiangping and Danyang?

29
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,120
I suppose they're already

It's suspicious.

I felt something was off as soon as they came in.

46

For the sake of your own reputation,

169

you completely disregarded my deep love for Su Ruoshan,

It was just to help him win the hearts of the people

I indeed didn't think it through.

But at that time,

180
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,670
I was only concerned about Mu's willfulness.

181

Was it Yun Mu's willfulness

182
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,950

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,470
you never mentioned the royal advisor position again.

191
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,850
You even deliberately sent me to the remote Cloud City.

192
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,380
Brother, you went back on your words first.

193
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,660
How can I trust you?

194
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:17,720
[Virtue Is Most Essential]
How can I trust you?

195
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,070
[Virtue Is Most Essential]

196
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,270
So you've always felt that I was unfair.
[Virtue Is Most Essential]

197
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,870
[Virtue Is Most Essential]

198
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,550
Shang.
[Virtue Is Most Essential]

199
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,870
[Virtue Is Most Essential]

200
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,730
Today, I'll make things clear for you.
[Virtue Is Most Essential]

201
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,670
Today, I'll make things clear for you.

202
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,120
As the monarch of Dongsheng,

203
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,110
for the future of Dongsheng,

204
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,270
the successor must be chosen based on merit and ability.

205
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,110
When I sent you to Cloud City years ago,

206
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,820
it was to give you experience

207
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,960
so that one day

208
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,650
you could be like me and sit firmly on the throne.

209
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,880
But in these past few years,

210
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,950
all I've heard

211
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,590
was news of you colluding with mayors of various cities,

212
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,130
forming factions for personal gain.

213
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,470
You're full of suspicion towards me, your brother.

214
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,070
How can I feel at ease

215
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,070
entrusting Dongsheng and Mu to you?

216
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,430
Brother, you'd rather give the throne

217
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,290
to your deaf son

218
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,170
than trust your own brother.

219
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,870
"Choosing based on merit and ability?"

220
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,530
That's nothing but an excuse!

221
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,480
Uncle, since you know I'm deaf,

222
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,850
do you know when I became deaf

223
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,240
and why?

224
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,830
Twelve years ago, we were still close as uncle and nephew.

225
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,160
You had just been appointed as the mayor of Cloud City.

226
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,510
While I was proud of you,

227
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,910
I feared you might be lonely having just arrived there.

228
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,040
I specially asked for Father's permission to visit you.

229
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,850
As soon as I entered your mansion,

230
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,870
my every word and action was under your surveillance.

231
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,720
Fearing you might suspect my intentions,

232
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,630
I made an excuse to leave early,

233
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,030
intending to return to Symphony City soon.

234
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,100
But unexpectedly, as soon as I left the city,

235
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,890
I was pursued by assassins acting under your order.

236
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,090
I was hit by a poisoned arrow at that time

237
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,720
and fled into the Green Flash Forest in panic.

238
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,470
Although I luckily survived,

239
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,340
due to the poison in my body,

240
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,100
I lost my hearing in both ears.

241
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,610
Mu,

242
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,960
you told me back then

243
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,390
that you were pursued by assassins,

244
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,760
and that Shang saved you in that critical moment.

245
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,520
Is what he just said true?

246
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,480
Last time,

247
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,650
when I went to Cloud City to select musicians,

248
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,160
you escorted me back to Symphony City

249
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,180
and set up another assassination attempt along the way.

250
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,230
Two months ago,

251
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,750
you sent Huang Fu to my mansion to attempt another assassination.

252
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,420
I have never

253
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,510
mentioned these matters to Father.

254
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,110
For all these incidents,

255
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,240
I left you with a way out and a chance for survival.

256
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,640
Uncle.

257
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,230
Do you dare to admit what you've done?

258
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,410
What if I do?

259
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,050
What if I don't?

260
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,780
But Yun Mu,

261
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,980
I need you to know.

262
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,310
Before Brother arranged your marriage with Shanshan,

263
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,570
I never had any intention of harming you.

264
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,270
As for the assassination attempt in Cloud City 12 years ago,

265
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,460
I was unaware of it beforehand.

266
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,560
It caused you to lose your hearing for many years.

267
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm deeply sorry about that.

268
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,150
All these years,

269
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,340
I never noticed anything unusual about you

270
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,430
nor realized how much you had suffered.

271
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,070
I didn't want you and Mother to worry about this,

272
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,110
so I worked hard to learn lip-reading.

273
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,650
You've really been through a lot.

274
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,190
Uncle,

275
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,710
I never had any intention of competing with you for power.

276
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,350
But you've been opposing me at every turn.

277
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,670
Now, for the future of Dongsheng,

278
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,100
I cannot let you have

279
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,320
the position of royal advisor.

280
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,510
I've lost.

281
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,410
I submit to Your Majesty and the royal advisor's judgment.

282
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,300
Guards.

283
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,400
Yun Shang, Mayor of Cloud City,

284
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,170
attempted rebellion.

285
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,210
His crime deserves death.

286
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,870
However, considering his past merits in protecting Dongsheng,

287
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,670
his merits and faults balance each other.

288
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,930
Yun Shang is hereby demoted to a commoner

289
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,830
and forbidden from entering Symphony City for life.

290
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

291
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,830
Wait.

292
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,810
Su Ruoshan has nothing to do with the rebellion.

293
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,270
Please, Your Majesty...

294
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,150
Su Ruoshan...

295
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,270
Has gone mad,

296
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,940
She disappeared without a trace.

297
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,160
Shanshan...

298
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,820
You may go now.

299
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,270
Father.

300
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,430
I have been deliberately concealing

301
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,470
the fact that I am deaf.

302
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,390
Please punish me as you see fit.

303
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,260
Ruling a kingdom relies on the heart,

304
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,750
not the ears.

305
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,190
Besides, you can't hear now,

306
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080
but your heart

307
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,490
is clearer than anyone else's.

308
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,110
During Yun Shang's rebellion this time,

309
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,260
you anticipated his every move.

310
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,150
Not only did you foil his plans,

311
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,310
but you also protected

312
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,030
all the civilians without a single casualty.

313
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,440
With your courage, strategy, and benevolence,

314
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,670
I believe you will surely make

315
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,870
an excellent ruler.

316
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,270
I will do my utmost

317
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,200
to safeguard the future of Dongsheng.

318
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,790
Such a pity that the music minister's appointment ceremony ended this way.

319
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,520
I had originally planned to use this opportunity

320
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,810
to arrange your marriage with Su Ruofei.

321
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,470
But now,

322
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,970
we'll have to choose another auspicious date.

323
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,700
I appreciate your intentions, Father.

324
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,180
Ruofei and I sincerely love each other.

325
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,310
We don't mind about these formalities.

326
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,830
Whether you arrange our marriage or not,

327
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,030
in my heart,

328
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,520
she is already the royal advisor's wife.

329
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,390
It's finally over.

330
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,790
Their business is finished.

331
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,070
Now it's our turn.

332
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,510
O-our?

333
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,350
That's right.

334
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,780
You said

335
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,360
you'd seriously consider our relationship.

336
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,370
This... this kind of thing...

337
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,500
I... I need some time to think about it.

338
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,370
Alright.

339
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,420
I'll give you time.

340
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,800
Tell me, how long do you need?

341
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,960
The longer, the better.

342
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,630
Fine.

343
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
Then don't bother thinking about it at all.
