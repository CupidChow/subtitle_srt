293
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,050
Sure.

294
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,580
But this is just the table of contents.

295

297
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,010

you barged into my bathing area

322

When facing Young Lord, look directly at him.

348

Such a random rule.

Didn't we agree you wouldn't come past the divider?

Why aren't you lying down to sleep?

00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,580
What's this?

370
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,250
Tie the other end to your wrist.

371

Then if I move,

372
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,140
you'll feel it.

373
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,970
You won't have to sleep sitting.

What if you secretly

377
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,140
untie it in the middle of the night?

378
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,900
I won't tie it.

379
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,580
Then keep sitting there.

380
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,260
I'll tie it.

-Yes.

Beautiful.

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,970
Thank you, Young Lord.

388
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,070
Don't misunderstand.

Go ahead.

393
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,700
What instrument do you want to hear?

394
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,530
Such bold words.

395
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,140

[Spring Cottage Qin Score]

398
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,740
You're messing with me.

399
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,780
How can I play it with wrist bells?

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,590
So the great boss of Green Flash Workshop

401
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,160
can only play ordinary instruments.

402
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,580
It seems I wasn't wrong to shut down

403
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880

404
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,890
What are you saying?

405
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,020
Try it yourself.

406
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,260
How'd you play it wrist bells?

407
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,180
You're making things difficult for me.

408
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,060
Wrist bells can't completely

409
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,820
play out a full melody,

410
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,900
but according to the score,

411
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,020
you can make different bells collide,

412
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,180
creating different tones and rhythms.

413
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,690
Fine.

414
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,340
This won't stump me.

415
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,180
But we had an agreement.

416
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,140
If I agree to be your entertainer,

417
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,780
you'll restore my music status

418
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,860
and let me join Symphony Workshop.

419
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,690
So when

420
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,590
will you hold up your end of the promise?

421
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,380
Relax.

422
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,540
The auditions for Symphony Workshop aren't over.

423
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,890
As for restoring your music status,

424
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,180
that depends on whether you can use these wrist bells

425
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,060
to play these pieces.

426
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,340
Then I think

427
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,020
you'll have to restore my status tonight.

428
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,600
Is it like this?

What possession?

433
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,420
I'm training her

434
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,830
to play different rhythms with wrist bells.

435
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,700
If she can really play these bells

436
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,100
in a fixed rhythm,

437
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,780
she can use a kind of code

438
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,260
to send me messages.

439
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,360
Good idea.

00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,560
But mastering it

441
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,460
sure isn't easy.

442
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,340
I need to think carefully about this code.

443

444
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,020

00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,740
My stomach hurts.

563
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,270
I need to use the restroom.

564
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,900
Use the restroom?

565
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,020
Why are you being so sneaky then?

566
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,900
I just didn't want to disturb you.

567
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,990
I was being so quiet,

568
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,270
yet I still bothered you.

569
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,550
Young Lord.

570
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,450
If it's nothing urgent,

571
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,590
I'll just...

572
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,160
Go ahead.

573
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,890
Bye.

574
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,310
From now on,

575
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,190
this will be my secret practice spot.

576
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,330
Monkey, Biao, Eleven,

577
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,510
don't worry.

578
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,470
Once I meet Madam Yaoshan in Symphony Workshop,

579
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,940
I'll prove to her

580
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,430
the value of unofficial workshops.

581
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,180
Just wait for my good news.

582
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,630
Alright, stop shaking it.

583
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,270
Can I take a break?

584
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,220
Break?

585
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,150
You've been practicing

586
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,430
for so long,

587
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,380
but you can't even play

588
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,630
a complete rhythm.

589
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,980
Do you deserve a break?

590
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,660
Are you blaming me?

591
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,740
Look carefully yourself.

592
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,260
With so many bells,

593
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,990
it's hard to play a regular pattern, okay?

594
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,340
You can test it yourself.

595
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,420
I know it's not easy.

596
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,340
But ask yourself honestly,

597
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,670
have you been slacking off?

598
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,020
I...

599
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,890
What's wrong?

600
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,990
Young Lord.

601
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,850
My stomach really hurts.

602
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,270
I need to use the restroom.

603
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,830
Come back.

604
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,390
Don't you think you've

605
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,940
used the restroom too many times today?

606
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,790
Did you catch some stomach bug?

607
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,020
-Do you need a doctor?
-No, no.

608
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,660
Don't trouble a doctor for such a small matter.

609
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,110
I've to go.

610
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,030
Young Lord.

611
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,670
Restroom again?

612
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,430
It's the third time today.

613
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,800
Is she up to something?

614
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,030
Right.

615
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,230
Young Lord.

616
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,720
Well, Mr. Jin is here.

617
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,260
Mr. Jin?

618
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,050
Prepare tea in Floral Hall.

619
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,270
Who would've thought?

620
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,010
Many yearn to have swarms of fans.

621
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,390
But for Master Jin,

622
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,790
it's a nuisance.

623
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,260
At Symphony Workshop,

624
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,660
I truly can't get a moment's peace.

625
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,670
I'm forced to impose here.

626
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,150
I understand.

627
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,940
But you,

628
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,000
whom many desire to meet,

629
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,350
willingly came to my mansion.

630
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,580
You're naturally welcome.

631
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,750
Xiaoqi.

632
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,710
Have someone clean up a guest room

633
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,060
for Master Jin to stay for now.

634
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,550
Yes.

635
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,260
Come, have some tea.

636
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,660
Thank you so much.

637
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,430
Shake, shake,

638
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,910
shake, shake.

639
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,830
Ruofei.

640
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,780
Mr. Jin?

641
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,370
How'd you know I was here?

642
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,220
This is quite a hidden spot.

643
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,550
They said you were in the backyard.

644
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,710
This is the only spot where someone could hide.

645
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,950
Hold on.

646
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,260
Mr. Jin.

647
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,640
Are you here to see Young Lord?

648
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,270
I've run into some trouble.

649
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,380
I'll be staying at Young Lord's Mansion for a few days.

650
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,210
I thought I'd come say hello to you first.

651
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,870
That's great!

652
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,070
I didn't have time to look for you.

653
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,070
For the past few days,

654
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,030
Young Lord's been forcing me to practice wrist bells.

655
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,670
Wrist bells?

656
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,790
That's an unusual instrument.

657
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,310
Play it for me to hear.

658
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,300
That's it?

659
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,230
Yes.

660
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,310
This thing that can't play a melody.

661
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,150
He makes me practice it for ten hours every day.

662
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,750
Besides sleeping and eating,

663
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,540
I'm practicing all the time.

664
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
Isn't it absurd?

665
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,350
I'd be glad to practice any other instrument,

666
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,230
but isn't it a waste of time

667
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,110
practicing this thing?

668
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,340
Don't be angry.

669
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,910
I brought you something.

670
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
See if you like it.

671
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,350
What is it?

672
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,270
This is a pan flute.

673
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,910
Although it's not easy to play,

674
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,140
it's made of a special material.

675
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,590
It's said to glow at night.

676
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,630
This...

677
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,960
It's so precious.

678
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,590
No, no, I can't accept it.

679
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,120
It's for you. Just take it.

680
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,300
I'll just end up trading it for wine money.

681
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,310
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

682
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,860
You're so nice to me.

683
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,790
Maybe

684
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,620
it's because we're fated.

685
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,190
I don't know why,

686
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,950
but I always feel like I've seen you before.

687
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,350
I know.

688
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,030
Isn't this what they call hitting it off at first sight?

689
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,470
Mr. Jin.

690
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,710
I also find you very amiable.

691
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,100
Don't call me Mr. Jin.

692
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,640
It's too formal.

693
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,630
Then what should I call you?

694
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Call me Shangyu.

695
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,710
Shangyu?

696
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,990
No.

697
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,550
Shangyu reminds me of

698
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,830
my chubby childhood friend.

699
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,510
You can think of me as that chubby boy.

700
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,920
How can I?

701
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,130
Why not?

702
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,820
What if I'm that chubby boy?

703
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,400
That chubby Shangyu

704
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,260
had chubby cheeks

705
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,310
and a face this big.

706
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,470
And his hands

707
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,270
were plump like little balls.

708
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,150
Look at your hands.

709
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,830
Lean and strong,

710
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,500
born to be a musician.

711
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,330
Based on what you said,

712
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,670
you must dislike that chubby boy.

713
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,730
No way.

714
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,910
I don't dislike him.

715
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,270
It's just that he was always bullied when he was little,

716
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,930
and I always protected him.

717
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,980
Now that he's grown up,

718
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,950
I wonder if there's anyone protecting him.

719
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,270
Actually,

720
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,950
I...

721
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,110
Ms. Su?

722
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,150
Ms. Su, where are you?

723
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,540
My break is over.

724
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,590
Mr. Jin, another day...

725
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,220
Shangyu.

726
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,430
Okay, okay, Shangyu.

727
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,870
No one can know about this spot.

728
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,820
This is our secret.

729
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll get going.
