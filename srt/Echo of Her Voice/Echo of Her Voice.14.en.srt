Were you tuning your instrument?

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,590
Yes.

7
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,290
You wanted to see me?

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,480
Young Lord, why don't you listen to me play a piece first?

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,750
Certainly.

10
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,190
I've never heard that piece before.

11
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,690
Is it a new composition of yours?

12
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,330
Yes.

13
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,230
This piece is called "Thoughts of Jasper."

14
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,220
It's specially prepared for this audition.

15
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,230
It's just...

16
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,590

resulted in 10 years of yearning.

20
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,590
One day, a sudden reunion,

21
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,670
two hearts...

22
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,730
I just can't seem to compose

23
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,530
a fitting last segment of the piece,

24
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,240
so I asked you here to help.

00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,430
Although I'm not involved in the final selection,

26
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,360
wouldn't it be unfair to the others

27
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,190
if I help you with the composing?

28
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,230
No,

29
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,590
I just want to ask you

30
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,230
a few questions, that's all.

31
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,070
Feel free to ask.

32
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
I want to know

33
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,630
what this jasper

34
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,870
means to you.

35
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,590
I've been thinking of that jasper youth all this time,

36
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,230
but I don't know if that jasper youth

37
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,670
has ever thought of me.

38
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,740
"Thoughts of Jasper"...

39
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,820
I don't know if the yearning

40
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,900
is one-sided or mutual.

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
If I can't figure this out,

42
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm afraid I won't be able

43
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,900
to compose this piece well.

44
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,790
So I'd like to ask you to enlighten me.

46
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,390
Ruoshan,

47
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,520
you saved me back then.

48
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,890
Actually, all these years, I've been thinking

49
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,490
about how I should repay you.

50
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
The brooch I gave you then

51
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,680
was just a small memento of that time.

52
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,470
Your kindness to me...

53
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,630
I never felt that I did you any favor.

54
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,910
I consider

55
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,800
what happened back then

Come.

00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,110
Your sister just fell asleep.

Don't disturb her.

81
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,920
What happened to her?

82
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,110
Your sister and I were talking in the Huiyin Hall

83
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,230
when suddenly the chandelier fell down

84
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,360
and injured her leg.

85
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,510
The doctor was here just now.

86
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,590
He said fortunately no tendons or bones were injured.

87
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,590
With some rest and recuperation, she should recover.

88
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,280
Why did the chandelier

89
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,310
fall down all of a sudden?

90

The doctor has just been here to examine you.

107
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,850
He said it was fortunate that it only hit your leg.

108
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,450
If it had hit somewhere else,

109
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,940
the consequences would have been unthinkable.

110
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,810
At that moment, I only thought about protecting the jasper.

111
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,810
I didn't think about anything else.

112
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,990
Is this jasper so important to you?

113
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,210

Do you have an answer

119
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,080
to my question now?

120
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,260
Both you and the jasper

121
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,030
are very important to me.

122
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,940
I also cherish our friendship very much.

123
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,020
But this feeling

124
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,880
has nothing to do with romance.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I understand now.

Have you found out the cause?

151
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,990
Young Lord,

152
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,350
the preliminary conclusion is that

153
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,940
it was likely caused by rat gnawing.

154
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,830
Rat gnawing?

155
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,840
How could there be rats in the Symphony Workshop?

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,220
My apologies.

157
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,830
It was my negligence in prevention

158
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,210
that led to this grave mistake.

159
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,870
Please punish me, Young Lord.

160
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,370
This isn't your fault.

161
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,610
After all, who could have imagined

162
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,810
that rats could gnaw down a chandelier?

163
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,220
However, I'll trouble you, Music Minister Ling,

164
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,800
to buy some rat poison and distribute it to everyone

165
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,300
to prevent such incidents from happening again.

166
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,980
Yes.

167
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,600
I will see to it right away.

168

169
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,330
I suspect there's something fishy about this.

170
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm afraid it wasn't an accident.

171
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,420
Actually, I find it strange too.

172
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,470
Why would rats suddenly appear?

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,080
Why are there so many harp strings?

How are you feeling, Shanshan?

183
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,750
Does your leg still hurt?

I wish I could take the pain for you.

The doctor said

188
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,190
I only have some bruising on my leg.

189
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,210
The bone wasn't affected.

190
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,870

How can it be nothing serious?

192
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,930
Even a small injury to you is serious.

193
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,790
These tonics I brought you

194
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,170
are all for strengthening tendons and bones.

195
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,540
They'll help with your recovery.

196
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,800
Remember to take them.

197
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Thank you, Mayor.

198
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,660
From Cloud City to Symphony City,

199
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,460
you've always been so kind to me.

200
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,230
I truly don't know how to repay you.

201
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,330
You're being too formal with me.

202
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,120
Whatever I do for you

203
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,780
is expected of me.

204
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,590
I wonder when my leg will heal.

205
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,740
I don't want to miss this audition.

206
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,100
Just focus on recovering.

207
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,550
Don't think too much about it.

208
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,150
Leave everything else to me.

209
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,150
Then I will rely entirely on you, Mayor.

210
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,120
[Cloud Pavilion]

211
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,970
It's alright, don't worry.

212
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,900
Ruoshan.

213
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,170
Why are you up already?

214
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,850
Young Lord, why are you here?

215
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,990
I just wanted to check on you.

216
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,550
I also brought some tonics.

217
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,850
Your leg has just started to heal.

218
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,510
Why are you out of bed already?

219
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,220
Lying in bed was just too boring.

220
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,590
The Mayor gave me this walking stick,

221
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,870
so I thought I'd practice walking a bit.

222
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,350
That was thoughtful of Uncle.

223
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,470
But your leg only just started healing.

224
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,070
You still need to be careful.

225
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,540
Thank you, Young Lord.

226
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,550
Musician Su.

227
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,990
The Mayor has sent a carriage for you.

228
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,310
Then I'll go with you.

229
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,070
This is your carriage.

230
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,840
Please wait a moment, you two.

231
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,100
I'll go check it again.

232
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,490
My uncle is really thoughtful.

233
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,060
Yes,

234
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,130
the Mayor is very considerate.

235
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,250
What are you doing?

236
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,750
I told you not to touch it!

237
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,160
What's wrong with you?

238
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
What if you dirty the noble's carriage?

239
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,950
This noble's carriage is so expensive.

240
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,350
Our whole family's worthless lives combined

241
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,080
aren't worth as much as this carriage.

242
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,800
If you damage it even a little,

243
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,740
selling you wouldn't cover the cost!

244
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,990
Stop it!

245
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,570
My Lady, I'm so sorry.

246
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,190
Get up.

247
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,730
This brat couldn't keep her hands to herself.

248
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,220
S-She dirtied your carriage.

249
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,010
I-I've already punished her.

250
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,150
It hurts, doesn't it?

251
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,280
Do you like this carriage?

252
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,940
Would you like to ride in it?

253
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,180
Why don't I invite you to ride the carriage with me?

254
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,830
This...

255
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,030
Go ahead.

256
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,510
This...

257
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,390
My Lady, this won't do.

258
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,310
Please, this isn't allowed.

259
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,470
Mere servants like us

260
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,180
dare not ride in a noble's carriage.

261
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,870
Silence!

262
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,850
The carriage is mine.

263
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,100
I decide who gets to

264
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,060
ride in it.

265
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,810
Does it still hurt?

266
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,410
I was once like you.

267
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,600
As long as you work hard,

268
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,430
you can be like me too.

269
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,400
Would you like that?

270
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,440
Thank you for driving the carriage for me today.

271
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,890
I am deeply grateful.

272
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,260
Your actions today

273
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,480
truly impressed me.

274
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,830
You are indeed still that

275
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,960
jasper girl who brings hope to others.

276
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
I merely did what needed to be done.

277
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,400
Young Lord, there's no need for such praise.

278
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,700
It's getting late.

279
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,590
You should go back and rest early.

280
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,160
Young Lord, please rest early as well.

281
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,310
[Su's Mansion]

282
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,040
This carriage is so beautiful.
[Su's Mansion]

283
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,220
[Su's Mansion]

284
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,460
Who told you to touch it?

285
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,770
This is the first young miss's carriage.

286
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,270
The lives of our entire family put together

287
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,030
couldn't afford this carriage.

288
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,340
Even if we sold you,

289
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,200
we couldn't afford even one of its wheels.

290
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,960
How dare you be so bold?

291
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,120
Father.

292
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,450
Why are our lives so worthless?

293
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,520
How many times have I told you?

294
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,410
I...

295
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,740
This is how we were born.

296
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,830
It can't be changed.

297
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,470
I don't believe it. I insist on changing it!

298
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,000
I...

299
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,760
Still talking back?

300
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,950
How dare you say such crazy things?

301
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,960
Just hurry up and grow up so I can marry you off.

302
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,530
After you're married off,

303
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,230
I can keep more money

304
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,840
to drink more wine.

305
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,610
That'll be your way of repaying me.

306
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,010
Do you understand?

307
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,190
Thank you, Sir.

308
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,410
Thank you, Madam.

309
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,000
Thank you, Sir.

310
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,150
Thank you, Madam.

311
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,510
Be careful!

312
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,890
Is the child alright?

313
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,250
[Good weather]
Is the child alright?

314
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,210
[Good weather]

315
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:37,770
Fei.

316
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,630
[Good weather]

317
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,360
Are you okay?
[Good weather]

318
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,600
[Good weather]

319
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,440
We want to adopt you as our child.

320
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,140
From now on, you'll be our daughter.

321
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,240
You'll be Fei's older sister.

322
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,450
From now on, you'll be my real sister.

323
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,430
What's mine is yours.

324
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,030
Thank you.

325
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,390
Your name will be Su Ruoshan.

326
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,840
We're family now.

327
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,390
Oh, Fei.

328
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,890
If you must blame someone,

329
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,210
you can only blame yourself for standing in my way.

330
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,770
[Huiyin Hall]

331
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,830
This assessment will be judged by me,
[Huiyin Hall]

332
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,640
This assessment will be judged by me,

333
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,970
the Mayor of Cloud City,

334
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,540
Lord Liang from the Ministry of Rites,

335
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,620
and Master Jin Shangyu.

336
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,780
The four of us will serve as judges.

337
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,830
Due to the special nature of

338
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,090
the theme "Yearning,"

339
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,230
you can perform solo or as an ensemble.

340
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,440
The best individual or group

341
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,110
will represent the Symphony Workshop

342
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,000
and become this year's ceremonial musician.

343
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,330
Now, let the audition officially begin.

344
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,750
This part of the piece

345
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,280
is very cleverly designed.

346
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,910
What do you think, Master Jin?

347
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,240
They played quite well.

348
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,360
It was a good performance.

349
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,080
[Four] [Three]

350
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,020
[Seven] [Zero]

351
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:18,810
[Five] [Nine]

352
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,950
[Nine]

353
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,160
[Three] [Zero]

354
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,580
[Seven] [One]

355
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,470
[One] [Zero]

356
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,420
Greetings, esteemed judges.

357
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,950
The piece we're presenting today is

358
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,300
"Prelude to Yearning."

359
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,470
At dawn I gaze at the sky, at dusk I watch the clouds.

360
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,000
As I walk, I think of you.

361
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,890
As I sit, I think of you.

362
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,940
You may begin.

363
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,440
As if weeping, as if pleading,

364
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,090
as if complaining, as if yearning.

365
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,320
Like a woman softly whispering her feelings in one's ear.

366
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,350
This "Prelude to Yearning"

367
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,940
is indeed filled with yearning

368
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,470
and sentiment throughout.

369
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,430
Su Ruofei's liuqin playing is melodious and deep,

370
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,980
subtly tugging at the heartstrings.

371
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,050
This child's skill is profound.

372
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,450
What's so special about that?

373
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,030
Let me tell you,

374
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,420
it's only because Su Ruoshan didn't participate.

375
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,140
Otherwise, they wouldn't have stood a chance.

376
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,930
However, I think

377
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,060
this pipa performance is no less impressive than the liuqin.

378
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,640
Alright, alright.

379
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,390
That's because you haven't heard Shanshan play.

380
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,940
Huang Ying's performance

381
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,200
shows more discontent than Su Ruofei's.

382
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,230
It seems that the person she yearns for

383
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,900
has caused her much anguish.

384
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,190
After deliberation among the judges,

385
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,750
we unanimously agree that

386
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,600
the first place goes to

387
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,420
the Qinghe Group represented by Huang Ying.

388
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,950
Excellent!

389
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,100
Wait a moment.

390
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,250
I think this is unfair.

391
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,210
Since this is an open audition,

392
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,070
shouldn't everyone from the Symphony Workshop

393
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,630
be eligible to participate?

394
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,330
Mayor,

395
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,390
we've already explained to you.

396
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,530
It's not that Su Ruoshan isn't allowed to participate.

397
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,710
It's just her leg injury...

398
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,800
Her leg is injured, but her hands are fine.

399
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,670
She can still play the instrument.

400
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,790
She's just having difficulty moving around.

401
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,580
How about this?

402
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,290
I propose

403
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,590
that we go to the Cloud Pavilion

404
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,890
and give her a separate audition.

405
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,690
That would be fair, wouldn't it?

406
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,960
Well...

407
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,110
A separate audition might not be in line with the rules.

408
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,750
What's not in line with the rules?

409
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,150
Rules are made by people.

410
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,460
Mu, do you think it's against the rules?

411
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
It is indeed a pity that Su Ruoshan

412
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,570
couldn't participate.

413
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,740
However, Uncle,

414
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,110
we've just selected

415
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,790
the Qinghe Group as the winner.

416
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,900
If we disregard that,

417
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,360
it wouldn't be fair to them either, would it?

418
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,460
Yes.

419
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,390
Well, Su Ruofei, what do you say?

420
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,510
Think about it.

421
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,260
Your sister has always been so good to you.

422
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,710
Can you bear to let her miss the competition?

423
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,040
Winning like this wouldn't be honorable.

424
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,350
-Well…
-You can’t agree.

425
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,880
We earned our victory.

426
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,340
How can they just disregard it like that?

427
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,560
That's right, Ruofei.

428
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,130
This is about being the ceremony musician.

429
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,790
It's a matter of family honor.

430
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,080
Look at how small-minded you all are.

431
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,790
Su Ruoshan hasn't even played, and you're already afraid we'd lose?

432
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,010
I don't believe that

433
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,510
she can beat our "Prelude to Yearning."

434
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,950
Right, Ruofei?

435
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,470
Music Minister Ling,

436
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,670
esteemed officials,

437
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,110
we are willing to let musician Su Ruoshan

438
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,630
compete with us again.

439
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,780
Good.

440
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,490
Good.

441
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,010
Since you have such an open mind,

442
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,100
we'll make an exception this time

443
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,560
and re-evaluate Su Ruoshan.

444
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,830
I'll go notify Su Ruoshan right away

445
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,230
and tell her to get ready.

446
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,170
Minister Ling,

447
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,550
let me go instead.

448
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,470
Alright.

449
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,110
Everyone has worked hard these past few days.

450
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,370
Go back and rest early.

451
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,230
Yes.

452
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:20,830
[Cloud Pavilion]

453
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,300
Sister, are you there?
[Cloud Pavilion]

454
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,630
[Cloud Pavilion]

455
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,060
Minister Ling asked me to come
[Cloud Pavilion]

456
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,990
Minister Ling asked me to come

457
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,510
discuss the evaluation matter

458
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,660
with you.

459
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,480
Come in.

460
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,360
Sister,

461
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,380
why is it so dark in your room?

462
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,870
I'm just...

463
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,320
Are you alright?

464
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,590
It's nothing.

465
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,020
Could you pour me a glass of water?

466
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,790
I'm sorry.

467
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,470
I knocked over your oil jar.

468
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,560
It's okay.

469
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,510
But it's not easy to borrow lamp oil.

470
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,990
I'll go ask the manager for some.

471
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,160
Don't rush.

472
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,840
The Symphony Workshop is very strict about lamp oil.

473
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,260
If you go borrow it so rashly,

474
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,920
you definitely won't get any.

475
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,920
How about this?

476
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,860
Help me borrow some from everyone else.

477
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,230
They'll surely spare me some

478
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,670
out of respect for me.

479
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,020
I'll go ask Shangyu for some.

480
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,820
No, you can't.

481
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,750
Master Jin is of a different rank than us.

482
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,880
How can we borrow from him so casually?

483
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,610
Go ask Tang Xue instead.

484
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,530
Then wait for me to freshen up.

485
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,020
After I'm done, we'll talk more when you get back.

486
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,670
Okay.

487
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,030
Drink more hot water then.

488
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,560
Alright.

489
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,330
[Upright and Pleasant]

490
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,430
Who is it?

491
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,430
You?

492
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,200
What are you doing here?

493
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,270
Can you spare me some lamp oil?

494
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,960
No, I can't.

495
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,560
It's for my sister.

496
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,060
Musician Su?

497
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,000
What does she need lamp oil for?

498
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,690
I accidentally spilled her lamp oil.

499
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,530
If we ask the manager for more,

500
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,730
we'll be punished.

501
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,700
So...

502
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,150
Can you spare me some?

503
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,210
Wait a moment then.

504
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:58,910
Thank you.

505
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,070
Sister,

506
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,030
I've borrowed the lamp oil.

507
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,230
Thank you for your trouble. Put it down.

508
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,350
Sister.

509
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,780
Are you alright?

510
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,420
I'm fine.

511
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,210
I might have caught a cold.

512
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,830
How's your leg?

513
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,260
Much better.

514
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,940
By the way,

515
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,920
you said that Minister Ling wants me to take the test.

516
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,980
What's that about?

517
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,430
Well,

518
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,490
it's about the ceremony musician selection this time.

519
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,800
The mayor of Cloud City thinks you should participate.

520
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,990
So Minister Ling decided

521
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,750
to let you take a separate test.

522
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,920
So for this selection,

523
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,670
who was originally the winner?

524
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,130
It was us.

525
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,160
Given your skills, it's not surprising.

526
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,060
But they wanted me to take the test

527
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,920
and you agreed?

528
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,230
Of course.

529
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,930
I actually hope to have

530
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,810
a fair competition with you, too.

531
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,560
Aren't you afraid I'll take your first place?

532
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,640
Or do you think

533
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,270
I'll definitely lose to you?

534
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,730
Just like how I lost the Young Lord to you?

535
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,690
Sister,

536
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,960
how can you compare these two things?

537
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,930
Besides, matters of the heart

538
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,480
are always about mutual feelings.

539
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,910
There's no winning or losing in love.

540
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,750
Yes,

541
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,150
in matters of the heart,

542
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,350
it's all about mutual feelings.

543
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,540
Who can I blame?

544
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,480
Sister,

545
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,840
I didn't want things to turn out this way either.

546
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,900
I also hope that we sisters

547
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,260
shouldn't be at odds because of this.

548
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,790
If that's the case,

549
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,050
why don't you give up the Young Lord to me?

550
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,110
You want your sister,

551
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,430
and you want your lover too.

552
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,990
Fei,

553
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,780
don't you think you're being too greedy?

554
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,630
Does the whole world have to cater to you

555
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,300
and go along with your wishes?

556
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,070
That's not what I meant.

557
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,310
Alright,

558
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,320
since I'm going to participate in the selection,

559
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,720
I need to go practice now.

560
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,200
Sister, please be careful.

561
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,650
Come on.

562
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,030
Sister.

563
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,790
-Let’s…
-Alright.

564
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,430
If you want to talk,

565
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,360
wait for me in the instrument room at dusk.

566
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,220
It's closest to where I practice.

567
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,540
Alright,

568
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,170
I'll see you at dusk then.

569
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,390
[Instrument Room]

570
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,180
Sister.
[Instrument Room]

571
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,700
[Instrument Room]

572
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,460
Why isn't she here yet?

573
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,860
Help!

574
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,590
The instrument room is on fire!

575
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,480
-Why is it on fire? Yeah.
-What happened?

576
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,210
It's on fire! Quick, put it out!

577
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,350
I just arrived and saw the fire inside.

578
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,450
You were the only one here.

579
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,550
You didn't start the fire, did you?

580
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,270
[Instrument Room]

581
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,030
It wasn't me.
[Instrument Room]

582
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,110
It caught fire just as I arrived.
[Instrument Room]

583
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,900
How is that possible?
[Instrument Room]

584
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,880
-You're the only one here.
-What's going on?
[Instrument Room]

585
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,870
-You're the only one here.
-What's going on?

586
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,760
Musical Director,

587
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,590
when we just arrived,

588
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,780
She was the only one who came out from inside.

589
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,160
I suspect she started the fire.

590
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Everyone, hurry and put out the fire!

591
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,650
Are there any other people around?

592
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,330
No.

593
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,630
She was the only one who came out from inside.

594
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,610
It wasn't me.

595
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,290
Take her to Huiyin Hall first.

596
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,290
Sister.

597
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:31,750
Let's go.

598
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,470
I didn't do it.

599
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,390
-It wasn't me.
-Let's go.

600
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,430
I didn't do it!

601
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,790
[Huiyin Hall]

602
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,410
Su Ruofei.
[Huiyin Hall]

603
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:37,550
Su Ruofei.

604
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,950
Did you start the fire?

605
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,840
It wasn't me.

606
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,590
Let go of her.

607
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,080
Ruofei.

608
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Shangyu.

609
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,400
Are you alright?

610
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,920
What exactly happened?

611
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,430
Master Jin.

612
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,780
Su Ruofei set fire to the instrument room

613
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,220
and was caught red-handed by us.

614
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,340
I didn't do it.

615
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,060
I had arranged to meet my sister

616
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,470
at the instrument room.

617
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,080
We did agree to meet at dusk.

618
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,550
But Minister Ling and I

619
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,920
were discussing the assessment,

620
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,030
so we were delayed.

621
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,990
Yes.

622
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,830
We only rushed over when we heard

623
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,860
about the fire.

624
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,790
Ruofei.

625
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,020
What time did you arrive?

626
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,790
I arrived just a little earlier than them.

627
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,440
The fire started right after I got there.

628
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,520
I called for people to put out the fire.

629
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,600
Instead, they arrested me.

630
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,200
Ruofei.

631
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,530
When you arrived,

632
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,900
was anyone else there?

633
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,030
What's going on?

634
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,000
I heard the instrument room caught fire.

635
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,060
Who is it?

636
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,940
Who dared to set fire in Symphony Workshop?

637
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,750
Greetings, Mayor.

638
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,280
Have you caught the person?

639
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,290
Did you start the fire?

640
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,380
The matter still needs investigation.

641
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,030
I believe it wasn't Ruofei who started the fire.

642
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,710
Mayor.

643
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,030
Fei and I arranged to meet at the instrument room.

644
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,700
But when the fire started,

645
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,830
she was the only one present.

646
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,450
Mayor.

647
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,240
However, I believe

648
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,670
that Fei definitely didn't start the fire.

649
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,210
Regardless,

650
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,480
Su Ruofei is still the prime suspect.

651
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,370
Guards.

652
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,200
Take her to the Supervisory Office.

653
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,000
-Mayor Yun.
-Supervisory Office...

654
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,550
The matter hasn't been cleared up yet.

655
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,210
Taking Ruofei to the Supervisory Office now

656
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,410
seems a bit inappropriate, doesn't it?

657
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,840
I don't need you to tell me how to do my job.

658
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,120
If anyone else dares to interfere,

659
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,580
take them to the Supervisory Office as well.

660
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,650
Stop right there!

661
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,020
As long as I'm here today,

662
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,370
no one is taking Su Ruofei away.

663
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,810
Shangyu.

664
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,690
You don't need to worry about me.

665
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,860
I have a clear conscience and fear no accusation.

666
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,050
I will go to the Supervisory Office when the time comes

667
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,280
and explain everything to them.

668
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,540
That's right, Master Jin.

669
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,740
Don't be rash.

670
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,350
If this matter really escalates,

671
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,480
even if Su Ruofei is innocent, it will be hard to explain.

672
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,380
That's right.

673
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,430
As long as we can find

674
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,830
evidence to prove Fei's innocence.

675
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,760
Of course, we can give her justice.

676
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,030
Mayor.

677
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,030
Please don't be hard on Fei.

678
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,540
Don't worry.

679
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,690
Please proceed.

680
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,440
[Supervisory Office]

681
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,320
Are you worried about how to judge this case, sir?

682
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,620
The case itself is not complicated.

683
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,030
But the problem is that Su Ruofei

684
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,510
was originally an entertainer at the Young Lord's Mansion.

685
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,380
And I heard that recently at the Symphony Workshop,

686
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,640
the Young Lord kissed her in public

687
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,270
and said she was the one he loved most.

688
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,460
In that case,

689
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,270
she might be the Young Lord's future wife.

690
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,860
If I misjudge this case,

691
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,620
my career as an official will be over.

692
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,390
You don't need to worry, sir.

693
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,820
As you said,

694
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,480
Su Ruofei and the Young Lord are very close.

695
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,270
If something happens to her,

696
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,190
how could the Young Lord not care?

697
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,540
You mean we should wait for the Young Lord to come

698
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,940
and see what he has to say?

699
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,670
The Young Lord has arrived.

700
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:36,880
Young Lord.

701
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,700
Greetings, Young Lord.

702
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,140
Please rise, Supervisory Inspector.

703
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,470
Young Lord, please take the seat of honor.

704
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,410
No need.

705
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,830
May I ask why you're visiting tonight?

706
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,050
Do you have any instructions?

707
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,650
I heard that Su Ruofei was brought here.

708
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,830
Have you questioned her yet, sir?

709
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,830
To be honest,

710
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,760
this is a serious matter.

711
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,420
I haven't questioned her yet.

712
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,190
It seems the case is somewhat complicated then.

713
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,430
Well...

714
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,450
Young Lord,

715
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,760
this case is not complicated.

716
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,220
It's just that Su Ruofei is deeply involved,

717
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,140
so a judgment cannot be hastily made.

718
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,500
We were about to go to your mansion to seek guidance.

719
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,130
Yes.

720
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,020
I was about to seek your guidance.

721
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,620
Inspector, you are indeed experienced in officialdom.

722
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,100
You've considered everything thoroughly.

723
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,390
Since I'm here,

724
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,260
I'll trouble you to start the questioning now.

725
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,870
Yes.

726
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,330
Then I'll have someone bring the suspect here now.

727
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:31,890
No need.

728
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,120
We'll see her directly in the jail.

729
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,160
-Let’s go.
-Yes.

730
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,510
Then, I'll begin the interrogation.

731
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,720
Ms. Su, please,

732
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,750
what was the situation at that time?

733
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,750
Sir.

734
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,130
At that time, my sister and I

735
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,220
had arranged to meet at the instrument room at dusk.

736
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,350
I arrived first.

737
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,740
When I got there,

738
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,840
a fire suddenly broke out.

739
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,030
I was about to try to put out the fire,

740
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,300
but I was mistaken for the arsonist

741
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,560
and brought here instead.

742
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,210
So you're saying the fire started at dusk?

743
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,200
Did you see anyone else there at that time?

744
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,160
No.

745
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,860
In other words,

746
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,280
no one can prove

747
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,110
what you were doing at that time.

748
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,230
However, this doesn't prove

749
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,690
that you started the fire.

750
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,790
We just need to find

751
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,540
evidence related to the arson.

752
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,500
Young Lord,

753
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
what do you think?

754
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,050
You make a good point, Inspector.

755
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,050
I'll help look for evidence as well.

756
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,730
As for Su Ruofei,

757
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,420
I hope you can take good care of her.

758
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,260
Understood.

759
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,630
Ms. Su will feel

760
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,900
at home here.

761
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,990
No, no.

762
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,100
I mean,

763
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,320
I will definitely take good care of her.

764
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,590
Don't worry.

765
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,480
I will definitely find evidence.

766
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,210
Just wait for me patiently.

767
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,590
What's the use of Minister Ling

768
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,650
letting us in here?

769
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,760
This place has been burned to a crisp.

770
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,680
What evidence can we find?

771
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,470
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

772
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,430
I won't give up.

773
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,880
You care about her the most.

774
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,010
Even Young Lord doesn't seem as anxious as you.

775
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,410
Who says I'm not anxious?

776
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,790
I didn't expect you two

777
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,950
to arrive before me.

778
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,750
Have you found anything?

779
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,590
The Supervisory Office came to investigate last night.

780
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,240
If there were any evidence,

781
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,070
would they have missed it?

782
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,050
Do you think so too, Mr. Jin?

783
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,440
Apart from storing

784
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,750
the musicians' instruments,

785
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,570
this room also housed many famous instruments.

786
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,810
Whether it's the building materials

787
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,940
or the house design,

788
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,990
they've maximized fire resistance and heat tolerance.

789
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,740
Yesterday's fire was big and fierce.

790
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,300
I believe the arsonist

791
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,890
must have used some accelerant.

792
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,690
If we can find that accelerant,

793
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,400
it might prove Ruofei's innocence.

794
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,050
Now that you mention it,

795
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,660
I think I smelled something just now.

796
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,100
It seems like telosma.

797
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,260
Lamp oil?

798
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,560
My mother loves telosma the most.

799
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,450
Since she became the music minister,

800
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,040
all the lamp oil in Symphony Workshop

801
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,770
has been infused with telosma.

802
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,150
So the culprit used lamp oil as an accelerant.

803
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,010
But how does this prove Su Ruofei's innocence?

804
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,010
Couldn't she have used lamp oil too?

805
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,620
Symphony Workshop has always emphasized fire prevention.

806
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,320
The lamp oil and kindling material are strictly controlled.

807
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,910
The ratio of lamp oil and kindling material for each dormitory

808
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,990
is limited,

809
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,550
and they are kept by designated personnel.

810
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,300
Ruofei has never lived in Symphony Workshop,

811
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,630
so she never had the chance

812
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,890
to access the lamp oil.

813
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,130
In that case,

814
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,330
the culprit must be someone from Symphony Workshop.

815
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,350
But the scent dissipated overnight.

816
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,950
It's not really an evidence.

817
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,000
Huang Ying,

818
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,180
you have a keen sense of smell.

819
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,070
Can you help me sniff around

820
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,670
to find out exactly where the lamp oil was poured?

821
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,800
My nose is precious.

822
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,270
How can I use it for this?

823
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,550
Unless...

824
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,510
Unless what?

825
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,280
Look at you two, so anxious.

826
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,630
Unless you

827
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,750
beg me.

828
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,680
Alright.

829
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,320
Then I sincerely request you, Ms. Huang,

830
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,930
to help me find evidence of where the lamp oil was poured.

831
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,860
If you need anything in the future,

832
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,640
I will do my utmost to help you.

833
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,580
Huang Ying,

834
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,810
I also earnestly request you.

835
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,850
As long as you can help prove Ruofei's innocence,

836
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,270
I...

837
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,290
Why don't you offer yourself to her?

838
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,010
Anything but that.

839
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,450
Anything else is fine.

840
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,610
Alright.

841
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,420
There must be lamp oil on this.

842
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,660
That's it.

843
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,170
Now we just need to find out

844
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,390
whose lamp oil stock has been depleted

845
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,320
without record.

846
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,590
That person must be the arsonist.
