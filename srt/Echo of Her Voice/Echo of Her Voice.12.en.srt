189
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,510
we have one last question.

190
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,710
Will you ever be done?

191
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,900
How many 'last questions' have there been already?

192
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,340
Can't you let Master Jin

193
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,310
get some rest?

194
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,040
It's alright. Go ahead and ask.

195
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,790
We entered the Symphony Workshop

196
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,120
based on our own merits.

197
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,310
But every time we perform together,

198
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,220
we can't seem to get it right.

199
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,350
Could Master Jin please enlighten us?

200
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,370
Yes, yes, that's right.

201
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,420
The most important thing in ensemble playing is rapport.

202
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,930
It's about spiritual harmony.

203
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,490
It's...

204
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,790
Pay attention.

205
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,470
Rather than just telling you,

206
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,480
why don't I perform a duet with someone

207
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,710
to demonstrate for you?

208
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,890
I hope you'll be able to grasp something from it.

209
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,550
Great, great!

210
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,320
Pick me, pick me, pick me!

211
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,390
An ensemble, huh?

212
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,190
Individual practice definitely won't be enough.

213
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,710
We still need to practice together as a group.

214
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,310
Ruofei.

215
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,730
Me?

216
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,870
This won't work, will it?

217
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,930
We haven't even practiced properly.

218
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,270
Our rapport doesn't need practice.

219
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,450
Please, shall we?

220
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,250
Alright then.

221
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,370
Isn't Su Ruofei under Young Lord's care?

222
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,810
How come even Master Jin favors her so much?

223
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
What kind of tactics did she use?

224
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,290
Exactly.

225
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,070
She usually doesn't seem very smart,

226
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,650
but she's actually quite impressive.

227
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,690
Young Lord.

228
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,150
Why is it you?

229
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,430
[Mutual Yearning]

230
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,130
Young Lord,

231
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,290
you're holding the book upside down.

232
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,740
Why hasn't she returned yet?

233
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,830
Send someone to ask

234
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,910
where she is now.

235
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,830
Young Lord,

236
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,830
please don't worry.

237
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,950
Worry?

238
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,090
Do I look worried to you?

239
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,270
A little bit.

240
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,360
How was her situation over there today?

241
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,030
The secret guards reported that

242
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,470
today at the Symphony Workshop,

243
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,400
Mr. Jin went to the Qinghe Group to teach personally.

244
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,190
After class, he and Su Ruofei

245
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,920
went to Breeze Pavilion alone.

246
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,790
They only left in the evening.

247
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,500
Su Ruofei only took a carriage back at nightfall.

248
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,250
She should be arriving soon.

249
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,910
Mr. Jin...

250
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,070
Young Lord,

251
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,480
it seems she's back.

252
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,380
She's back?

253
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,100
Young Lord, Young Lord.

254
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,220
Wait.

255
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,870
How do I look?

256
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,510
Handsome.

257
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,780
Go get the letter of commitment.

258
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,270
Greetings, Young Lord.

259
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,670
Is there something you need?

260
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,870
Xiaoqi.

261
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,190
I, Su Ruofei,

262
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,690
solemnly promise that

263
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,440
I will never go to Jin Shangyu at night in the future.

264
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,370
I will be mindful

265
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,900
of the propriety between men and women,

266
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,450
and uphold the reputation of the Young Lord's Mansion.

267
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,650
Otherwise, I will submit to the Young Lord's punishment.

268
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,870
Why are you reciting the letter of commitment here?

269
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,780
Besides, I didn't go to Shangyu at night.

270
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,850
I will be mindful of the propriety between men and women,

271
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,910
and uphold the reputation of the Young Lord's Mansion.

272
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,460
What does that mean?

273
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,020
Are you playing dumb with me?

274
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,460
Did Jin Shangyu go to the Qinghe Group today?

275
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,930
Did you go to the Breeze Pavilion?

276
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,880
How did you know Shangyu visited our group?

277
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,150
Did you send someone to spy on me?

278
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,980
Spy?

279
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,040
The entire Symphony Workshop belongs to my family.

280
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,750
Moreover,

281
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,690
any sort of news

282
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,360
will reach my ears.

283
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,470
You're the first person I've ever seen

284
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,470
who can speak of such despicable acts so righteously.

285
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,740
I'm a bit tired from practicing all day today.

286
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,260
I'll go back to rest first.

287
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,430
Wait.

288
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,410
Look at her.

289
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,330
She's like this after just one day there.

290
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,330
It must be Jin Shangyu's influence.

291
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,990
I really can't allow

292
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,910
them to be alone together.

293
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,230
Jin Shangyu.

294
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,830
This guy is really troublesome.

295
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,430
Always hanging around Little Ears

296
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,470
like her shadow.

297
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,760
It's probably impossible to transfer him

298
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,650
out of the Symphony Workshop now.

299
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,830
Why are you turning and tossing around so much?

300
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,290
I forgot he can't hear.

301
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,210
I'm warning you,

302
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,830
don't toss and turn when you sleep from now on.

303
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,300
You'll wake me up like this.

304
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,500
Even if you don't sleep, I need to sleep.

305
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,420
Also,

306
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,360
stop sending people to spy on me.

307
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,030
Shangyu and I are just friends.

308
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,440
I have freedom in the Symphony Workshop.

309
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,240
So you're saying you don't want to listen to me,

310
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,240
and you still want to be around Jin Shangyu?

311
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,840
Shangyu

312
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,390
is a highly respected master musician.

313
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,250
He's also my good friend.

314
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,070
When I'm with him,

315
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,550
we can practice music together.

316
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,190
It helps with learning.

317
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,820
It's all above board.

318
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,660
Why are you staring at me?

319
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,270
It seems yesterday's incident

320
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
doesn't bother you at all.

321
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,880
Fine, very well.

322
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,070
Where are you going

323
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,130
at such a late hour?

324
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,620
I suddenly remembered I have some important business to attend to.

325
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,420
I won't disturb your sleep then.

326
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,230
Also,

327
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,830
I sent people to be around you

328
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,250
to protect your safety.

329
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,440
It's not what you think.

330
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,510
Could he be

331
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,550
angry and jealous?

332
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,820
Impossible.

333
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,550
He still has his old flame.

334
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,910
I must find a chance

335
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,670
to go to the study and see

336
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,490
who exactly is in that painting.

337
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,420
I need to know what the woman he fell for

338
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,990
looks like.

339

[Young Lord's Mansion]

340
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,770
Who is it?

341
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,080
It's me, Haitang.

342
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,640
Come in.

343
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,080
Ms. Su.

344
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,240
Here's your breakfast.

345
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,990
The Young Lord asked me to inform you that

346
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,630
he and Xiaoqi have some important business to attend to.

347
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,460
You can have breakfast by yourself.

348
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,580
Also, here are some fruits offered as tribute from foreign states.

349
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,710
The Young Lord specifically instructed me

350
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,240
to bring them for you to try.

351
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,990
I see.

352
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,120
Thank you, Haitang.

353
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,570
It's so lavish.

354
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,190
It's so sweet.

355
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,860
This guy couldn't really be sulking, could he?

356
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,910
What a petty guy.

357
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,220
It's delicious.

358
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,590
Wait.

359
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,040
I can't be won over by just a few pieces of melon.

360
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,940
No way.

[Quyin Hall]

363
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,140
I've gathered everyone here

364
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,550
for a very important announcement.

365
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,640
I've just received the news

366
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,830
that His Majesty wants to select an outstanding musician

367
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,710
from among all of you

368
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,660
to perform at the upcoming Heaven Worship Ceremony.

369
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,560
-The Heaven Worship Ceremony?
-That's great!

370
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,620
That's wonderful!

371
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
What is this Heaven Worship Ceremony?

372
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,240
Is it important?

373
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,310
The Heaven Worship Ceremony

374
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,380
is something only a music director is qualified to preside over.

375
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Now they're choosing from among us,

376
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,800
isn't that basically like selecting a music director?

377
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,600
-I see.
-If you become a music director,

378
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,660
you may be the music minister in the future.

379
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,190
Exactly!

380
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,990
It's like being predetermined.

381
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,670
This is really great!

382
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,470
We must seize this opportunity.

383
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,860
Let's practice hard right away.

384
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,830
I need to think carefully about this.

385
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,890
Alright, alright.

386
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,520
I know everyone is excited

387
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,850
after hearing the news.

388
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,820
So you must make the most of your time

389
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,750
and work hard to improve your musical skills.

390
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,980
Now, let's welcome

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,870
the Young Lord who will oversee this selection process

392
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,130
to announce the theme for the selection.

393
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,670
Greetings, Young Lord.

394
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,780
As Minister Ling said,

395
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,470
I have been entrusted by my mother

396
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,710
to oversee the selection of musicians for this ceremony.

397
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,070
I have also discussed things with Lord Liang and Minister Ling.

398
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,750
The theme for this selection

399
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,100
will be "Yearning".

400
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,120
I hope all musicians can demonstrate their abilities

401
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,270
and bring more brilliant interpretations

402
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,070
to this theme.

403
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,150
Although I won't be involved in the final judging,

404
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,620
before it ends,

405
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,810
I will stay at the Symphony Workshop

406
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,570
and spend time with all of you.

407
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,270
I hope you will all work hard.

408
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I look forward to your performance.

409
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,860
Huang Ying isn't here,

410
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,240
so I'll temporarily assist with your practice.

411
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,870
I actually hope Huang Ying gets confined for a couple more days.

412
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,990
This way, Master Jin,

413
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,610
you can keep practicing with us.

414
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,790
Yes, Master Jin,

415
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,790
why don't you just join our group?

416
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,200
That's right!

417
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,920
I understand.

418
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,230
Huang Ying has a peculiar personality,

419
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,400
and you have issues with her.

420
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,660
I can understand that.

421
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,650
But she is still your group member.

422
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,670
I still hope you can be more united.

423
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,340
After all, good cooperation

424
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,540
leads to good performance, doesn't it?

425
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,490
We understand the principle.

426
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,550
But Master Jin...

427
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,700
Huang Ying...

428
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,220
Is hard to work with.

429
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,130
Although Huang Ying has a rough temper,

430
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,010
her heart is very pure.

431
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,870
When she returns from confinement,

432
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,540
we'll work on getting along better.

433
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,300
Don't worry.

434
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,050
Alright.

435
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,940
Let's start practicing.

436
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,300
-Go back and practice.
-Young Lord.

437
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,030
No need to see me off.

438
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,190
Come join us.

439
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,520
Young Lord, Young Lord.

440
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,150
Why are there so many people?

441
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,920
Don't tell me they're here for Shangyu again.

442
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,870
This is too much.

443
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,150
I'll go send them away.

444
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,200
It seems the Young Lord has arrived.

445
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,060
The Young Lord?

446
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,800
Let's go take a look.

447
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,440
Alright.

448
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,440
Young Lord, Young Lord.

449
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,070
Alright.

450
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:01,470
Everyone, there's no need to see me off anymore.

451
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,650
[Qinghe Room]
Everyone, there's no need to see me off anymore.

452
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:02,670
[Qinghe Room]

453
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,790
Hurry back to practice.
[Qinghe Room]

454
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,190
It's a rare opportunity.
[Qinghe Room]

455
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,350
[Qinghe Room]

456
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,840
Young Lord,
[Qinghe Room]

457
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,010
Young Lord,

458
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,780
are you here to supervise our performance?

459
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,310
Would you like to start with us?

460
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,080
That won't be necessary.

461
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,740
I'm here for the Qinghe Group.

462
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,700
The Qinghe Group?

463
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,460
Why are you here for the Qinghe Group, Young Lord?

464
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,640
Mr. Jin, you're here too.

465
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,330
The Qinghe Group is lacking one member.

466
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,820
I'm here to help them practice.

467
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,450
May I ask why you are here?

468
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,630
To teach.

469
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,510
To teach? What is this little devil

470
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,120
up to now?

471
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,720
What's going on with this Qinghe Group?

472
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,140
Both the Young Lord and Master Jin are here to teach.

473
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,330
It can't possibly be for the two of them.

474
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,050
It must be for that Su Ruofei.

475
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,480
Who is this Su Ruofei anyway?

476
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,770
What's with the special attention?

477
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,570
She's the Young Lord's most favored entertainer.

478
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,170
Seems she's quite something.

479
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Young Lord, you're the supervisor of this selection.

480
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,880
If you only teach the Qinghe Group,

481
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,430
it's a bit unfair, isn't it?

482
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,030
Mr. Jin, you favor only the Qinghe Group

483
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,380
and exclusively practice with them.

484
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,970
Isn't that also unfair?

485
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,790
Oh no.

486
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,370
He's not trying to get back at me, is he?

487
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,690
No wonder he didn't come back to sleep yesterday.

488
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,550
Turns out he was in the study cooking up some scheme.

489
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,510
No, no.

490
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,250
I can't stay here.

491
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,380
It's too dangerous.

492
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,140
I am not being unfair.

493
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,530
If anyone else has any questions,

494
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,150
I can answer them as well.

495
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,980
You hear him, everyone.

496
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,720
Mr. Jin said you can ask him questions anytime.

497
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,880
Hurry and ask him.

498
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,960
Great, let's go!

499
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,000
Young Lord,

500
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,750
why don't you join us?

501
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,260
Sure.

502
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,390
Master Jin,

503
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,690
I have a question I'd like to ask you.

504
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,590
Please, go ahead.

505
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,630
Actually, Master Jin,

506
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,310
I... I want to ask you...

507
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,010
what kind of girls do you like?

508
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,790
We want to know too.

509
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,890
What does this question

510
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,210
have to do with music theory?

511
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,610
It has nothing to do with music theory.

512
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,250
But it matters to us.

513
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,650
That's right.

514
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,730
We want to know.

515
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,650
That's right, Master Jin,

516
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,250
what kind of girl do you like?

517
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,910
The girl I like

518
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,850
wears a jiegu drum headdress

519
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
and bracelets on her wrists.

520
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,540
Her eyebrows curve when she smiles.

521
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,020
As for her personality, she's straightforward

522
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,990
and quirky.

523
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,310
It sounds like

524
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,390
Su Ruofei.

525
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,110
It sounds exactly like Su Ruofei.

526
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,870
Su Ruofei?

527
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,810
We can't count on Master Jin anymore.

528
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,940
What about you, Young Lord?

529
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,490
How about you?

530
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,110
What kind of girl do you like?

531
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,870
Yes, yes.

532
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,550
That's right.

533
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,110
Yes, Young Lord.

534
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,190
What a coincidence.

535
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,250
I like the same type as Mr. Jin.

536
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,060
No way.

537
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,630
That's quite a coincidence.

538
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,830
I hope the girl we like

539
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,090
isn't the same person.

540
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,930
Otherwise, given my personality,

541
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,530
I won't give up on the person I like.

542
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,600
So what if we like the same person?

543
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,040
I'm determined to win her.

544
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,810
Young Lord.

545
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,050
Did you find her?

546
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,850
I did find her,

547
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,190
but she has a message for you.

548
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,150
Let's hear it.

549
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,910
She said,

550
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,070
"Go back to where you came from."

551
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,390
"Don't meddle."

552
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,530
She's really mischievous, isn't she?

553
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,760
She wants me to coax her in person?

554
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,110
Oh well.

555
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,210
I dote on her after all.

556
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,500
Mr. Jin,

557
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,010
I'll take my leave now.

558
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,710
Coax her?

559
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,550
She's really audacious.

560
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,280
She told me to go back to where I came from?

561
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,440
Come here.

562
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,910
Did she really say that?

563
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,170
Then where is she now?

564
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,620
She might be hiding somewhere.

565
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,590
Young Lord,

566
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,360
Ms. Su is here.

567
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,570
At least she has some conscience.

568
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,550
Ruoshan.

569
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,230
Greetings, Young Lord.

570
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,630
No need for formalities.

571
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,920
I just heard

572
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,930
that you went to teach the Qinghe Group.

573
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,070
Are you done instructing Ruofei and the others?

574
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,220
I wouldn't call it instructing.

575
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,280
I just went to appreciate their work.

576
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,630
However, that mischievous sister of yours

577
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,880
skipped class,

578
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,440
so I went there for nothing.

579
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,030
That girl

580
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,000
causes trouble wherever she goes.

581
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,420
I'm sorry to have troubled you, Young Lord.

582
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,090
Since she's under my care,

583
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,340
it's only right that I look after her.

584
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,100
I composed a new piece a few days ago.

585
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,550
It happens to be on the theme of yearning.

586
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,970
I wonder if I could have the honor

587
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,320
of inviting you to appreciate and critique it.

588
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
I would love some feedback from you.

589
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,250
I wouldn't say I'm an expert in appreciation and critique.

590
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,650
However, since you personally invited me,

591
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,470
I'd be happy to enjoy the piece.

592
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,100
Then please join me at Cloud Pavilion.

593
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,160
Alright.

594
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,910
Let's go.

595
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,790
I wonder where that little wildcat has run off to.

596
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,090
Last night, because of Jin Shangyu,

597
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,800
she was upset with me for half the day.

598
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,990
I hadn't even said anything,

599
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,390
yet she started throwing a little tantrum.

600
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,920
It seems I really can't let her have her way like this anymore.

601
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,850
Young Lord.

602
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,220
Was my melody

603
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,470
not to your liking?

604
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,000
I was too presumptuous.

605
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,530
I should have practiced this piece more

606
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,110
before inviting you over.

607
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,170
Not at all.

608
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,190
Your musical skills are exquisite.

609
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,910
Young Lord, no need to comfort me.

610
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,990
I can tell that

611
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,350
you don't like this piece.

612
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,860
But that piece just now was indeed stunning.

613
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,500
If you don't like it,

614
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,520
what does it matter if it impresses others?

615
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,510
Young Lord.

616
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,310
I'm truly sorry.

617
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,160
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

618
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,460
I was momentarily distracted just now.

619
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,970
Did you say something?

620
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,590
Is something on your mind today?

621
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,760
I could share the burden if you would let me.

622
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,720
Now that you mention it,

623
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,920
there is indeed something I want to ask.

624
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,910
Come, sit down.

625
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,130
Here.

626
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,980
You are Ruofei's sister,

627
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,270
so naturally, you should know her best.

628
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,580
Do you know

629
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,410
what her attitude towards Jin Shangyu, her childhood friend,

630
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,550
is?

631
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,540
Although I am Ruofei's sister,

632
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,990
I don't fully understand

633
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,690
her thoughts and feelings.

634
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,740
I was a bit rash.

635
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,980
I shouldn't have asked about such a private matter.

636
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,230
I just think that

637
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,050
you're not only the person Ruofei trusts the most,

638
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,070
but also a friend I could trust.

639
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,340
That's why I ventured to ask.

640
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,230
I hope you don't mind.

641
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,930
Friend?

642
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,330
Ruoshan is fortunate that you care

643
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,810
so much about her.

644
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,390
I have heard Fei mention before

645
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
that she and Master Jin

646
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,010
have been inseparable since childhood.

647
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,510
Their relationship is quite deep.

648
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,970
I've also heard Fei say

649
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,000
that the luckiest thing for her

650
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,810
was to reunite with Master Jin

651
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,300
and rekindle their past connection.

652
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,220
That little devil must be up to no good coming here today.

653
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,030
I'd better come to my sister's place for some peace first.

654
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,230
About what we discussed today,

655
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,560
I hope you can keep it confidential for me.

656
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,090
I understand.

657
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,070
I already know your intentions.

658
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,750
To be favored by you

659
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,370
is a blessing from past lives.

660
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,720
I know what to do.

661
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,360
Intentions?

662
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,590
What intentions?

663
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,550
And favor?

664
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,020
Could it be that the person the little devil likes is actually my sister?

665
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
That's good then.

666
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,560
I'll take my leave now.

667
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,540
So he came to Symphony Workshop to supervise the assessment

668
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,920
in order to see my sister.

669
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,450
Then why did he do that to me?

670
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,150
That flirtatious ghost, big liar!

671
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,160
Who wants to eat your lousy melon?

672
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,950
What's wrong?

673
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,970
You're not even eating the sweet melon anymore?

674
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,050
What sweet melon?

675
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,690
It's just a stinky melon.

676
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,950
The person stinks too.

677
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,390
You're in a bad mood.

678
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,470
Alright, don't be upset.

679
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,220
Let me ask you something.

680
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,510
About the

681
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,720
musician audition for the ceremony,

682
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,850
are you interested?

683
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,000
Of course!

684
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,080
If I can win this audition,

685
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,360
I'll be able to perform at the Heaven Worship Ceremony.

686
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,450
Then, I can meet Madam Yaoshan.

687
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,740
So, about the theme of 'Yearning',

688
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,080
do you have any ideas?

689
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,110
Oh no!

690
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,200
Thanks to that little devil,

691
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I haven't had time to think about it.

692
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,270
Shangyu.

693
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,490
What do you think yearning feels like?

694
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,590
Yearning is when you remember and long for someone

695
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,580
even if you're thousands of miles apart.

696
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,550
It's a feeling that grows deeper

697
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,780
and more intense with time.

698
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,020
It's the most beautiful

699
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,000
and sincere emotion in this world.

700
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,240
But it's also the most painful and helpless one.

701
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,540
Why do you say it's the most beautiful

702
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,750
yet painful and helpless emotion?

703
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,670
If yearning leads to being together forever,

704
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,380
then of course it's beautiful.

705
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,440
But if yearning ultimately ends in missing each other,

706
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,990
then it becomes painful and helpless.

707
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,250
Ruofei,

708
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,850
actually, all these years,

709
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,430
I've been experiencing the pain of yearning.

710
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,940
Really?

711
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,140
I've always...

712
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,600
Always... always...

713
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,050
Always had... had...

714
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,160
Don't rush.

715
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,930
After what you just said,

716
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,350
I already have a vague understanding

717
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,950
of what Yearning feels like.

718
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,010
Take your time.

719
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,040
What are you doing here?

720
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,410
To take you back to the mansion.

721
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,320
Shangyu and I

722
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,970
have more important things to discuss.

723
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,130
I'm not going back.

724
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,230
Wait a moment.

725
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,190
We're returning to the mansion.

726
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,050
I know that

727
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,880
the Young Lord has always been charming and romantic,

728
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,280
but Ruofei is a pure and kind-hearted girl.

729
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,410
You shouldn't deceive her

730
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,610
and selfishly keep her by your side.

731
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,810
Step aside.

732
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,810
Shangyu,

733
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,860
it's getting late.

734
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,970
Why don't we discuss the details

735
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,960
of the Heaven Worship Ceremony

736
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,220
on another day?

737
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,490
I'll be going now.
