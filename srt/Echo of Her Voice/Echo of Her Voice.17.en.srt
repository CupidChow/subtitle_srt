You can't just barge into Young Lord's Mansion!

00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,580
Let go of me.

00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,680
Let go!

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,850
Wait, Mr. Jin.

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,830

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,130
Why are you here?

11
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,920
I had something to take care of.

Wasn't she drunk?

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,890
I had someone take her home.

Why don't you just tell His Majesty the truth?

As you just said,

61
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,370
all evidence is gone.

62
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,170
Even if my father were to believe me,

63
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,190
without any evidence,

64
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,680
how I could ask him

even if my father did so,

68
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,770
Yun Shang would deny it completely.

69

have to send him a gift

74

and see if he dares to accept it.

76
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,540
Any news from Yongkang Palace?

His Majesty is furious.

78
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,620
He's asked Supervisory Office to investigate it.

79
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,210
But Young Lord didn't mention you.

80
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,990
I guess they really didn't find any

81
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,250
conclusive evidence.

82
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,860

Yes.

88
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,410

Greetings, Uncle.

102
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,300
I heard your mansion was attacked by assassins yesterday.

103
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,390
I was going to see you.

104
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,590
But you came.

105
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,980
Let me take a look.

106
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,380
Are you injured?

107
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,900
Thank you for your concern.

108
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm unharmed.

109
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm just a bit shaken up.

110
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,010
That's good.

111
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,840
Who wouldn't be shocked by such an accident?

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,790
But don't worry.

113
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,820
Once Supervisory Office solves it,

114
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,540
I'll have the culprit annihilated

115
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,760
to avenge you.

116
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,210
Thank you then.

117
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,790
But what really shocked me was

118
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,360
the identity of the assassin.

119
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,210
So you know who he was?

120
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,870
It's none other than your capable general,

121
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,110
Huang Fu.

122
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
You must be joking.

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,910
Huang Fu resigned and went home

124
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,390
half a month ago.

125
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,070
He couldn't be in Symphony City.

126
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,400
Even if he were,

127
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,550
he wouldn't try to assassinate you.

129
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
Bring it in.

130
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,690
What's this supposed to mean?

131
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,840
Yesterday, General Huang led men to assassinate me and failed.

132
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,060
He burned himself to death with phosphorus fire pills in front of me.

133
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,660
It was really gruesome.

134
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,140
Today, I came to return the remains.

135
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,830
You're slandering me with

136
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,350
a charred,

137
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,750
unrecognizable corpse!

138
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
I'll repeat.

139
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,870
Huang Fu has returned home.

140
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,830
If you don't believe me,

141
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,020
let's go to Yongkang Palace right now

142
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,080
to ask my brother to investigate this.

143

If I'm involved in this,

144
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll accept the death penalty.

145
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,210
Did I mis-identify him in my shock

146
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,800
because they looked alike?

147
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,860
It seems I was a bit rash today.

148
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,500
I must still be terrified from the accident.

149
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,410
I hope you won't blame me.

150
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,030
Very well.

151

Cloud City's mayor's behavior

was very unusual.

180
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,530
Do you think our visit today

181
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,600
has provoked him?

182
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,370
Will he make his next move?

183
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm not sure.

184
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,540
Huang Fu's death has made Yun Shang mature.

185
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,450
He's learned to conceal his true intentions.

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
won't leave Yun Shang indifferent.

191
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,410
Pass the order.

192
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,750
From now on,

193
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,620
strengthen the mansion's security.

194
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,150
Yes.

195
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,190
Who is it?

196
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,730
It's me.

197
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,490
Come in.

198
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,100
Young Lord.

199
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,310
Su Ruofei, Jin Shangyu, and Huang Ying

200
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,110
have left the city this morning.

201
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,070
Send a few secret guards to escort them discreetly.

202
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,180
Ensure they arrive safely in Cloud City.

203
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,660
Yes.

204
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,270
Also,

205
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,940
find a way to send

206
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,730
daily reports about Su Ruofei by letter.

207
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,330
Yes.

208
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,870
Huang Fu.

209
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,400
You've been my mentor since I was little.

210
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,850
You've been with me on the battlefield for over a decade...

211
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,400
serving me wholeheartedly.

212
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,790
But now...

213
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,820
you've met such a tragic end.

214
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,520
I couldn't even retrieve

215
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,950
your charred remains.

216
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,610
I let them discard you in a mass grave.

217
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,920
I can't even set up a memorial tablet for you.

218
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,490
I have failed you.

219
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,470
Young Master.

220
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,780
The troops are in formation.

221
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,840
We can depart.

222
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,810
Okay.

223
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,710
Okay.

224
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,030
This is your first battle.

225
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,290
It's okay to be afraid,

226
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,670
but you mustn't show it.

227
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,870
Please rest assured.

228
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,930
With me by your side,

229
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,660
I'll ensure your return is safe

230
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,830
and meritorious.

231
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,010
Congratulations on becoming the mayor of Cloud City.

232
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,080
You helped me

233
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,960
earn this on the battlefield.

234
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,820
I'll be eternally grateful.

235
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,290
[Cloud Pavilion]

236
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,180
Please come in.

237
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,230
Have a seat.

238
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,010
No need.

239
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,890
I heard you were attacked at the mansion.

240
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:58,780
Are you hurt?

241
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,340
No.

242
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,010
I came here today

243
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,810
to retrieve the other half of the jasper.

244
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,550
Why do you want my jasper?

245
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,940
Because that jasper

246
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,690
never belonged to you.

247
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,260
You pretended to be the jasper girl

248
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,510
to get close to me.

249
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,300
What's your aim?

250
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,000
I didn't impersonate anyone.

251
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,350
Because Fei had caused trouble then,

252
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,230
I thought I'd temporarily

253
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,530
be the jasper girl

254
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,290
just to plead for Fei.

255
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,240
Then I'd find a chance to explain to you slowly.

256
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,100
But later...

257
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,080
Later, I fell in love with you.

258
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,150
So I erred again and again

259
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,830
to hide the truth.

260
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,610
If it's about the aim,

261
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,820
my aim is...

262
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,390
to have my sincere feelings for you

263
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,880
be reciprocated.

264
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,370
Young Lord, I—

265
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,370
I only have Ruofei in my heart.

266
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,860
Even if you exhaust all your schemes,

267
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,580
you can never replace her.

268
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,080
Who really set fire to the instrument room?

269
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,820
I think you know the answer very well.

270
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,840
I believe Ruofei didn't lie.

271
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,170
As for the marriage between us,

272
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,120
it was never possible from the start.

273
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,050
Take care of yourself.

274
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,220
Even after

275
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,490
banishing Fei from Symphony City,

276
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,580
I still can't win Young Lord over.

277
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,790
[Zhaoxi Villa]

278
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,490
You mean...
[Zhaoxi Villa]

279
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,540
You mean...

280
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,260
You don't want this marriage either?

281
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,380
My words carry no weight.

282
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,860
Even if I don't like it, I can only accept it.

283
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,390
That day at Symphony Workshop,

284
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,250
I was just momentarily confused.

285
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,350
Also, fearing that walls have ears,

286
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,510
I spoke coldly to you.

287
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
I hope you'll forgive me.

288
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,110
Your leg's still injured.

289
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,770
Be careful.

290
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,350
How'd I blame you?

291
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,780
Actually, I've told my brother many times

292
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,460
to annul this betrothal.

293
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,620
But he stubbornly refused.

294
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,780
I really don't get it.

295
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,170
Mu clearly likes Su Ruofei.

296
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,250
Why does he insist on you marrying Mu?

297
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,030
I...

298
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,030
Shanshan.

299
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,260
You can tell me anything.

300
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,730
I'll stand up for you.

301
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,950
I heard a rumor

302
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,440
about the music minister.

303
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,760
I wonder if you've heard of it.

304
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,800
To the commoners,

305
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,750
the union of His Majesty and Madam Yaoshan

306
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,980
is a beautiful story.

307
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,280
They hope

308
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,410
Young Lord can carry on this legacy

309
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,080
by marrying a music minister as well.

310
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,050
Currently,

311
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,210
you're most likely to become

312
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,350
the music minister.

313
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,700
That's why my brother insists on Mu marrying you.

314
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,760
Could it be that he has already decided

315
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,980
to pass on the monarch position to Mu?

316
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,870
Shanshan.

317
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,140
Be honest with me.

318
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,440
Do you really not like Mu?

319
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,680
Okay.

320
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll clarify things with my brother.

321
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,060
I'll do whatever it takes

322
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
to make him annul this betrothal.

323
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,630
But His Majesty's word is the law.

324
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,720
What he has said cannot be taken back.

325
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,080
Unless...

326
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,350
Unless what?

327
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,800
Unless something bad happens to me.

328
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,860
Then I won't have to marry Young Lord.

329
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,400
No way.

330
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,300
How could I let anything bad happen to you?

331
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,570
Then there's no other way.

332
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,700
Anyway, you must be safe.

333
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,380
Something bad has to happen to him then.

334
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,030
Have you heard about

335
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,590
an assassination attack at Mu's mansion yesterday?

336
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,250
Who could be so bold

337
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,130
to assassinate Young Lord?

338
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,390
No way... Was it you, Mayor?

339
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,510
I wasn't going to let him marry you anyway.

340
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,990
Now that I know

341
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,120
you don't like this betrothal either,

342
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,020
I can't let him live anymore.

343
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,650
I've always been grateful

344
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,430
for your love to me.

345
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,910
But Young Lord is His Majesty's only son.

346
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,320
If you go against him,

347
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,850
your status alone puts you at a disadvantage.

348
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,430
Mayor.

349
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,530
Please listen to my advice.

350
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,750
Please stop here.

351
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,310
So what if he's His Majesty's only son?

352
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,110
Half of Dongsheng's territory

353
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,350
was conquered by me.

354
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,590
With just a wave of my arm,

355
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,410
many would lay down their lives for me.

356
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,210
But Yun Mu?

357
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,870
If he raises his voice,

358
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,830
people would just stare at him.

359
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,990
Mayor, please...

360
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,670
-don't risk it for me.
-Shanshan.

361
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,600
What's this for?

362
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,390
Now that Fei has returned to Cloud City,

363
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,650
in Symphony City,

364
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,950
you're the only one I can rely on.

365
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,790
I only wish for your happiness

366
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,750
and health.

367
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,490
As long as you're safe and sound,

368
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,960
even if I'm indignant,

369
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,110
I'll accept the marriage appointed by

370
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,390
His Majesty.

371
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,980
Shanshan.

372
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,470
The only fate

373
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,160
you've to accept

374
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,390
is to be my wife

375
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,880
and the future monarch's wife.

376
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,830
I'll give you the very best.

377
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,590
You won't suffer even the slightest bit.

378
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,150
Since you're so sincere to me,

379
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,900
from now on,

380
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,170
I'll share honor and disgrace with you.

381
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,300
But your failure this time

382
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,520
must've made Young Lord more vigilant.

383
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,790
It won't be easy to

384
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,790
attack him again

385
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,670
in Symphony City.

386
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,920
If we could somehow lure him to Cloud City,

387
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,720
it might be easier to kill him.

388
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,880
Cloud City is under my jurisdiction.

389
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,150
It would be easier to act there.

390
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,030
But given the current situation,

391
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,640
it's not that easy to get Yun Mu to set foot

392
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,350
in Cloud City again.

393
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,130
If you trust me,

394
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,300
let me offer you a plan.

395
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,270
Xiaoqi.

396
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,070
Xiaoqi!

397
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,650
What’s wrong?

398
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,750
Is there any news from Cloud City?

399
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,640
Not yet.

400
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,520
The earliest we should expect is tomorrow.

401
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,840
But I'll be alert at all times.

402
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,490
Young Lord.

403
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,440
It's been three days since Su Ruofei left,

404
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,290
and you haven't slept for three days.

405
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,980
How can your body take this?

406
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,620
Please listen to my advice

407
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,990
and get some rest.

408
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,440
Young Lord.

409
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,400
If you really wear yourself out,

410
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,130
Su Ruofei will be worried too.

411
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,110
You didn't see

412
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,260
the last time she came here looking for you.

413
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,120
She was so anxious and concerned.

414
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,400
I think she was just momentarily angry.

415
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,970
She still cares about you.

416
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,770
Is what you've said true?

417
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,000
It's true.

418
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,950
So please, get some rest.

419
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
You wouldn't

420
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,570
want to look so haggard

421
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,110
the next time you see her.

422
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,800
Next time...

423
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,830
Will we meet again?

424
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,420
Of course.

425
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,190
Okay.

426
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,230
I'll rest for a while.

427
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,870
Right.

428
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,110
If there's any letter from Cloud City...

429
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,840
I'll bring it to you right away.

430
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,950
You may go.

431
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,790
We will meet again.

432
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,870
We will, right?

433
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,630
Huang Fu.

434
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,170
You were right.

435
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,060
I was indeed blinded by romantic feelings.

436
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,700
But if you really think

437
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,900
I don't know Shanshan is using me,

438
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,960
then you've underestimated me.

439
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,750
Of course I know

440
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,460
Shanshan doesn't like me.

441
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,720
But what can I do? I like her.

442
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,990
Don't worry though.

443
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,540
I won't act rashly anymore.

444
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,030
For you,

445
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,030
for Shanshan,

446
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,730
for the buddies who've always followed us,

447
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,650
I must take the position of royal advisor

448
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,790
from Yun Mu's hands.

449
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,440
Then I'll give you a grand funeral.

450
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,630
Jin.

451
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,330
Yes, Mayor.

452
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,790
Deliver this letter to Shuangxi,

453
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,360
a maid at Su's Mansion in Cloud City.

454
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,790
Yes.

455
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,310
Wait.

456
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,600
Stay there and wait for my order.

457
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,470
Okay.

458
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,700
[Su's Mansion]

459
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,070
Dad! Mom!

460
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,460
I'm back!

461
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,150
Fei?

462
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,710
Fei!

463
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,870
-Fei!
-Mom.

464
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,270
Fei.

465
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,000
It really is my Fei.

466
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,880
You silly child.

467
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,780
Why didn't you tell us you're coming back?

468
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,180
You've lost more weight.

469
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,600
I didn't.

470
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,390
I told your dad

471
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,190
that since you're away from home alone,

472
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,890
you can't take good care of yourself.

473
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,420
But he wouldn't believe me.

474
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,680
Where's Shan?

475
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,760
Why didn't she come back with you?

476
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,570
She...

477
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,540
She's very busy in Symphony City.

478
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,570
That's true.

479
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,330
Shan wrote earlier saying

480
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
she's now the lead musician.

481
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,440
That must be

482
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,750
a tough job.

483
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,730
And Shan's so ambitious.

484
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,630
My dear.

485
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,190
Our girl just arrived with friends,

486
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,590
and you're already nagging.

487
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,740
They might be starving.

488
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,610
I'm just too happy.

489
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,750
I forgot.

490
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,660
Shuangxi, make some tea

491
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,750
and tell the kitchen to prepare a meal.

492
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,390
Hurry up.

493
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,350
Yes, Madam, Sir.

494
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:56,710
Come in.

495
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,100
Thank you, Uncle, Auntie.

496
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,090
What for?

497
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,170
Just treat this as your home.

498
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,830
Fei.

499
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,660
They are...

500
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,860
She's Huang Ying.

501
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,490
He's...

502
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,380
Uncle, Auntie,

503
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,900
I'm Jin Shangyu.

504
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,890
Jin Shangyu?

505
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,700
Is that the...

506
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,270
Jin Shangyu?

507
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,760
Dongsheng's Master Jin Shangyu?

508
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,700
Oh my gosh.

509
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,590
I even bought

510
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,030
a music score with your autograph.

511
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,710
It really is Jin Shangyu!

512
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,390
I never thought you and Fei

513
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,220
were friends.

514
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,550
This must be a blessing from our ancestors!

515
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,770
You're too kind, Auntie.

516
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,610
Mom.

517
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,210
Do you really not recognize him?

518
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,320
He used to hang around our house,

519
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,510
waiting for meals. That chubby boy.

520
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,750
You mean...

521
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,770
Little Shangyu.

522
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,330
Yu?

523
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,410
Now that you mention it,

524
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,540
his features do look a bit familiar.

525
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,360
My dear child,

526
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,390
you're so thin I can't recognize you!

527
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,210
Eat more later, okay?

528
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,450
When you were little,

529
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,120
you could eat two racks of buns in one go.

530
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,560
You still remember that?

531
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,600
Of course.

532
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,430
Come on, come on.

533
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:02,790
Okay.

534
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,850
-Come in.
-Come on.

535
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,130
-Please.
-Come in.

536
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,450
Help your friends in.

537
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,290
It's so nice to have a mom.

538
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,060
What are you saying?

539
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,000
This is now your home.

540
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,590
Let's go.

541
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,670
[Green Flash Workshop]

542
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,800
What do you think?
[Green Flash Workshop]

543
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,030
[Green Flash Workshop]

544
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,380
Whose workshop is this?
[Green Flash Workshop]

545
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,830
Whose workshop is this?

546
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,830
Mine.

547
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,040
Which room will I stay in?

548
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,290
You'll stay there then.

549
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,430
Whose room is this?

550
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,630
This is mine.

551
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:33,780
Nice.

552
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,810
This workshop's quite well-built.

553
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,870
Much better than Symphony Workshop.

554
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,450
If you like it here,

555
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,640
you can join us too.

556
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,350
Shangyu.

557
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,000
You can also join the workshop.

558
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,410
If you don't mind

559
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,620
tarnishing your master status...

560
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,020
Hold on.

561
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,830
When you first established this workshop,

562
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,430
I was the first one to sign up.

563
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,980
Then count me in.

564
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,240
I want to be with Jin.

565
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,160
It's a deal.

566
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,480
If you join,

567
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,430
the others will love it.

568
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,300
Fei?

569
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,240
Monkey! Biao!

570
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,640
Come now! See who's back!

571
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,550
-Fei!
-Monkey!

572
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,950
Fei!

573
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,050
-Eleven! Monkey!
-Fei!

574
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,470
Fei!

575
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,800
-Biao!
-Fei!

576
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,800
Isn't this Master Jin?

577
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,020
-Master Jin!
-Why are you here?

578
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,790
-Master Jin.
-Master Jin.

579
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,040
Pleased to meet you.

580
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,760
From now on,

581
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,740
Master Jin will be one of us.

582
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,700
-Really?
-Really?

583
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,630
I must've

584
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,050
saved a life in my past life

585
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,310
to get to work with you.

586
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,940
I've made it.

587
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,930
I've made it!

588
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,730
You're too kind.

589
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,170
How've you all been?

590
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,480
We...

591
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
We perform at the dance hall at night

592
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,830
and wait for you here in the day.

593
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,250
We knew you'd keep your word

594
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,050
and come back.

595
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,470
Yes.

596
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:46,830
Yes.

597
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:47,710
Fei.

598
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,750
How did things go in Symphony City?

599
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,750
Did you win?

600
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,900
So now you must be...

601
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,710
The music minister.

602
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,370
Yes, yes, the music minister.

603
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,140
Well... It's a long story.

604
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,470
But I'm back for good

605
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,400
this time.

606
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,810
We can talk about it slowly.

607
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,550
Really?

608
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,550
-Okay.
-Great!

609
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,620
Fei.

610
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,020
Who is she?

611
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,170
I'm Huang Ying.

612
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm Jin's fiancée,

613
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,780
and I'll be joining you as a new member.

614
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,160
Sister-in-law!

615
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,460
Welcome!

616
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,410
I never thought our Green Flash Workshop

617
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,140
would have such a glorious day.

618
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,030
I've also discussed with them.

619
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,460
After we reopen the workshop,

620
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,700
we'll bring in more people to expand it.

621
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,280
As you say, Fei!

622
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,030
Fei.

623
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,500
We'll go buy some wine and food.

624
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,660
-Let’s celebrate.
-Yeah, yeah.

625
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,470
We'll go get wine.

626
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:43,870
Okay.

627
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,180
Yeah.

628
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,440
-We're off.
-Let’s go.

629
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,450
Let's go in.

630
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,880
Come on.

631
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,170
It's been a safe journey, having drinking contests with Huang Ying

632
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,540
and playing music with Mr. Jin for fun.

633
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,410
It's only been a few days since she left me,

634
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:02,520
and she's forgotten about her promises.

635
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,490
[Having drinking contests with Huang Ying and playing music with Mr. Jin for fun]
and she's forgotten about her promises.

636
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,020
[Having drinking contests with Huang Ying and playing music with Mr. Jin for fun]

637
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,640
Right, Xiaoqi.

638
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,870
Ruofei should've

639
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,720
arrived in Cloud City by now.

640
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,590
Why are the letters from the past few days

641
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,990
still about her journey?

642
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,610
Young Lord.

643
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,010
Letters take time

644
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,540
to be delivered.

645
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,510
Tell the secret guards to speed up.

646
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,240
Young Lord.

647
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,880
They're already doing the best they can.

648
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,170
It can't be any faster.

649
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,100
I see.

650
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,770
You may go.

651
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,070
I wonder what that little wildcat

652
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,310
is up to now.
