I'm Su Ruoshan from Symphony Workshop.

00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,020
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Ladyship.

7
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm Su Ruofei from Green Flash Workshop.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,540
Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Ladyship.

9
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,280
Su Ruofei.

10
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,330
Yes.

11
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,720
Your performance was truly stunning.

12
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,510
You were able to convey

13
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,630
the compassion in this song.

14
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,120
You must have great love in your heart.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,720
No wonder Mu is so fond of you.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,180
Thank you for your kind words, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,880
My Lady,

18
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,150
what do you think?

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,180

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,420
were equally impressive.

22
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,800
It's truly hard to choose between the two of you as the music minister.

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,300
His Majesty would like the two of you to take a short break.

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,760
The music minister will be announced later.

25
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,430
Thank you, Your Majesty and Your Ladyship.

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,070
My Lord.

27
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,590
Yes.

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:43,930
Come on.

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,270
Bottoms up.

30
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,950
Eleven, Monkey.

31
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,590
How was it?

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,650
No regrets, right?

33
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,020
No regrets.

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,350
Then I'll go find Shangyu and the others first.

35
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,030
Okay.

36
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,830
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,590
I didn't mean to spill it on you.

38
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,810
-It's okay.
-Did you get burned?

39
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,110
I didn't mean to do that.

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,990
It's alright, it's alright.

42
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,730
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,320
How can this be alright?

44
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,500
You're about to be appointed as music minister.

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,790
Your clothes are so dirty now.

46
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,790
What if you become a laughing stock?

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,590
That's right, Fei.

48
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,750
You should go get changed.

49
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,120
It's unsightly.

50
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,090
Then, let me take you to change your clothes.

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,800
I'll go get changed then.

52
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,680
This broth tastes really good.

53
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,510
Jin.

54
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,770
Do you want to try some?

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,830
I'll pass.

56
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,090
Master Jin.

57
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,030
It's our honor to have performed on the same stage as you.

58
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,960
You're too kind.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,140
Guys.

60
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,100
Where's Ruofei?

61
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,260
She went to get changed.

62
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,320
Get changed?

63
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,000
Why does she want to get changed?

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,180
Just now, a maid

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,940
accidentally spilled some soup on her.

66
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,910
But she should have been back by now.

67
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,710
I was also wondering about that.

68
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,910
Could it be that someone wants to set her up?

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,340
Don't say that!

70
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,250
Mu.

71
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,790
Uncle.

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,910
So you're here.

73
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,440
Today is your mother's birthday.

74
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,640
We should drink to our heart's content.

75
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,610
Uncle, you're absolutely right.

76
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,700
Come on, everyone.

77
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll toast you guys first.

78
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,430
Go find Xiaoqi.

79
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,380
Come on.

80
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,830
Uncle.

81
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,440
Let's go.

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,940
Please.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,220
Let's go.

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,440
Xiaoqi.

85
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,180
How is it?

86
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,630
I've asked around.

87
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,270
No one knows

88
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,870
where Ms. Su was taken.

89
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,410
I...

90
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,650
All right.

91
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,660
You two head back first.

92
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,680
In case Ruofei returns,

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,990
you can be there to take care of her.

94
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,730
Okay.

95
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,320
Xiaoqi, Huang Ying.

96
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,450
Let's split up

97
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,390
and search separately.

98
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,120
-Yes.
-Okay.

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,460
Come on, bottoms up.

100
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,320
Uncle.

101
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,480
It's a bit noisy here.

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,210
I want to go out and get some air.

103
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,650
Excuse me for a moment.

104
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,080
Mu.

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,960
It won't hurt to stay a bit longer.

106
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,020
Oh, right.

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,720
There's something I've been meaning to ask you.

108
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,590
I wonder if you've heard about

109
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,150
the recent rumors about you in the city, Mu.

110
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,740
Uncle, you said they're just rumors yourself.

111
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,450
Why would I take them to heart?

112
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,140
You may not take them to heart,

113
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,780
but I can't ignore them.

114
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,510
It's a serious matter.

115
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,140
I must stand up for you.

116
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,230
What are you two talking about?

117
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,690
Father.

118
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,620
Your Majesty.

119
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,150
I was talking to Mu about the recent

120
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,910
rumors about him in the city.

121
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,290
They've been saying

122
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,630
Mu is deaf.

123
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,920
Of course, I don't believe it.

124
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,300
But since Mu is the Young Lord of Dongsheng,

125
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,390
it seems inappropriate if we just allow such rumors to spread among the people,

126
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,510
doesn't it?

127
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,810
Yes, you're right.

128
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,110
I've already sent people to investigate this matter.

129
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,560
Anyone spreading or creating rumors

130
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,630
will be punished according to the law.

131
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,740
Those who discuss the Young Lord in private

132
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,950
will face even harsher penalties.

133
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,030
Brother.

134
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,230
Dealing with such matters requires guidance, not suppression.

135
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,510
The more you forbid them from talking,

136
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,510
the more they'll believe it's true.

137
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,790
To completely resolve these rumors,

138
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,590
we just need to find a way to prove Mu's innocence.

139
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,470
Wouldn't that suffice?

140
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,390
Don't you agree?

141
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,400
Indeed.

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
That's right.

143
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,830
I've heard about this too.

144
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,000
I actually agree with what the Mayor of Cloud City said.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,940
It's better to prove Young Lord's innocence.

146
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,660
Since everyone is here today,

147
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,930
we can all bear witness for Young Lord.

148
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,550
Bear witness.

149
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,550
That makes sense.

150
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,640
I didn't expect such a tiny rumor

151
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,210
to concern everyone so much.

152
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,210
Mu,

153
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,950
go ahead and prove it to them.

154
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,640
Yes, Father.

155
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,370
I wonder, Uncle and esteemed mayors,

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,660
how you'd like me to prove myself.

157
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,330
How about this?

158
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,130
They say all the melodies in the world

159
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,730
are stored in your heart, Mu.

160
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,670
How about we let the musicians from Symphony Workshop

161
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,180
play a piece of music?

162
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,350
If you can recognize

163
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,550
which piece it is, Mu,

164
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,110
then the rumors will naturally be scotched.

165
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,510
It can also prove

166
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,990
that our Mu is indeed

167
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,590
the greatest music connoisseur in Dongsheng.

168
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,930
Wouldn't this be the best of both worlds?

169
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,890
That makes sense.

170
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,710
Alright.

171
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,080
They dared to kidnap me at the birthday banquet.

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,880
They must be after Little Devil.

173
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,620
I need to find a way out.

174
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,470
[Prosperity]

175
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,130
Yun Shang.

176
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,410
What's that supposed to mean?

177
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,840
Your Majesty.

178
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,870
To prevent anyone from suspecting Mu of cheating

179
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,030
and guessing the song title by observing the fingering,

180
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,650
I've specially brought a folding screen

181
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,130
to separate the musicians.

182
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,880
This way, Mu won't be able to see anything.

183
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,140
This should prove his innocence, right?

184
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,450
What do you think, Mu?

185
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,380
Let's get started then.

186
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,980
It's the "Green Flash Song".

187
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,380
Mu surely won't fail to recognize it.

188
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,680
[Prosperity]

189
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
Mu isn't responding.

190
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,710
Could it be he can't recognize the "Green Flash Song"?

191
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,250
[Prosperity]

192
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,240
Let's wait a bit longer.

193
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,350
Mu is naturally mischievous.

194
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,580
He might be teasing us.

195
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,590
It can't be as the rumors say, that he...

196
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,080
It can't be.

197
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,770
Should I order them to stop this music test?

198
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,470
No.

199
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,490
If we ask them to stop now,

200
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,690
wouldn't it confirm that Mu is deaf?

201
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,690
A bit longer. Let's wait a bit longer.

202
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,990
Have you found her?

203
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,990
We can't just keep searching like this. It's leading nowhere.

204
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,750
Such a grown person

205
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,380
couldn't have just vanished into thin air.

206
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,860
Why don't we ask around?

207
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:06,950
Okay.

208
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,670
Master Jin.

209
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,270
Excuse me.

210
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,630
I'd like to ask,

211
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,750
have you seen a girl about this tall,

212
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,230
with golden bells tied to her hands and feet?

213
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,030
Golden bells?

214
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,870
Earlier,

215
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,520
I saw someone taking that girl

216
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,880
in that direction.

217
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,610
Are you sure?

218
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,470
Yes, I am.

219
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,990
Because that's a dead end road.

220
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,940
-A dead end road?
-So I felt it was quite weird

221
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,100
at that time.

222
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,070
Thanks a lot.

223
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,830
Perhaps Mu wants to listen to the entire piece.

224
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,230
Mu.

225
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,790
Do you recognize it?

226
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,320
Even I have figured out what song it is.

227
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,830
You can't possibly fail

228
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,930
to recognize this song, right?

229
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,990
Do you want me to change a song for you?

230
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,230
[Prosperity]

231
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
As for the piece just now,

232
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,540
I listened to it in full out of respect.

233
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,580
However, it's a pity

234
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,550
that the musician's arrangements of it

235
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,470
were truly pitiful

236
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,140
and disappointing.

237
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,900
This piece was a song composed by my mother,

238
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,560
the "Green Flash Song".

239
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,220
[Prosperity]

240
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,880
However, the musician's skill

241
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,230
is not even a fraction of my mother's.

242
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,500
I have no desire to appreciate it any further.

243
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,230
Please don't be upset, Mother.

244
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,330
My lack of skill is to blame.

245
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,960
Please rise, Ms. Su.

246
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,080
It's all because Mu's ears are too picky.

247
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,130
[Prosperity]

248
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,950
"Green Flash Song", slightly modified.

249
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:31,540
[Prosperity]

250
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,480
Since Mu has recognized the song performed,

251
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,350
the rumors about his deafness

252
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,650
have been scotched.

253
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,580
If I hear any more discussion

254
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,180
on this matter in the future,

255
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,820
I won't let it go easily.

256
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,670
You're wise, Your Majesty.

257
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,650
Today is Madam's birthday,

258
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,010
a joyous occasion for all.

259
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,640
I have an important announcement to make.

260
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,870
Mu.

261
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,930
You are carefree by nature

262
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,300
and have no interest in political affairs.

263
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,240
But you are my son after all,

264
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,470
and ultimately, you must be the one to protect this land.

265
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,040
From today on,

266
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
you will be the royal advisor of Dongsheng,

267
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,620
assisting me in handling state affairs.

268
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

269
00:14:52,140 --> 00:15:02,510
[Prosperity]

270
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,830
Greetings, Royal Advisor.

271
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,610
[Prosperity]

272
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,830
[Prosperity]

273
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,790
Yun Shang.

274
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,810
Yun Shang!

275
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,340
You are my younger brother.

277
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,780
From now on, you must assist the royal advisor well.

278
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,440
Do you understand?

279
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,120
I do.

280
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,760
I will certainly assist...

281
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,240
Assist the royal advisor well.

282
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,430
Musician Su from Green Flash Workshop.

283
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,650
I am here, Your Ladyship.

284
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,320
You used your feet instead of hands

285
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,980
to perform the drum dance.

286
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,290
It shows your mastery in music.

287
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,690
I hereby declare you the best musician in the world,

288
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,520
and name you the music minister.

289
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,590
The investiture ceremony will be held on a chosen day.

290
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,730
She's the music minister!

291
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,480
She's the music minister!

292
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,250
Wake up.

293
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,070
Thank you, Madam Yaoshan.

294
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

295
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,730
Ms. Su, lead musician of Symphony Workshop.

296
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,030
You have exceptional musical skills

297
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,360
and exemplary conduct.

298
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,910
I hereby appoint you as vice music director,

299
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,750
and you'll keep working at Symphony Workshop

300
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,670
to assist Minister Ling in teaching duties.

301
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,410
Additionally,

302
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,220
I hereby award you a thousand taels of gold,

303
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,940
two sets of jade headdresses,

304
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,720
and one Yunhua Brocade Dress

305
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,770
as encouragement.

306
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,340
I, Su Ruoshan, thank you for the rewards, Your Majesty.

307
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm Su Ruofei, boss of Green Flash Workshop.

308
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,150
Greetings, Your Majesty.

309
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,680
Greetings, Madam Yaoshan.

310
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,600
Mu said you wish to speak.

311
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,350
Feel free to tell us what's on your mind.

312
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,400
Your Majesty, Your Ladyship.

313
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,640
Now that I've become the music minister,

314
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,900
all the official workshops in Dongsheng

315
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,700
should follow my orders, right?

316
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,450
Of course.

317
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,950
Then may I change the old rules?

318
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,230
What rules do you want to change?

319
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,630
I want to

320
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,150
change the official workshops' admission rules.

321
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,030
Your Majesty, Your Ladyship.

322
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,590
You just heard

323
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,550
Green Flash Workshop's performance.

324
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,310
Did you like it?

325
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,840
Did you find it delightful?

326
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,650
However, I'm the only one in our workshop

327
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,230
who's qualified to join the official workshop.

328
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,480
Do you know why?

329
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,510
Monkey Zhao was accused of indecent appearance

330
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,340
for being too fat;

331
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,180
Eleven was called disabled

332
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,550
for having six fingers on one hand.

333
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,580
There's also... Biao.

334
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,160
Due to his background,

335
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,060
he was accused of humble origins.

336
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,480
They're all talented.

337
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,720
But because of these reasons,

338
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,780
they weren't qualified to join the official workshop.

339
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,000
However, they didn't give up.

340
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,800
They didn't give up their passion for music,

341
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,170
nor did they give up their dreams.

342
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,910
They joined

343
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,020
a private workshop, the Green Flash Workshop,

344
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,880
and continued to bring joy to people through music.

345
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,350
But all along,

346
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,330
the official workshops have had the final say.

347
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,150
Only what's performed by the official workshops

348
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,610
is considered real music.

349
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,460
As for private workshops like ours,

350
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,250
no matter how popular we are with people,

351
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,280
we're still considered inferior.

352
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,590
But I believe there's no hierarchy in music,

353
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,620
and they just have different functions.

354
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,480
The music of the official workshop

355
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,290
represents the dignity of Dongsheng

356
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,550
and deserves respect,

357
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,410
while the music of private workshops is loved by the common people

358
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,010
and deserves equal respect.

359
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,100
Father, Mother.

360
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
I also agree with what Ruofei said.

361
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,610
Now that the world is at peace,

362
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,950
the happiness of the common people

363
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,550
is the most important thing.

364
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,470
I think

365
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,030
you might as well take opportunity of this music minister investiture ceremony

366
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,460
to open up the Symphony Workshop, Father,

367
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,040
and allow musicians from the official workshop and private workshops to perform together.

368
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,790
This way, all the people of Dongsheng

369
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,190
can celebrate the prosperity of Dongsheng together with us.

370
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,360
Okay.

371
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,160
Please rise.

372
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,770
Thank you, Madam Yaoshan.

374
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,960
You will be the host of this investiture ceremony.

375
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,630
Madam and I will attend together

376
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,250
and enjoy it with the people.

377
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,430
There's also another important matter

378
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,110
to be announced at the investiture ceremony.

379
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,520
What else is there?

380
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,340
You'll know when the time comes, My Lady.

381
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,340
It's an important matter.

382
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,040
Why haven't they come out yet?

383
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,730
I hope nothing's gone wrong again.

384
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,470
No, it won't.

385
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,350
It won't.

386
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,780
It won't.

387
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,030
As soon as the birthday banquet ended,

388
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,650
Yun Shang left with his tail between his legs.

389
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,130
Now the royal advisor has been decided,

390
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,060
and Ruofei has been appointed as the music minister,

391
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,790
if he tries to make any more trouble,

392
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,230
I'm afraid...

393
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,870
They're... They're out!

394
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,510
Ruofei, are you alright?

395
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,040
I'm fine.

396
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,430
F-F-Fei.

397
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,690
How did things go, Fei?

398
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,740
Ruofei.

399
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,260
Did His Majesty grant your request?

400
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,570
Of course.

401
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,790
Private workshops have finally been recognized.

402
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,640
Fei.

403
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,760
You won the title of music minister fair and square.

404
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,310
Fair.

405
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,490
And square.

406
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,460
It was all thanks to you guys.

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,990
If you hadn't helped me get back in time,

408
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,850
Yun Mu would have been exposed.

409
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,360
If you want to thank someone, you should thank that cook.

410
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,970
Cook?

411
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,630
It seems the place Ruofei was finally taken to

412
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,470
is here.

413
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,480
Leave the rest to me.

414
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,900
You can smell her scent?

415
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,950
I couldn't originally,

416
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,880
but coincidentally, when that maid was delivering the soup,

417
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,370
she spilled some on her clothes.

418
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,030
My nose is most sensitive to broth.

419
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,610
Then take a quick sniff.

420
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,830
It's over there.

421
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,790
Ruofei.

422
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,890
Ruofei!

423
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,420
Ruofei!

424
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,780
Are you okay?

425
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm okay.

426
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,980
Where's Little Devil?

427
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,180
Still at the banquet.

428
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,490
This is bad.

429
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,480
Let's go.

430
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,680
I still need to thank all of you.

431
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,440
Thank you for saving Ruofei.

432
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,910
I especially need to thank you.

433
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,700
Oh, right.

434
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,940
Do you remember how you were taken away?

435
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,030
I just remember following a maid.

436
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,410
Then I was knocked unconscious.

437
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,670
No need to think about it.

438
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,330
It must be Yun Shang who did it.

439
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,940
It was to expose your deafness in public.

440
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,400
Too bad we ruined his plan.

441
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,500
Now, I've been appointed as royal advisor,

442
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,160
if Yun Shang does something out of desperation,

443
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,970
I'm afraid it may still implicate you guys.

444
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,560
I'm warning you.

445
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,200
We agreed that

446
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,560
no matter what happens,

447
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,040
we'll be together.

448
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,010
I'll listen to you.

449
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,120
Your Highness.

450
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
How is it?

451
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,630
After Yun Shang left,

452
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,740
he went straight back to his villa.

453
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,800
There were no other unusual movements.

454
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,380
I've left secret guards there to continue monitoring him.

455
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,140
Since the Jiuru Banquet is over,

456
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,750
the mayors will be leaving in the next couple of days.

457
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,210
Yun Shang is no exception.

458
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,220
Before that,

459
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,220
you guys, please stay at the Young Lord's Mansion temporarily.

460
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,420
I will personally be responsible for everyone's safety.

461
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,300
They're trying to shut you up.

462
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,200
Now Yun Mu has become the royal advisor,

463
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,340
and Su Ruofei has become the music minister,

464
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,790
His Majesty and Madam

465
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,600
are using these insignificant rewards

466
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,520
to tell you

467
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,530
that the previous arranged marriage is cancelled.

468
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,840
In the end, what you've been pursuing your whole life

469
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,370
is nothing but mediocrity.

470
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,290
It's like you prepared a wedding dress for Su Ruofei.

471
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,010
You've lost.

472
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,920
No!

473
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,610
I haven't lost.

474
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,790
As long as Yun Shang is still here,

475
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,740
I haven't lost.

[Zhaoxi Villa]

477
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,550
I lost.

478
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,550
I lost to that brat Yun Mu.

479
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,920
Huang Fu.

480
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,980
I've let you down.

481
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,860
You died to protect me, yet I failed.

482
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
I failed your loyalty.

483
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,640
I should have listened to you

484
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,890
and killed Yun Mu long ago.

485
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,020
It's not too late to kill him now.

486
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,160
Shanshan.

487
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,860
Why are you here?

488
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,750
I came to confirm something with you, My Lord.

489
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,890
What is it?

490
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,050
I want to know

491
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,470
if you've really admitted defeat, My Lord.

492
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,920
What's the point of not admitting defeat?

493
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,380
Yun Mu has already been officially appointed as royal advisor.

494
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,140
This time, Brother won't change his mind again.

495
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,020
But with such a result,

496
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,850
are you content?

497
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,310
Of course I'm not content.

498
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,470
If you're not content, why not fight again?

499
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,920
My Lord, you've fought on battlefields for many years.

500
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,530
Surely you've suffered defeats before.

501
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,530
But you managed to become the mayor of a city.

502
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,530
Wasn't it because

503
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,440
no matter what kind of failures you experienced,

504
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,400
you'd always find a way to win it back?

505
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,020
So why do you admit defeat this time?

506
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,920
You're right.

507
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,730
A temporary defeat means nothing.

508
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,610
As long as I win in the end, that's what matters.

509
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,580
I can return to Cloud City to gather troops

510
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,100
and fight our way back to Symphony City.

511
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,300
No, you can't do that.

512
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,740
Firstly, Cloud City is very far away.

513
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,140
Once you go back,

514
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,140
Yun Mu will certainly be on guard.

515
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,390
If he arranges troops to block your way,

516
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,050
you might not even make it back to Symphony City.

517
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,870
Then what do you suggest?

518
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,400
Yun Mu has just been appointed as royal advisor.

519
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,870
His foundation is not yet stable.

520
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,930
If you want to rebel,

521
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,950
there will certainly be people who're willing to help you.

522
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,050
Moreover, he still has to prepare for the music minister's investiture ceremony.

523
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,450
His defenses will surely be at its weakest.

524
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,300
If you want to fight,

525
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,140
now is the best time.

526
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,660
Okay.

527
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,950
I'll go find Brother

528
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,300
and ask him to allow me to stay for the investiture ceremony before returning to Cloud City.

529
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,030
Let this investiture ceremony

530
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,780
become the final battlefield between Yun Mu and me.

Don't worry, My Lord.

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,900
No matter what happens,

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,680

However, the Symphony Workshop is now heavily guarded.

552

From now on, no fist-and-palm salute in the Symphony Workshop.

559
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,540
Salute like this.

560
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,570
Keep that in mind.

561
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,730
Yes.

562
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,020
Hold on.

563
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,070
[Instrument Room]

564
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,250
What are these two boxes?

565
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,770
One box of weapons and one box of explosives.

566
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,540
Open them.

567
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,060
How do you plan to plant these explosives?

568
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,910
The Symphony Workshop is renovating the viewing platform.

569
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,380
Our people have already blended in with the craftsmen.

570
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,330
They will find a way

571
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,220
to plant the explosives under the viewing platform.

572
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,380
Once the situation is unfavorable,

573
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,780
we'll blow up the entire viewing platform.

574
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,010
You go in first.

575
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,780
Yes.

576
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,830
Let's go.

577
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,450
Greetings, Minister.

578
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Vice Director Su.

579
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,840
Why do those musicians just now

580
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,560
look unfamiliar?

581
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,490
His Majesty ordered that during the investiture ceremony,

582
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,840
the official and private musicians will perform together.

583
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,970
Those are musicians selected by the private workshops.

584
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,730
They've just brought in some instruments.

585
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Isn't this exactly what you wanted?

586
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,770
If you have concerns, Minister,

587
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,500
feel free to check it yourself.

588
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,620
I'll also call each one of those musicians back for you.

589
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,420
No need.

590
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,160
I'm just here to give you a word of advice.

591
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,670
About what happened between us,

592
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,200
I haven't told our parents.

593
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,750
Because I'm worried they wouldn't be able to accept that

594
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,170
the eldest daughter they used to be so proud of

595
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,960
has now become a despicable person who would stop at nothing to achieve her goals,

596
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,720
regardless of family ties.

597
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
I hope you can remember

598
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,150
how our parents cared for you before

599
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,540
and not ruin the beautiful image they have of you.

600
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,960
How sanctimonious.

601
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,870
Things have come to this point,

602
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,140
and you still want to preserve this beautiful image?

603
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,380
This is nothing but your attempt to maintain

604
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,640
your hypocritical self-satisfaction.

605
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,560
Forget it.

606
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,540
Suit yourself.

607
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,600
Suit myself?

608
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,930
Do you really plan

609
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,430
to try every dish here?

610
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,580
The delicacies of Symphony Workshop

611
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,610
are renowned throughout Dongsheng.

612
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,870
I used to be afraid of gaining weight,

613
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,330
so I never even took a bite.

614
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,740
Now that I'm finally back,

615
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,060
I must indulge myself

616
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,670
and make up for all that I've deprived my stomach of

617
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,590
in the past.

618
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,700
So what are your plans next?

619
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Are you going to stay at Green Flash Workshop forever?

620
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,450
I'll wait until the music minister investiture ceremony is over.

621
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,790
Then I'll continue my travels.

622
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,140
Well, don't you think

623
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,830
you should consider what's going on between us?

624
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,400
Although I've forgiven you,

625
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,360
it doesn't mean you can keep avoiding it.

626
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,550
You should give me an answer, don't you think?

627
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,290
I'll think it over carefully.

628
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,330
No.

629
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,650
Don't try to dodge the question.

630
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,140
How long do you need to think?

631
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,340
I'm not very patient.

632
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,900
I...

633
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,200
What are you looking at?

634
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,590
Look at me!

635
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,920
Something's wrong.

636
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,710
What's wrong with them?

637
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,170
They don't even look at me.

638
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,480
I just love how arrogant you are.

639
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,810
[Young Lord's Mansion]

640
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,550
During that time when you were back in Cloud City,

641
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,550
whenever I couldn't sleep at night,

642
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,150
I would come here alone.

643
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,120
The fragrance of flowers

644
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,570
and the moonlight here

645
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,530
always reminded me of your scent.

646
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,830
Just sitting here

647
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,560
would make me feel so happy.

648
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,830
How cheesy.

649
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,290
Why are you sighing?

650
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,160
Look at you.

651
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,300
Although you've become the royal advisor,

652
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,830
you have to be at odds with your uncle Yun Shang

653
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,200
and always be on guard against each other.

654
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,810
You and your sister...

655
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,590
Although I hate her in my heart,

656
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,430
I still can't completely separate

657
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,320
the elder sister who was once so good to me

658
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,630
from who she is now.

659
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes.

660
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,710
If it were so easy

661
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,360
to let go of human emotions,

662
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,670
there wouldn't be so many annoyances.

663
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,830
But once we've chosen

664
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,190
the path we want to take,

665
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,360
we must face the consequences, good or bad.

666
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,990
Right?

667
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,350
Is your hand still hurting?

668
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,610
It's almost healed.

669
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,290
Even if it's much better, you can't be careless.

670
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,220
You must be careful in everything.

671
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,890
Actually, I...

672
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,950
I'm still thinking about something.

673
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,850
If it weren't for the green flash,

674
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,760
would I already be gone?

675
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,230
I've thought about that too.

676
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,150
When Yun Shang harmed me back then,

677
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,990
if I hadn't seen that green flash,

678
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,300
I might have suffered more than just deafness.

679
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,520
We both saw the green flash at that time.

680
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,570
That's why I could hear your music.

681
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,780
Perhaps this is our destined fate.

682
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,180
So, the legend is true.

683
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,740
Once you see the green flash, a miracle will happen.

684
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,420
But after the green flash disappeared,

685
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,730
I couldn't find my jasper no matter what.

686
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,370
It seemed to have vanished into thin air.

687
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,450
The jasper got us reunited.

688
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,920
Its purpose has been fulfilled.

689
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,590
Even if the jasper is gone for good,

690
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,420
I'll stay by your side forever.

691
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,800
Who says I want you by my side?

692
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,430
You don't want me by your side?

693
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,490
Then who do you want to be by your side?

694
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,300
Alright, alright.

695
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,030
I want you to be by my side, okay?

696
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,850
Give me another kiss.

697
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,260
Is everything ready?

698
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,660
Yes, it's all prepared.

699
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,070
Proceed according to the plan.

700
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,800
Understood.

From this day forward,

you'll be the music minister of Dongsheng.

I hope you will be a model for all musicians

From this day forward,

727
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,580
the selection of musicians for all official workshops

728
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,930
will no longer be based on appearance

729
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,230
or family background.

730
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,030

Please, Green Flash Workshop, perform your piece.

Today, we are bringing you

737
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,220
my favorite piece of music,

the "Green Flash Song".

739
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,830

many important moments in my life.
