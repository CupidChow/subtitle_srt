00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,140
Chu.

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,020
Chu.

5
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,100
You can't hold your liquor.

6
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,190
Hurry.

7
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,120
Chu, sit up.

8
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,790
Let's continue drinking.

9
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,950
Drink with me.

10
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,430
Listen.

11
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,870
Don't worry about the audition.

12
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,550
-Everyone stands a chance.
-Waiter.

13
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,710
Coming.

14
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,660
A pot of water.

15
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,910
Okay.

16
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,740
Jin.

17
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,380
Are you

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,370
avoiding that girl?

19
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,120
Yes.

20
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,310
I wonder which one of us

21
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,780
can pass the audition and join Symphony Workshop.

22
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,590
It must be Wu.

23
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,670
He just passed the 2nd-level exam.

24
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,990
He can make use of this advantage

25
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,280
and become the winner.

26
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,630
I'm flattered.

27
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,510
I didn't come to Cloud City

28
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,190
wishing to be the winner.

29
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,590
I only hope to meet

30
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,110
Master Jin Shangyu.

31
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,110
Are you talking about Master Jin?

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,110
He is the best musician in the world.

33
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,440
I heard His Majesty has always wanted him to be the music minister.

34
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,180
It's a pity that Master Jin doesn't want fame.

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,230
He's a weirdo

36
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,440
and only wants to travel around.

37
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,420
Come on. Let's drink some tea.

38
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,740
Let's drink some tea.

39
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,150
-Let's drink some tea.
-Cheers.

40
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,710
Let's drink some tea.

41
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,980
Who are you calling a weirdo?

42
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,310
It's none of your business.

43
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,470
You can play the pipa?

44
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,060
Come on.

45
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,670
Play a song for me.

46
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,650
Just because you asked me to play...

47
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,900
Wait.

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,750
Who are you?

49
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,460
So domineering.

50
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,660
I'll play.

51
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:02,920
I'll play.

52
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,020
Is she always like this?

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,790
Hurry up.

54
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,700
I'll play.

55
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,850
It sounds terrible.

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,560
What is she doing?

57
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,680
My pipa!

58
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,660
What are you doing?

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,520
Why did you destroy his instrument?

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,990
Because you guys

61
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,190
spoke ill of Jin behind his back.

62
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,380
You…

63
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,230
You two,

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,070
give me your instruments.

65
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,980
Give them to me.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,630
No.

67
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,620
Give them to me!

68
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,300
Huang Ying.

69
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,740
Stop it.

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,010
Jin.

71
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,110
I didn't see you just now.

72
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,380
Jin.

73
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,160
It's only been a few days since I last saw you.

74
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,550
Why did you lose weight again?

75
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,590
No, I didn't.

76
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,260
You...

77
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,900
It's you.

78
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,230
You're Master Jin Shangyu.

79
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,480
Master Jin!

80
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,150
Jin.

81
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,220
So you are Master Jin Shangyu.

82
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,770
I've always regarded you as a role model.

83
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,030
I like you so much.

84
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,310
Who are you?

85
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,570
Why do you call him Jin?

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,940
Jin,

87
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,120
do you know her?

88
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,910
Huang Ying,

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,060
go and see

90
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,790
if his pipa can be repaired.

91
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,190
Fine.

92
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,980
It can be repaired...

93
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,360
Jin.

94
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,730
Jin!

95
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,700
No.

96
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,700
I can't run anymore.

97
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,140
Mr. Jin,

98
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,900
your stomach is rumbling.

99
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,730
I ran too fast just now.

100
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm hungry.

101
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,770
Hungry?

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm a bit tired.

103
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,360
Jin.

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,560
Come with me.

105
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,430
Jin.

106
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,920
Jin!

107
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,000
You can't get away!

108
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,590
Why didn't you wash both of your hands?

109
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,180
You held this hand.

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,370
I don't want to wash it.

111
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,590
Do you like me very much?

112
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,540
Of course.

113
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,390
Mr. Jin,

114
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,210
you are my number two role model.

115
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,770
Number two role model?

116
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,110
Who's the number one?

117
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,500
Madam Yaoshan.

118
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,020
Madam Yaoshan?

119
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,660
Then why did you try to assassinate her only son?

120
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,230
You tried to assassinate the Young Lord.

121
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,080

you were so capable.
[Wanted]

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,740
you were so capable.

126
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,790
I was wronged.

127
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
Given what you said,

128
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,560
it should be a misunderstanding.

129
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,010
I've met the Young Lord several times.

130
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,790
Perhaps I can intercede on your behalf.

131
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,990
Really?

132
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,820
I'll go back to Cloud City with you tomorrow morning.

133
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,870
Great.

134
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,980
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

135
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,190
You're as warmhearted and helpful

136
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,730
as I've heard.

137
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,670
By the way,

138
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,310
I had a childhood friend whose name was also Shangyu.

139
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,220
He was a chubby boy.

140
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,630
He wasn't as talented

141
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,420
and handsome as you.

142
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,060
Really?

143
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,200
Do you still play together?

144
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,600
No.

145
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,430
It's been more than a decade.

146
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,040
He left Cloud City,

147
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,840
and I haven't heard from him since then.

148
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,900
Given what you said,

149
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,430
you haven't seen each other for 10 years.

150
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,780
What if he has lost weight?

151
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,650
What if he has become someone like me?

152
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,760
That's impossible.

153
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,540
He was a head shorter than me.

154
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,390
He'll never look like you.

155
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,070
It's getting dark.

156
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,650
Let's go.

[Su Ruofei, boss of Green Flash Workshop, tried to assassinate Lord of Leisure and ran away]

159
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,740
You know what?

160
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,620
If it weren't for the wanted poster,

161
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,310
I would have almost failed to recognize you.

162
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,710
It's been 10 years.

163
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,030
You've changed.

164
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,830
Can't I change?

165
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,580
I'd like to see

166
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,380
when you can recognize me.

167
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,900
We finally made it.

168
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,670
Let's go.

169
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,340
Have you heard?

170
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,510
Boss Su has won five rounds in a row

171
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,220
and entered the final.

172
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,740
Musicians from private workshops also joined the competition.

173
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,100
No one could defeat Boss Su.

174
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,820
Musicians from official and private workshops

175
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,470
can compete together now?

176
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,750
Who is Boss Su?

177
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,220
My sister.

178
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,430
You have a sister?

179
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,510
Her name is Su Ruoshan.

180
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,860
She's the boss of Melody Workshop.

181
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,510
Let's go.

182
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,470
Mr. Jin,

183
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,470
hurry up.

184
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,190
Your sister

185
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,170
will win this round.

186
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,740
What do you think?

187
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,330
Isn't my sister awesome?

188
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,140
She's top-class,

189
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
but she's not the best.

190
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,740
In my opinion,

191
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,110
you're the best musician in the world.

192
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,830
Bravo! Bravo!

193
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,840
Bravo!

00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
She played so well.

195
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,590
Bravo!

196
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,860
Amazing.

197
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,500
I pronounce

198
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,140
Boss Su the winner.

199
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,280
Great!

200
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,830
Great!

201
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,790
Amazing!

202
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,670
Boss Su.

203
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,750
Yes. Wonderful.

204
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,020
Boss Su won.

205
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Mu, announce it.

206
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,210
If no one else wants to challenge Boss Su,

207
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,420
I'll announce...

208
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
I want to challenge her.

209
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
She wants to challenge Boss Su.

210
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,990
Who is she?

211
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,690
Can she defeat Boss Su?

212
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,150
Why is she here?

213
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,720
Now that she's here,

214
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,750
your sister will lose.

215
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,590
I want to challenge Boss Su.

216
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,780
She's that capable?

217
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,580
Just listen.

218
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,650
Young Lord,

219
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,830
I want to challenge Boss Su.

220
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,880
What challenge?

221
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,950
The time for challenges has passed.

222
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,180
You can't challenge her now.

223
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,410
Mu, announce it.

224
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,210
Sir,

225
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,340
what do you think?

226
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,390
According to the competition rules,

227
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,360
if there's a challenger within 10 rounds,

228
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,130
the winner must accept the challenge.

229
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,100
Boss Su has won nine rounds in a row.

230
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,380
If this girl wants to challenge Boss Su,

231
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,340
she has to accept the challenge.

232
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,510
How come there are so many rules?

233
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,100
Mayor, Young Lord,

234
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,790
I'm willing to accept the challenge.

235
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,440
Well...

236
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,540
Fine. You two compete.

237
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,620
Miss,

238
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,100
what's your name?

239
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm Huang Ying.

240
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,860
Huang Ying?

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,470
-Huang Ying?
-She is Huang Ying?

242
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,500
Why does her name sound so familiar?

243
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,180
When people hear Huang Ying's music,

244
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,350
they get hurt.

245
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,790
Is she the devil girl who went to every music workshop

246
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,600
to challenge musicians?

247
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,880
Are you the devil girl Huang Ying?

248
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,050
It seems I'm quite famous.

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,000
Even the Young Lord knows me.

250
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,140
Who is this girl?

251
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,180
Mayor,

252
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,630
it's said Huang Ying's pipa has magic power.

253
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,980
People who hear its sound will vomit blood.

254
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,960
Then

255
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,920
Shanshan will be in danger.

256
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,100
They can't compete.

257
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,770
We can't let this girl join the competition.

258
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,060
As you can see,

259
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,180
Boss Su doesn't dare accept my challenge.

260
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,200
Even the mayor of Cloud City has her back.

261
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,220
I think

262
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,290
the competition is fake.

263
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,700
There's no need to compete.

264
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,660
You can leave.

265
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,340
Boss Su,

266
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,530
don't be afraid of this devil girl.

267
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,430
Compete with her.

268
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,820
Yes.

269
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,100
Yes. Compete with her.

270
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,590
Compete with her.

271
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,590
Don't be afraid of her. Compete with her.

272
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,590
Don't be afraid of her. Show her your skills.

273
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,180
That's right.

274
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,430
Mayor,

275
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,420
I'm willing to compete with Huang Ying.

276
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,540
Fine. You two compete.

277
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm warning you.

278
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,460
If you hurt Shanshan,

279
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,540
I'll kill you.

280
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,930
Thank you, Young Lord,

281
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,140
Mayor.

282
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,450
Why is the music making me

283
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,990
have a tight chest?

284
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,200
Right, Mayor.

285
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,700
I want to throw up.

286
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,580
Shanshan,

287
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,890
what's wrong?

288
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,680
Sister.

289
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,920
What should we do?

290
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,220
What's that sound?

291
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,080
Where did that sound come from?

292
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,890
I have no idea.

293
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,340
It's you.

294
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,310
Not me.

295
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,930
Not me.

296
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,840
Boss.

297
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,920
Shanshan,

298
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,900
are you okay?

299
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,860
Let's go.

300
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,380
Jin,

301
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,220
bring that devil girl back.

302
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,940
Yes.

303
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,920
How do you feel? Are you okay?

304
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,490
[Huiyun Temple]

305
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,700
Don't do anything stupid.

306
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,630
I once tried to assassinate the Young Lord.

307
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,100
There are wanted posters for me.

308
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,380
What a coincidence!

309
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm on wanted posters, too.

310
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,830
How much is the bounty on you?

311
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,470
It's...

312
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,140
500 taels.

313
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,390
500 taels?

314
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,710
My enemy has put a bounty of 5,000 taels

315
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,810
on my head.

316
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,590
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

317
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,110
I...

318
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,920
I was just kidding.

319
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,000
Tell me.

320
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,190
Where is Jin?

321
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,380
Jin…

322
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,250
Mr. Jin?

323
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,740
I don't know.

324
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,270
You don't know?

325
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,580
But you were at the teahouse together.

326
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,380
Then you went into the forest.

327
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,950
Tell me.

328
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,980
Where is he?

329
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,890
He...

330
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,340
Mr. Jin.

331
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,900
Huang Ying.

332
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,860
What are you doing?

333
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,620
Jin.

334
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,710
Mr. Jin.

335
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,250
Let go of her!

336
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,910
Why do you care so much about her?

337
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,240
Do you like her?

338
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,180
Huang Ying!

339
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,220
Stop!

340
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,580
Are you alright, Ruofei?

341
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
Xiaoqi, catch her!

342
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,200
Ruofei.

343
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,850
Su Ruofei.

344
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,980
Let me see.

345
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,280
It turns out to be a retractable dagger.

346
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,800
It seems

347
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,550
that Huang Ying isn't as bad as I thought.

348
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,240
I was looking for you.

349
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,900
I heard that the competition has resumed at the private workshop.

350
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,330
Then why did you seal our music workshop?

351
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,940
You're targeting us deliberately.

352
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,060
You're wrong.

353
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,170
Not "us".

354
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm only targeting you.

355
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,670
Since I want you to be my private entertainer,

356
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,260
how could I

357
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
let you run a private music workshop?

358
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,340
Don't worry.

359
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,670
I won't be your private entertainer.

360
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,660
Xiaoqi.

361
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,790
Stop.

362
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,620
Mr. Jin.

363
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,600
Leave now.

364
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm not leaving.

365
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,960
Mr. Jin, are you alright?

366
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,780
I'm fine.

367
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,130
Stop it.

368
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,980
Mr. Jin.

369
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,020
I didn't expect that after I last saw you in Symphony City,

370
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,300
we would meet in Cloud City.

371
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,700
You look much thinner.

372
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,900
You still look handsome.

373
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,420
Actually, I came here

374
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,000
specially to see you.

375
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,230
I want to ask for a favor for Su Ruofei.

376
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,920
Ask for a favor for Su Ruofei?

377
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,420
You two know each other?

378
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,380
She...

379
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,540
She helped me once.

380
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,210
I want to repay her.

381
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,880
Young Lord, please show mercy.

382
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,300
Forgive her for the crime of assassination.

383
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,230
To show my sincerity,

384
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,100
I can promise to help at Symphony Workshop

385
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,110
before Jiuru Banquet.

386
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,860
Help at Symphony Workshop?

387
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,760
My father invited you many times before.

388
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,790
But you refused.

389
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,360
I can't believe you changed your mind for Su Ruofei.

390
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,700
It seems that the favor you owe

391
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,920
is very huge.

392
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,500
Since you've pleaded,

393
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,580
I agree.

394
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,500
But what's your relationship

395
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,940
with Ms. Huang?

396
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,130
She–

397
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,890
I'm his fiancée.

398
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,740
No.

399
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
She's my friend.

400
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,500
Your friend

401
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,140
disrupted the order of the music workshop.

402
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,860
Do you also want to help her?

403
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,960
When did I disrupt it?

404
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,870
The two of them cheated.

405
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,380
You...

406
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,860
They were versus me.

407
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,340
You affected Boss Su's mind with your music.

408
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,560
This is beyond the scope of the music competition.

409
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,540
I should take you to trial.

410
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,220
Unless

411
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,270
you also want to protect Ms. Huang.

412
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,800
Don't try to force him with me.

413
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,260
I wonder whether you want to protect Ms. Huang

414
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,370
or Su Ruofei?

415
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,020
Despicable!

416
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,500
I don't need your help.

417
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,060
Let them arrest me.

418
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,940
I don't believe

419
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,620
they'll kill me.

420
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,540
Mr. Jin.

421
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,400
You don't need to protect me.

422
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,820
If you protect me, you'll fall into his trap.

423
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,180
Mr. Jin.

424
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,940
Who will you choose?

425
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,860
Let's go inside.

426
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,940
Young Lord.

427
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,620
The people sent by Mayor are coming.

428
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,660
The people sent by Mayor are coming soon.

429
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,660
Mr. Jin, have you made up your mind?

430
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,340
You...

431
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,430
Huang Ying.

432
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,260
A wise choice.

433
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,780
Ms. Huang.

434
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,890
Leave Cloud City as soon as possible.

435
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,860
Otherwise, if you're caught next time,

436
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,660
it won't be easy for you to leave.

437
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,420
Jin.

438
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,660
I'll come to you again.

439
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,860
Leave.

440
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,580
Young Lord.

441
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,400
We were ordered to capture Huang Ying.

442
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,070
Where is that witch now?

443
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,800
That witch just ran up the mountain.

444
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,410
Go after her!

445
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,260
[Mayor's Mansion]

446
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,110
Listen.

447
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,620
You have two options now.

448
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,720
The first one

449
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,870
is to be my private entertainer

450
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,330
and go back to Symphony City with me.

451
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,240
I choose the second one.

452
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,300
I knew it.

453
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,250
The second one is death.

454
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,510
Not only you

455
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,880
but also your parents and sister have to die.

456
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,460
Just say one option.

457
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,580
What did you ask me to choose?

458
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,420
I know

459
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,580
you've been refusing to be my private entertainer

460
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,430
because you feel inferior.

461
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
But don't worry.

462
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,860
When we go back to Symphony City,

463
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,580
I'll train you slowly

464
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,700
so that you can stand in front of me with more confidence.

465
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,770
Wait.

466
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,020
What did you just say?

467
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,500
You said I feel inferior?

468
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,070
Why should I feel inferior?

469
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,670
If you don't feel inferior,

470
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,660
why did you turn me down again and again?

471
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,690
Why are you laughing?

472
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,870
Do you want to know

473
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,230
why I don't want to be your entertainer?

474
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,530
Tell me.

475
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,580
It's simple.

476
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,290
I hate you.

477
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,680
What did you say?

478
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,010
I hate you.

479
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,030
Why do you hate me?

480
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,780
There are too many reasons.

481
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,510
You sealed my music workshop,

482
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,300
forced me to be your private entertainer,

483
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,740
and slandered me with those wanted posters.

484
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,930
By the way,

485
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,280
you also threatened Mr. Jin.

486
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,280
Your actions.

487
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,180
If not–

488
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,030
Stop talking.

489
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,450
Let her talk.

490
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,450
In my eyes,

491
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,250
you're a selfish,

492
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,760
despicable, shameless,

493
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,140
and arrogant villain

494
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,980
who bullies people with powers.

495
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,140
What's more,

496
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,590
you're the most narcissistic person I've ever met.

497
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,530
Moreover,

498
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,670
you don't look good at all.

499
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,290
Young Lord.

500
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,390
Don't listen to her nonsense.

501
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,090
You're recognized as the most handsome man in Dongsheng.

502
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,020
You work for him.

503
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,340
Of course you have to say so.

504
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,620
In my opinion,

505
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,050
you're not nearly as good as Mr. Jin.

506
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,570
Is he so mad at me that he became crazy?

507
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Do you think I don't know what you're doing?

508
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,610
Do you think if you make me mad,

509
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,300
I won't ask you

510
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
to be my private entertainer?

511
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,500
Nice try.

512
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,170
I must have you.

513
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,500
In order to prove

514
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,150
that what you just said is wrong,

515
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,310
I can promise you

516
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,950
that if you perform well,

517
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,820
I'll help you regain your music status

518
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,680
and let you join Symphony Workshop.

519
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,110
Really?

520
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,610
Yes.

521
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,300
But you are not

522
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,380
trustworthy.

523
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,930
Besides believing me,

524
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,300
do you have other choices?

525
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,880
Forget it.

526
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,100
I'll be your entertainer.

527
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,890
But I have one more condition.

528
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,330
How dare you bargain with Young Lord?

529
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,850
My Green Flash Workshop was sealed.

530
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,080
You have to help me unseal it.

531
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,860
Where else can my friends go otherwise?

532
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,270
Sure.

533
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,050
Anything else?

534
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,170
It's a deal.

535
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,420
As long as I perform well,

536
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,620
you'll let me join Symphony Workshop.

537
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,450
Yes.

538
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,980
Wear this.

539
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,540
From now on, you belong to me.

540
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,720
But I have to remind you.

541
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,850
You can't go back on your word after wearing it.

542
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,720
Can I leave now?

543
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,320
Go back.

544
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,700
See you tomorrow.

545
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,780
Xiaoqi.

546
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,490
Am I a narcissist?

547
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,150
Be honest.

548
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,070
I think you're just confident.

549
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,530
Of course.

550
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,030
It's because you're good enough

551
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,130
that you can be so confident.

552
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,290
I knew it.

553
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,260
You have good taste.

554
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,130
I knew it.

555
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,970
She lied on purpose in order to piss me off.

556
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,950
When we return to Symphony City,

557
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,930
I'll improve her taste.

558
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,470
Yes.

559
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,740
[Su's Mansion]

560
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,540
Young Lord?

561
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,660
He's just a little devil.

562
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,860
He even asked me to be his private entertainer.

563
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,700
I'll suffer in the future.

564
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,790
Fei, you're back.

565
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,430
Sister.

566
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,020
Sister.

567
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,330
Are you okay?

568
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,740
Did the pipa sound hurt you?

569
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,500
I'm fine.

570
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,170
Are you okay?

571
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,050
I was going to Mayor's Mansion to look for you.

572
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,250
I heard that you're back.

573
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,360
So I came here immediately.

574
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,060
How is Young Lord going to deal with you?

575
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,460
He wants me to be his private entertainer.

576
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,220
That's too much.

577
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,570
You think you haven't caused enough trouble?

578
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,790
Be careful.

579
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm at my own home.

580
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,620
Can't I complain a little here?

581
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,250
I know you're upset.

582
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,890
But you did this to yourself.

583
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,650
I’ve made

584
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,460
every possible plea for you.

585
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,140
Be thankful

586
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,660
you've preserved your life.

587
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,740
Forget it.

588
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,330
Anyway, I'd rather go to Symphony City with him

589
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,260
than implicate you and our parents.

590
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,480
Good that you know.

591
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,780
Ruoshan.

592
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Your brooch is so beautiful.

593
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,740
Is it new?

594
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,530
As expected,

595
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,900
you have great taste.

596
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,560
By the way,

597
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,950
my jasper gemstone's missing.

598
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,580
I remember it was at Green Flash Workshop.

599
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,490
Melody Workshop's men sealed off the workshop.

600
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,360
Did they see my jasper?

601
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,690
They didn't mention it.

602
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,580
I've really lost it then.

603
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,370
It’s all Young Lord's fault

604
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,720
for bringing men to search my workshop.

605
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,900
Now I've lost

606
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,130
my jasper gemstone.

607
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,400
Ruoshan.

608
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,430
What if that petty guy

609
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,250
comes for me?

610
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,650
You caused this problem.

611
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,980
If you'd joined Melody Workshop

612
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,890
as I said,

613
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,210
this wouldn't have happened.

614
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,580
But...

615
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,850
It's been so long,

616
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
but that petty guy hasn't come once.

617
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,630
Maybe he has forgotten about it.

618
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,810
Why obsess over it?

619
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,190
Besides,

620
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,450
you're going to Symphony City soon.

621
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,300
You don’t know when you'd come back.

622
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,660
Even if this petty guy really comes,

623
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,970
you two can't meet.

624
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,180
Forget it.

625
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,700
But I made a promise to him...

626
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,840
Alright.

627
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,490
I'll be with you.

628
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,860
By the way,

629
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,700
stop mentioning

630
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,510
the jasper gemstone to Young Lord.

631
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,740
After all, as his private entertainer,

632
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,120
you must be cautious with everything.

633
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,490
Okay, okay.

634
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,980
I got it, Sister.

635
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,580
How did the audition go?

636
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,210
Made it?

637
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,780
I knew my sister's the best.

638
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,940
I envy you

639
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,560
for joining Symphony Workshop fair and square.

640
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,100
Ruoshan.

641
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,930
At Symphony City,

642
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,280
we can only rely on each other.

643
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,530
Don't worry.

644
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,020
No matter where you are,

645
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,360
I'll always be with you

646
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,580
and take good care of you.

647
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,020
Uncle.

648
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,820
I was going to see you.

649
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,500
Mu.

650
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,650
I was looking for you too.

651
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,020
At Symphony City,

652
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,300
take good care of Shanshan for me.

653
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,860
Don't let her be bullied.

654
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,770
Most of all,

655
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,360
keep an eye on her.

656
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,310
Don't let any man near her.

657
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,050
If anyone takes the slightest interest in Shanshan,

658
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,970
tell me.

659
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,400
I'll rush there right away.

660
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,140
Do you hear me?

661
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:23,880
I understand.

662
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,300
Do you really understand?

663
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,890
What do you mean?

664
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,050
Listen.

665
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm most worried about you.

666
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,840
You've been close

667
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,510
with Shanshan lately.

668
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,550
She's your future aunt.

669
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,940
No monkey business.

670
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,040
Got it?

671
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,190
I will protect her.

672
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,710
I heard

673
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,690
you took Su Ruofei in

674
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,920
as your new entertainer?

675
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,990
She is Shanshan's sister.

676
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,540
They are close.

677
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,650
Don't bully her.

678
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,110
Don't mess with her, you hear me?

679
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,810
Don't worry about this.

680
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,750
I will take good care of Su Ruofei.

681
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,470
But I wonder

682
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,090
when Shanshan would come back

683
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,020
from this trip

684
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,340
to Symphony City.

685
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,470
Life is boring in Cloud City

686
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,140
without Shanshan.

687
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,770
Uncle.

688
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,340
My father asked me to give you

689
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,050
this written edict before I leave.

690
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,570
My brother wrote to me?

691
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,080
Great!

692
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,580
I can go back too!

693
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,700
He's worried about your safety.

694
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,780
He wants me to protect you

695
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,660
along the way!

696
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,290
It's best to have you with me

697
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,430
on this trip.

698
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,400
But this means

699
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,450
the schedule has to be adjusted.

700
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,920
What's your plan?

701
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,450
Mayor, Young Lord.

702
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,130
Cloud City's been cloudy

703
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,410
and foggy lately.

704
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,340
The waters aren't safe.

705
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,580
Why don't we go by land instead?

706
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,100
I'll send more soldiers to protect you.

707
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,710
How's that?

708
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:01,860
Okay.

709
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't like your boat anyway.

710
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,990
It's so slow.

711
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,220
Go by land.

712
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,290
Okay.

713
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,060
I'll do as you say.

714
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,710
But it's inconvenient for my entertainers.

715
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,860
Let them go by boat.

716
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,090
It's inconvenient

717
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,470
with a group of women.

718
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,270
Let them take the boat.

719
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,100
I'll go back and pack up.

720
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,620
Let's leave tomorrow morning, okay?

721
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay.

722
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,220
Take care, Uncle.

723
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,260
Mayor!

724
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,790
I think this is the best chance.

725
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,400
You're right.

726
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,770
This is Shanshan's first trip.

727
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,060
She must be nervous.

728
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,530
With me by her side,

729
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,850
we might get closer.

730
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,640
What I mean is...

731
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,340
it's the best chance

732
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,020
to get rid of Yun Mu.

733
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,710
This again?

734
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,490
Mayor.

735
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,610
Based on the latest news from Symphony City,

736
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,090
His Majesty will appoint the royal advisor

737
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,940
at the Jiuru Banquet.

738
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,010
And 40% of the people

739
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,550
think it'll be Yun Mu.

740
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,340
And the other 60%?

741
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,540
You, Mayor.

742
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,040
That's settled then.

743
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,600
But we can't afford to fail.

744
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,240
I think I'll set up an ambush

745
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,210
along the way back.

746
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,830
If you...

747
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,070
My brother's over 20 years older than me.

748
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,680
When Mu wasn't born,

749
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,570
he treated me

750
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,630
like his own son.

751
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,260
I once saw him writing

752
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,490
an edict for me to be the royal advisor.

753
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,690
Then he stationed me in Cloud City, right?

754
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,420
It's to train me

755
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,430
to prepare to be the royal advisor.

756
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,770
But Mayor,

757
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,230
as you said,

758
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,690
Yun Mu wasn't born then.

759
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,770
It's different now.

760
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,830
I think

761
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,410
he'll surely appoint his own son.

762
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,440
Impossible.

763
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,340
I've guarded the border for over a decade

764
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,690
and earned great merits.

765
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,990
What has Yun Mu done?

766
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,810
As you saw,

767
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,660
when he came here,

768
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,500
he brought truckloads of entertainers.

769
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,210
This time, he took Su Ruofei in.

770
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,970
Besides having fun,

771
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,300
what else can he do?

772
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,770
What does he know about governance?

773
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,770
If he really appoints Mu as the royal advisor,

774
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,700
he'll be a laughingstock.

775
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,220
He who is no longer of use

776
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,860
will be abandoned.

777
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,300
Now that it's peaceful,

778
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,040
I doubt His Majesty wants

779
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,970
someone intense like you.

780
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,490
He only needs

781
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,810
a carefree young lord.

782
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,050
That's what you think.

783
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,920
Didn't he ask me to escort Mu

784
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,220
because he trusts me?

785
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,130
If anything happens to Mu,

786
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,690
do you think I'll be spared?

787
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,760
Sometimes I think

788
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,110
you're quite dense.

789
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:50,550

[Sealed off by Melody Workshop at dawn in April]

791
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,380
It seems you failed
[Sealed off by Melody Workshop at dawn in April]

792
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,540
[Sealed off by Melody Workshop at dawn in April]

793
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,000
to protect your dream without me.

794
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,580
It's okay.

795
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,620
I'm here now.

796
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,520
Fei.

797
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,320
I can't go up.

798
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,480
You're too fat.

799
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,140
If you keep getting fatter,

800
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,190
I won't play with you anymore.

801
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,680
Don't be too sad.

802
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,960
I'll tie a rope

803
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,570
so it'll be easy to climb.

804
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,370
Thank you, Fei.

805
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,440
Don't worry.

806
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,570
I will eat lesser meat buns.

807
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,260
Good boy.

808
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,590
By the way, Fei,

809
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,340
are you really quitting Melody Workshop?

810
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,320
Yes.

811
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,210
Melody Workshop

812
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,350
has too many rules.

813
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,250
You can't do this; you can't do that.

814
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,010
Besides,

815
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,100
we've to play according to the rules.

816
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,620
Music should be lively

817
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,250
like the wind or creeks.

818
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,400
How can it be dead

819
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,820
like stagnant water?

820
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,850
But if you quit,

821
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,450
where will you perform?

822
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,050
I can set up one myself.

823
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,590
Right here.

824
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,140
I'll build a workshop on this tree.

825
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,390
Then I can see the stars when I look up.

826
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,810
At night,

827
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,730
we'll light a bonfire here

828
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,940
and sing together around the fire.

829
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,210
That's more fun.

830
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,570
Do you want to join us?

831
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,220
Yes.

832
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,770
Then you're the first member

833
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,970
of my workshop.

834
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,000
What's the name of our workshop?

835
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,410
Green Flash Workshop.

836
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,170
Okay.

837
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,370
To not disgrace our workshop,

838
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,080
I'll practice hard.
