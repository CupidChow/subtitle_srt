[Echo of Her Voice]

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,350
[Episode 2]

3
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,590
I wonder why

4
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,400
must Young Lord insist on listening to Fei's performance.

5
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,750
I hope he doesn’t cause any trouble.

6
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
Cloud City's number 1 music workshop?

7
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,340
It's a waste of my time

8
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,990
listening to your performance.

9
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,240
Well...

10
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,310
Young Lord,

11
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,620
were you not satisfied with that part?

12
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,480
If you're not,

13
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,750
we can switch to something else.

14
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,910
No need.

15
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,860
What you guys were playing was just noise.

16
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,000
Listening to just one more minute

17
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,670
would be a torture to my ears.

18
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,830
A music workshop like yours

19
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,050
should be closed down.

20
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,800
Xiaoqi.

21
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,500
Let's go.

22
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,080
Yes.

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,990
Wait.

24
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,950
Young Lord, right?

26
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,000
I think you're simply deaf.

27
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,950
You...

28
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,670
What are you saying?

29
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,930
Please forgive us, Young Lord.

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,120
Apologize now.

31
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,050
Please forgive me.

32
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,060
What I meant was,

33
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,770
if you are not deaf,

34
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,810
how could you not like our music?

35
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,380
Right.

36
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,000
Right?

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,410
Why was this not dismantled?

38
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,080
Why... why didn't you dismantle it?

39
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,000
No, isn't this...

40
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,140
No, no.

41
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,090
It wasn't me.

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,400
Well, look.

43
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,040
What's going on?

44
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,260
You guys even set up a trap in advance

45
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,900
to try and harm me?

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,950
Don't accuse me of anything.

47
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,480
This was an accident.

48
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,560
This trap...

49
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,720
was meant to prevent others

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
from closing down our music workshop.

51
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
It wasn't targeted at you.

52
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,430
An accident?

53
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,350
How can you deny it when the evidence is so clear?

54
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,890
Xiaoqi.

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,450
Yes.

56
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,960
Catch the assassin now.

57
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,110
Fei!

58
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,620
How is it?

59
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,490
Catch me if you can!

60
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
You really think I can't catch you?

61
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,770
Come down and confess!

62
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,210
No, I will not.

63
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
You guys are accusing me!

64
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,190
Fei!

65
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,070
Don’t fool around!

66
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,860
Young Lord,

67
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
my sister is young and ignorant.

68
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,840
She didn't mean to offend you just now.

69
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,690
Are you really not coming down?

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,950
No.

71
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,920
Not until you stop accusing me,

72
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,170
and you reopen the music workshop for me.

73
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,320
No one has ever

74
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,560
tried to bargain with me.

[Mayor's Mansion]

110
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,000
What?

111
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,560
Weren't you pretty happy

112
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,080
when we were on the branch just now?

113
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
Why are you throwing up after the ride instead?

114
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,810
It's all because your ride was so bumpy.

115
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,360
You are the first one who

116
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
dares to talk to me like this.

117
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,560
No wonder you dared to assassinate me.

118
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
That is a...

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,600
I didn't.

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,640
That's a misunderstanding.

121
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,280
It's up to me to decide whether it's a misunderstanding or not.

122
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,240
According to the laws of Dongsheng,

123
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,160
those who try to assassinate me will have their hearts and eyes gouged out,

124
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,830
their entire family punished,

125
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,760
and be executed via prolonged torture.

126
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,450
What did you say?

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,840
The trap is just a misunderstanding.

128
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,120
How could that turn into an execution?

129
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,660
It's all because the guard next to you

130
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,730
threatened me with a knife.

131
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,650
Oh, right.

132
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,230
If he hadn't scared me in the first place,

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,640
I wouldn't have stepped on that trap.

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,720
Kill him if you want.

135
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,990
Kill him ruthlessly.

136
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,280
I can consider not killing you,

137
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,370
and let bygones be bygones.

138
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,520
But you have to promise me one thing.

139
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,560
Be my private entertainer.

140
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,630
Private entertainer?

141
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
For how long?

142
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,870
For as long as I tell you to.

143
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,790
So, isn't that akin to selling myself to you?

144
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,620
Absolutely not.

145
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,740
If you disagree,

146
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,130
I'll convict you for trying to assassinate me.

147
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,000
Go ahead then.

148
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,290
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

149
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,200
Fine.

150
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,840
Xiaoqi.

151
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,120
She will be executed at noon tomorrow.

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,740
Are you really going to execute me?

153
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,950
Of course.

154
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,560
Come in!

155
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,950
Wait.

156
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,770
W-wait!

157
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,760
Wait, wait!

158
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,050
Wait a minute!

159
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,540
Let's talk this over.

160
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,120
Regarding the duration...

161
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,420
One year?

162
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,430
Two years?

163
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,450
Four years?

164
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,670
Five years?

165
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,190
Five years, okay?

166
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Who was the one who just said,

167
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,260
"A soldier can be killed

168
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,760
but not humiliated?"

169
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,890
Take her away.

170
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,930
Help!

171
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm innocent!

172
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,050
Help!

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,140
Young Lord, you're disregarding human lives!

174
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,350
Mu!

175
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,450
Mu!

176
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,980
Mu!

177
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,100
Listen up.

178
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,560
If anything happens to Mu,

179
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,510
I won't forgive you!

180
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,530
Yes.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,210
Mu!

182
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,110
Mu!

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Mu!

184
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,110
Mu!

185
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,210
Are you okay, Mu?

186
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,120
Are you hurt anywhere?

187
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
What's wrong, Mu?

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,720
What's wrong, Mu?

189
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,460
Y-you're not hurt, are you?

190
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,590
Don't be afraid.

191
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,490
Uncle's here.

192
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
You're not hurt, right?

193
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,920
Uncle.

194
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm so scared!

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,020
Don't be afraid.

196
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,160
Uncle's here.

197
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,020
Let's go.

198
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,080
Let's go back now.

199
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,520
What's your name?

200
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,230
Xiaoqi.

201
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,910
What's your relationship with Master Wang?

202
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,210
He's a distant uncle

203
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,560
who raised me.

204
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,040
Did he ever tell you

205
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
why he let you enter the palace?

206
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,000
Even if I die...

207
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,040
Even if I die, I have to protect the prince.

208
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,680
I have to listen to him.

209
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,750
Xiaoqi.

210
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,440
If you tell others

211
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,630
what I am about to tell you,

212
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,610
I might die.

213
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,790
I... I won't tell anyone.

214
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,430
When I was in Cloud City,

215
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,180
I met with an accident.

216
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,060
I can't hear anymore.

217
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,520
From now on,

218
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,370
you are my ears.

219
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,640
You have to also teach me

220
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,990
how to lip read in six months.

221
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,850
Understand?

222
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,070
Yes.

223
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,980
Only two people

224
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,400
knew about this secret.

225
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,450
And that is only me and Master Wang.

226
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,070
From now on, only two people will know as well.

227
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,800
And that is you and me.

228
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,970
A third person must never come to know about it.

229
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,690
After Master Wang brought you in,

230
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,330
he...

231
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,740
Young Lord.

232
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,850
How is it going?

233
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,110
She's been locked up.

234
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,740
But... what are you going to do with her?

235
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,940
Are you really going to execute her?

236
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,030
Have you ever had a cat?

237
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,600
A cat?

238
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,400
If you want a cat to listen to you,

239
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
you have to scare it first.

240
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,770
I see.

241
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,410
Young Lord,

242
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,050
should we starve her for two days then?

243
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,300
I used to train horses.

244
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,570
No matter how wild it was, as long as I starve it for two days,

245
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,620
it will become good.

246
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,340
How can horses be the same as humans?

247
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,320
But... cats are not the same as humans too.

248
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,070
Shut up.

249
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,820
Lock her up for two days first.

250
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,690
Come with me to her place tomorrow.

251
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes.

252
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,780
[Su's Mansion]

253
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,280
Miss.

254
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Did you find out anything?

255
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,640
Miss,

256
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,920
they've managed to find out.

257
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,880
Lady Ruofei was detained by Young Lord.

258
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
She's locked up in the Mayor's Mansion.

259
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,400
Did they find out

260
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,930
what Young Lord plans to do with Fei?

261
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,920
She's just being locked up for now.

262
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,090
The mayor asked to pass a message just now.

263
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,960
He said he will go to Melody Workshop with Young Lord tomorrow.

264
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,650
I have to take this opportunity

265
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,810
to plead for Fei in front of Young Lord.

266
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,200
By the way,

267
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,840
deal with this as before.

268
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't tell our parents until we resolve it,

269
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,140
lest they worry.

270
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,500
Lady Ruofei is naughty.

271
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,640
She's getting more and more out of hand now.

272
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,320
She's not afraid of implicating you, Sir or Madam.

273
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,950
I am the one who spoilt her.

274
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,870
It's time she learn to control her temper.

275
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,060
You go first.

276
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,790
[Su's Mansion]

277
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,690
Don't be nervous, Mr. Su.

278
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,360
Please sit.

279
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm here today

280
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,510
to talk about how your daughter, Su Ruofei,

281
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,480
tried to assassinate me.

282
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,240
Yes, okay.

283
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,330
Assassinate?

284
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,980
Assassinate?

285
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,490
Young Lord.

286
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,160
Young Lord.

287
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,210
Young Lord.

288
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,620
It's all my fault for not teaching her well.

289
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,040
Young Lord,

290
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,060
kill me if you want.

291
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,790
Please rise, Mr. Su.

292
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,180
Of course, I can choose not to kill her.

293
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,870
But I have one condition.

294
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,580
Young Lord, what is it?

295
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,730
We will agree to any condition.

296
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,060
I want Su Ruofei to be my private entertainer,

297
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
and go back to Symphony City with me.

298
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,240
S-So... she just needs to be an entertainer?

299
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,280
Nothing else?

300
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,030
What else do you want her to do?

301
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,060
No problem.

302
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,210
It's rare that you cherish her talent.

303
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,030
That's her blessing.

304
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,930
If we make this long journey to Symphony City,

305
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,930
I can't guarantee

306
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,510
when she will come back.

307
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,080
Can you accept that?

308
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,320
That...

309
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,240
Birds that follow the phoenix will fly far.

310
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,970
It is might not be a bad thing for Fei

311
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,850
to follow you to Symphony City

312
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,110
and get some training.

313
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,870
Moreover, she has caused such trouble.

314
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,250
It’s her luck that you chose to spare her.

315
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,780
How can we not accept it?

316
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,380
In that case,

317
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,740
I have a few questions for you.

318
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,650
Go ahead.

319
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,570
Who taught Su Ruofei's music?

320
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,580
Both my daughters

321
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,320
picked up their skills at Melody Workshop.

322
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,190
But Fei has her own ideas since young,

323
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,590
and she wouldn't listen to me.

324
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,850
She left after staying there for less than a year.

325
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,530
She even abandoned the rank of Qingyin.

326
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,740
Su Ruofei actually passed the Qingyin exam?

327
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,510
Yes, when she was just 10 years old.

328
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,130
She passed the exam at aged 10.

329
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,760
My eldest daughter joined Melody Workshop afterwards,

330
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,810
and stayed there ever since.

331
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,500
Now, she has become the owner of Melody Workshop.

332
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,110
Does Su Ruofei have any other hobbies

333
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,900
besides music?

334
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,080
No.

335
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,150
She doesn't like staying at home.

336
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,570
She always goes to the Green Flash Forest.

337
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,310
She hasn't been home much these past two years.

338
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,380
She has been focused on running her workshop.

339
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,320
We tried to persuade her before.

340
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,050
Later, we found that she really liked doing it,

341
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,560
so we let her go.

342
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,850
You said she's often at Green Flash Forest.

343
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Did she ever have

344
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,480
any special encounters?

345
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,920
Well...

346
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,680
It seems that there's nothing strange

347
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,720
about Su Ruofei.

348
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,140
Then how come I can hear her music?

349
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,870
Maybe God has opened his eyes,

350
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,320
and sent someone to

351
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,960
relieve you from the pain of your deafness?

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,600
Young Lord,

353
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,000
perhaps you can recover your hearing after listening

354
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,320
to Su Ruofei perform for a few more days?

355
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,650
That's possible.

356
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,310
It seems that I have to keep her by my side.

357
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,050
Then tell me

358
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,310
why she doesn't want to be my private entertainer?

359
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,240
I think...

360
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,400
it's because she wants to run her own music workshop.

361
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
She's scared.

362
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,470
Scared?

363
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,440
My brilliance must be too overwhelming.

364
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,500
She must be afraid that if she stays by my side,

365
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,360
she will be hurt by my brilliance.

366
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,780
I... think there's another reason.

367
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,550
Actually, she is

368
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,900
not to blame for this matter too.

369
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,710
I know.

370
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,310
Even though you've been with me for so long,

371
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,600
you still feel a lot of pressure.

372
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,770
There's some pressure,

373
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,490
but...

374
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,960

565
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
and be qualified to enter Symphony Workshop,

566
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,290
and return to Symphony City with me.

567
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,570
The winner of the Symphony Workshop competition

568
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,380
will play a song at for Madam Yaoshan

569
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,370
at Jiuru Banquet,

570
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,380
and earn the title of the new music minister.

571
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,490
Great!

572
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,470
All right.

573
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,480
You know the rules.

574
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,890
Go and prepare for the competition

575
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,090
happening three days later.

576
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,840
Yes.

577
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,540
Yes.

578
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,830
Shanshan.

579
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,360
Uncle.

580
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,280
I heard you ordered

581
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,760
to close down all of Cloud City's private workshops.

582
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,960
Yes.

583
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,880
How good can those people be?

584
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
But Father ordered

585
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,740
to choose the best musicians of Dongsheng.

586
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,300
If we only choose from the official workshop,

587
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,460
the people would think

588
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,930
we're being unfair.

589
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,910
What about being unfair?

590
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,570
Those people in the private workshops are all thugs.

591
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,810
What's there to hear?

592
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,250
Besides,

593
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,150
we own Symphony Workshop.

594
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,090
We have the final say

595
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,230
on what the rules will be.

596
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,090
Uncle.

597
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:20,840
Enough.

598
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,930
Boss Su.

599
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,520
Yes.

600
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,120
Would you be willing to

601
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,170
compete with the musicians from private workshops,

602
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,680
and have a fair fight for the championship?

603
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,330
I'm willing to.

604
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,540
Shanshan.

605
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,490
Mayor.

606
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,320
Do you not trust my abilities?

607
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,210
Of course I trust you.

608
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,240
I just can't bear to

609
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,730
let you waste so much effort.

610
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,730
Thank you, Mayor.

611
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
But I, Ruoshan,

612
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,280
wants to compete fairly and squarely.

613
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,680
Uncle, look.

614
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,970
Please give the order then.

615
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,570
Private workshops and Melody Workshop will compete

616
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,360
in three days.

617
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,840
Xiaoqi.

618
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,920
This golden ribbon

619
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,170
will be temporarily kept by Melody Workshop.

620
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,570
Yes.

621
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
[Liuyin Pavilion]

622
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,820
I didn't expect you to have such an encounter.

623
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,110
I thought the green flash was just a legend.

624
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,370
Turns out, it's true.

625
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,050
Yes.

626
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,210
And the green flash is just like the legend.

627
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,610
It can cure people.

628
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,440
That boy had already vomited blood and fainted.

629
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,970
but he woke up immediately

630
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,750
after the green flash shone on him.

631
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,450
No wonder so many sick people

632
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,970
would head towards Green Flash Forest.

633
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,570
They must want to see the green flash.

634
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,880
I guess there's something magical about the green flash.

635
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,880
If you see it, you will reap a miracle.

636
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,730
Then this is called...

637
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,890
Jasper.

638
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,130
I named it.

639
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,530
Did this jasper

640
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,810
grow after the green flash disappeared?

641
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,810
Yes.

642
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,570
So I think this jasper

643
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,570
has something to do with the green flash.

644
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,370
But that petty chap

645
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,890
wanted to take the bigger half.

646
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,840
I saw that he was injured,

647
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,180
so I gave it to him.

648
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,690
You're so kind.

649
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,840
What happened to that boy?

650
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,700
He should have gone home.

651
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,320
He doesn't seem to be a person of Cloud City.

652
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,910
But we had a deal.

653
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,650
If he comes to Cloud City again,

654
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,880
we'll use this jasper to recognize each other.

655
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,580
Boss Su.

656
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,970
Boss Su.

657
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,890
Young Lord.

658
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,080
Can I come in?

659
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,620
Please come in.

660
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,050
Mayor didn't come with you?

661
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,650
Uncle has something to do at home,

662
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,720
so he went back first.

663
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,200
I came here

664
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,890
to finish what I didn't manage to say.

665
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,050
I was just about to ask you too.

666
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,930
This jasper is an extremely private matter.

667
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,800
How did you know?

668
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,920
You said it’s private matter.

669
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,810
If I hadn't experienced it,

670
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,310
how would I know?

671
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,210
Are you the petty chap

672
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,210
who took the bigger half of the jasper away?

673
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,280
Petty chap?

674
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,360
I'm sorry.

675
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,130
I was too willful back then,

676
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,640
and took the bigger half away.

677
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,780
Even if you call me a petty chap,

678
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,790
there's really nothing wrong with that.

679
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,810
We promised

680
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,690
to meet each other again with this jasper.

681
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,860
I've lived up to my promise.

682
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,220
I didn’t know who you were back then.

683
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,570
Please forgive me

684
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,900
if I had been rude.

685
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,400
Open it.

686
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,330
This time,

687
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,450
besides choosing musicians for my father,

688
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I also came to Cloud City to look for you.

689
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,860
I got someone to carefully make

690
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,100
this jade brooch

691
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,600
after leaving Green Flash Forest.

692
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,580
I kept it with me for many years,

693
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,010
with hopes that when we meet again,

694
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
I can personally give it to you.

695
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,410
Since you're going to take part in the audition,

696
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,570
I hope you will be the one

697
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,790
that follows me back to Symphony City.

698
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,620
I, Ruoshan, will not let you down, Young Lord.

699
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,240
Young Lord,

700
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,640
I have a favor to ask you.

701
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,150
Sure.

702
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,090
Go ahead.

703
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,490
My sister accidentally offended you yesterday,

704
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,080
and committed the crime of disrespect.

705
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,610
Please forgive her this time,

706
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,800
seeing that she didn't mean it.

707
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,080
She tried to assassinate me.

708
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,870
That's a crime punishable by execution.

709
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,440
Well...

710
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,080
But seeing that Su Ruofei

711
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,560
is your younger sister,

712
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,490
I can spare her life.

713
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,470
She can be pardoned,

714
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,920
but she can't escape punishment.

715
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
Forget it.

716
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,850
I ask that she stay by my side,

717
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,030
and be my private entertainer to atone for her sins.

718
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
Private entertainer?

719
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,620
But don't worry, Boss Su.

720
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,990
I won't give her a hard time.

721
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,150
Thank you for your benevolence.

722
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,750
It's a blessing in diguise for Fei

723
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,370
to be able to by your side.

724
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,660
But how long will she be your

725
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,770
private entertainer for?

726
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,420
That depends on her performance.

727
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,010
Why does Young Lord want to bring Fei back to Symphony City?

728
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,530
It seems that I have to work harder in order to

729
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,610
enter Symphony Workshop.

730
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,840
In that way, I can take care of Fei

731
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,410
when we're at Symphony City.

732
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,310
I'm sure you will do well.

733
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,310
We found her.

734
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,640
She really didn't go home.

735
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,420
Just as I guessed,

736
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,450
she was up to no good.

737
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,710
She really ran away?

738
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,280
I didn't realise she had such an inferiority complex.

739
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,470
She's so afraid to stay by my side.

740
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,080
Young Lord,

741
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,440
I don’t think it’s about her inferiority complex.

742
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,800
If not, what else could it be?

743
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,530
How about this?

744
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,290
Go to my uncle

745
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,760
and ask him to issue a warrant.

746
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,710
Let's find her first.

747
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Maybe if Su Ruofei had seen it,

748
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,160
she would run back in fear.

749
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,670
Young Lord,

750
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,360
I think

751
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,560
even if Su Ruofei comes back,

752
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,280
she also wouldn't listen to you well.

753
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,200
It's only interesting if she's disobedient.

754
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,800
It was quite pleasant to sleep deep in the forest

755
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,170
and under the stars at night.

756
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,340
But Young Lord wouldn’t help me.

757
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,250
No.

758
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,270
I have to think of another way.

759
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,510
Let's eat first.

760
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,290
What does it say?

761
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,130
Wanted?

762
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,120
Su Ruofei.

763
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,680
The workshop?

764
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,410
The boss of Green Flash Workshop?

765
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,520
Yes, yes.

766
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,170
It's her.

767
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,810
The boss of Green Flash Workshop, Su Ruofei

768
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,610
has escaped from her attempt at assassinating Lord of Leisure.

769
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,880
Young Lord actually put out an arrest warrant for me?

770
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,940
I thought I would be fine after hiding for two days.

771
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,220
How could I ever meet her?

772
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,250
Reward of 50?

773
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,190
[Reward of 10,000 taels of silver]

774
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,890
That's a big difference.

775
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,370
I'm that worthless?

776
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,050
That's a serious crime.

777
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,410
Have you seen this person?

778
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,410
No.

779
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,490
What about you?

780
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,210
No. Let's try.

781
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,200
Soldiers?

782
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,530
Yes, sir. Let's go.

783
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,920

784
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,240
Bro.

785
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,200
Could we share a table?

786
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,080
Don't worry.

787
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,520
I'm not a bad guy.

788
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,380

789
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,130
I'll split the cost with you.

790
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,290
Have you seen this person?

791
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:47,990
No.

792
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,030

No.

799
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,770
What about you? Have you seen her?

800
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,470
Come with me.

801
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,340
No.

802
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,510
What a wasted trip.

803
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,360
Let's go to the next place.

804
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,060

807
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,820
It's nothing.

808
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:34,680
How do I address you?

809
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,080
My surname is Jin.

810
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,010
Jin?

811
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
"Jin", as in to come in?

812
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,710
Jin,

813
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,900
thank you for helping me just now.

814
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
I'll treat you to a meal.

815
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:48,910
Sure.

816
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:49,940
Let's go.

817
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,280
Jin.

818
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,880
Order whatever you want.

819
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,660
No need.

820
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,790
These two plates are enough.

821
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,070
Just these two?

822
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,050
There are buns over there too.

823
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,850
