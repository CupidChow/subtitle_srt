00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,410
[Episode 19]

3
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,650
Madam, you're still up.

4
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,460
What are you doing

5
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,610
up so late?

6
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,960
I finally met the person I'd been missing for so long.

7
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,890
I'm too excited to sleep.

8
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,480
What about you?

9
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,840
Why are you up so late?

10
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,380
I...

11
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,340
I came out to look at the stars.

12
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,910
Is that not allowed?

13
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,250
If you're here to look at the stars,

14
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,770
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

15
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,190
There are so many dark clouds.

16
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,110
It might rain.

17
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,270
Rain?

18
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,410
Then you...

19
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,770
Then I...

20
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,420
Then enjoy

21
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,550
the baptism of rain.

22
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,200
Feel free to leave anytime.

23
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,960
Good night.

24
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,570
Your Highness.

25
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,930
It looks like it's about to rain.

26
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,260
If it starts raining,

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,380
I'm afraid your canopy will collapse.

28
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,870
Is it really going to rain?

29
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,990
That would be great.

30
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,890
Xiaoqi.

31
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,760
Do you want to bet?

32
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,070
On what?

33
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,460
That Ruofei won't have the heart

34
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,140
to keep me out.

35
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,930
Your Highness.

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,390
It's been an hour.

37
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,070
I don't think she'll come out.

38
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,080
Faith can move mountains.

39
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,510
Let's wait a bit longer.

40
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,080
Your Highness.

41
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,550
Are you done?

42
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,410
Are you done?

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,730
Thank you.

44
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,910
I called you so many times,

45
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,240
but you didn't respond.

46
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
Have a drink to warm yourself up.

47
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,110
Okay.

48
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,050
You've been living here since you came back?

49
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,680
Ruofei and I grew up

50
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,020
in this forest.

51
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,760
Coming back here

52
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,830
is like coming home.

53
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,480
You grew up with Ruofei.

54
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,430
Is she different from the person she was

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,420
as a child?

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,810
She was free-spirited even when she was just a child.

57
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,590
She was not afraid of anything.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,070
She always had

59
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,750
strange ideas in her mind.

60
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,900
She played hide-and-seek with us

61
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,270
and took us on adventures and fishing.

62
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,280
She loved to climb trees the most.

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
She once said

64
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,250
that as long as she stood high enough,

65
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,710
the entire Green Flash Forest would be hers.

66
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,690
In this forest,

67
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,950
there's no place she hasn't been.

68
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,500
She really hasn't changed a bit.

69
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,450
Cheers.

70
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,440
But I heard

71
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,920
you were chubby when you were young.

72
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,990
What?

73
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,820
Are you here today

74
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,770
to expose my shortcoming?

75
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,340
No.

76
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm here to expose my own shortcoming.

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
Actually, I'm deaf.

78
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,170
I think you're crazy.

79
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,650
Just now, you asked me

80
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,170
why I didn't respond when you called me.

81
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,870
I didn't mean to ignore you.

82
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,830
I really can't hear.

83
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,200
When I was 10,

84
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,530
I was being hunted

85
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,210
by my uncle's men in this forest.

86
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,260
Fortunately, a little girl appeared.

87
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,040
She guided me with her music,

88
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,420
helping me evade the assassins.

89
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,450
Although I survived,

90
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,000
I lost

91
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,460
my hearing.

92
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,360
To keep this secret from those people,

93
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,200
I learned to read lips.

94
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,770
Also, I pretended to be a playboy

95
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,510
and became the Lord of Leisure.

96
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,090
I did all these to prevent my uncle

97
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,000
from being suspicious and jealous of me.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,030
Later, I came to Cloud City to select musicians.

99
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,750
Actually, I had an ulterior motive.

100
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,990
I wanted to find the girl

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,740
who saved me back then.

102
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
However, unexpectedly,

103
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,280
I met Ruofei at that time.

104
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,060
After being in my silent world for a long time,

105
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,580
I heard her music for the first time.

106
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,710
So, I tried every possible way

107
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,440
to keep her by my side

108
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,790
and make her my entertainer.

109
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,960
I didn't know she was the girl who saved me

110
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,280
until the day I was attacked

111
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,860
at my mansion.

112
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,190
Perhaps it was fate.

113
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,070
God must have seen how lonely I was,

114
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,380
so he sent Ruofei to save me.

115
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,560
Why are you telling me this?

116
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,480
Because the danger isn't over.

117
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,130
If Yun Shang still can't find

118
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,260
a way to get rid of me,

119
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,630
I'm afraid he'll target Ruofei.

120
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,630
He wants to harm Ruofei?

121
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,460
So,

122
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,490
this is why you came to Cloud City?

123
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,220
Yes.

124
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,160
I don't want to get Ruofei involved.

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
But now that she's already involved,

126
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,220
I must stay by her side

127
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,120
to protect her from any harm.

128
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
Most importantly,

129
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,790
if anything happens to me,

130
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,440
I'll need you to protect her.

131
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,280
Don't worry.

132
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,300
Even if you're not here,

133
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
I'll protect her.

134
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,830
Madam.

135
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,390
You went out so early.

136
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,560
What?

137
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,460
Do I need to ask for your permission

138
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,920
to go out and do something?

139
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,230
No.

140
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,480
That's not what I meant.

141
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,600
I just wanted to say if there's anything to be done,

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,640
just ask me to do it.

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,170
You don't need to go out and do it yourself.

144
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,790
You wiped the table quite clean.

145
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,430
Is the water for washing faces ready?

146
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,100
Yes.

147
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,680
I've already taken it to everyone's room.

148
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,420
Have you chopped firewood?

149
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,030
Yes.

150
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,330
Have you filled the vat with water?

151
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,010
Yes.

152
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,110
Is breakfast ready?

153
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,970
Everyone's waiting.

154
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,700
The porridge is ready.

155
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,790
And I bought some steamed buns

156
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,170
at the market.

157
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,340
When everyone wakes up,

158
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,740
I'll bring the buns over.

159
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,950
Very good.

160
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,590
Then clean everyone's instrument

161
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,710
again.

162
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,500
I...

163
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,730
Your Highness.

164
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,940
Any news?

165
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,030
Yes.

166
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,200
I've found out who spread the rumor.

167
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,080
Who?

168
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,850
It's a girl named Shuangxi.

169
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,980
She bribed those people

170
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,040
to spread the rumor everywhere.

171
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Shuangxi?

172
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,380
Shuangxi?

173
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,540
She...

174
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,750
She is...

175
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,150
She's a maid of my family.

176
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,470
She used to be my sister's personal maid.

177
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,410
Even after I returned to Cloud City, she still won't leave me alone.

178
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,390
Don't worry. I'm here.

179
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,880
I'll take care of this.

180
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,460
You're here?

181
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,790
Weren't you also there in Symphony City?

182
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,150
I still ended up in jail

183
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,480
and was expelled from Symphony Workshop.

184
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,650
Your Highness.

185
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,860
What are you doing this for?

186
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,350
It seems

187
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,960
Su Ruoshan is indeed behind this.

188
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,870
But I still can't understand

189
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,230
why she's treating Su Ruofei like this.

190
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,430
She's probably the only one

191
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,870
who knows the reason.

192
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,470
I've been worried

193
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,710
that Su Ruoshan might have already colluded

194
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,160
with Yun Shang,

195
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,540
and this might be their scheme.

196
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,350
Xiaoqi.

197
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,190
Have you found out Jin's whereabouts?

198
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,790
Not yet.

199
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,430
But I've sent secret guards

200
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,870
to watch the Mayor's Mansion.

201
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,130
They haven't seen him.

202
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,710
He must still be in Cloud City.

203
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,850
Keep investigating.

204
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,410
Yes.

205
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,390
This time, I openly

206
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,810
joined Green Flash Workshop

207
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,160
to protect Ruofei

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,560
and to force them out.

209
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,300
Let's see how patient they are.

210
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,550
If they come during the day, it won't be a problem.

211
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,680
If they launch a sneak attack at night,

212
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,830
it might be hard for us to guard against it.

213
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,690
How about this?

214
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,110
I'll ask Huang Ying

215
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,230
to stay with Ruofei over the next few days.

216
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,860
No need.

217
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,740
I'll sleep outside Ruofei's room.

218
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,130
If there's any danger,

219
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,610
it will come to me first.

220
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,720
I'd die

221
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,830
before I let anyone harm her.

222
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,630
Tell Jin

223
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,080
to proceed with his plan,

224
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,090
but also tell him to remain patient

225
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,690
and only take action when everything's ready.

226
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,510
Cloud City is our turf.

227
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,030
We can't let anything go wrong again.

228
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,780
Got it.

229
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,550
You may go.

230
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,720
My Lord.

231
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,270
My Lord.

232
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,870
Shanshan.

233
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,730
You came at the right time.

234
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,200
Jin just sent a letter.

235
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,430
Is there any news from Cloud City?

236
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,700
Yun Mu has joined Green Flash Workshop

237
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,700
and become Su Ruofei's music apprentice.

238
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,940
He's going all out

239
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,280
for Su Ruofei, isn't he?

240
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,410
I'm only worried about one thing.

241
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,850
Although I suggested

242
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,410
transferring Yun Mu to Cloud City,

243
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,260
I'm worried His Majesty will blame you

244
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,190
if Yun Mu gets killed in Cloud City.

245
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,470
Don't worry about that.

246
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,770
Jin's going to make the assassination

247
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,880
look like an accident.

248
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,150
Of course,

249
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,510
my brother will still blame me.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
But by then, Yun Mu will already be dead.

251
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,350
So what if my brother blames me?

252
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,880
I'll ask the officials to plead for me.

253
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,580
The worst-case scenario is I'll get a few hundred stokes.

254
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,680
When I recover,

255
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,760
I'll be the only choice

256
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,530
for royal advisor.

257
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,290
What's wrong?

258
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,190
Is there something on my face?

259
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,380
No.

260
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,260
I just think you've changed.

261
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,090
You've become more composed.

262
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,980
I can't believe you're still coming after me

263
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,280
after I returned here.

264
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,440
Does our sisterly bond

265
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,380
mean nothing to you?

266
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,140
Ruofei.

267
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,210
What do you want?

268
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,370
Ruofei.

269
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,220
Ruofei.

270
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,910
Whatever it is, let's talk tomorrow.

271
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,030
I'm going to sleep.

272
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,190
There's something important.

273
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,350
Use this red silk as a precaution

274
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,490
like we did before.

275
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,000
You want to guard against me?

276
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,450
It's for you to guard against me.

277
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,670
I'm afraid I can't help

278
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,430
coming in to see you at night.

279
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,030
With this red silk,

280
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,950
you can get prepared in advance.

281
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,670
I don't want it.

282
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm warning you.

283
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,150
There's no door here.

284
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,750
Don't try to take advantage.

285
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,960
If you don't want me to take advantage,

286
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
wind the red silk around your wrist.

287
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,600
Rascal.

288
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,310
That's it?

289
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,790
What now?

290
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,910
If you get thirsty or hungry at night,

291
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,570
remember to pull the red silk.

292
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,660
I'll be outside

293
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
at your beck

294
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,550
and call.

295
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,740
That's it?

296
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,150
With this,

297
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,650
if anything happens to you,

298
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,100
I'll be able to sense it.

299
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,860
Your Highness.

300
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,660
Put it here.

301
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,490
You're in a good mood today.

302
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,940
Keep your voice down.

303
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,320
Don't disturb Ruofei.

304
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,790
Has Ms. Su forgiven you?

305
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,110
Not yet.

306
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,640
But I've discovered

307
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,310
that Ruofei still has feelings for me.

308
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,920
Y-Your Highness!

309
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,350
I almost got myself burned.

310
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,560
Luckily, the strip is long enough.

311
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,980
Otherwise, you would have been burned.

312
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,690
Yes.

313
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,450
What did you just say?

314
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,540
Otherwise, you would have been burned.

315
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,600
No, the other part.

316
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,520
Luckily, the strip is long enough.

317
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,000
I've figured it out.

318
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,740
Ruofei.

319
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,110
Who let you in?

320
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,270
I finally know

321
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,870
how your sister set the fire.

322
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,360
So?

323
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,980
How did she do that?

324
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,440
Be patient.

325
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,590
Just watch.

326
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,660
Do you understand now?

327
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,870
Actually, she just needed to put a fuse

328
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,570
inside the candle in advance.

329
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,550
When the candle burned

330
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,790
to where the fuse was,

331
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,000
the fuse would be ignited,

332
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,910
so would

333
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,330
the instruments that had been soaked in lamp oil.

334
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,360
The entire instrument room would be set on fire.

335
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,180
The arsonist didn't need to be there.

336
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,840
That's why my sister and Minister Ling

337
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,270
arrived at the same time.

338
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,260
She arranged to meet me at 5 PM

339
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,120
because she knew the candle

340
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,270
would burn to where the fuse was at that time,

341
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,470
and its flame would ignite the fuse.

342
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,680
But we're just speculating.

343
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,290
We don't have any evidence.

344
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,540
This wooden board was found by Wu Wei and Liu Xinnian

345
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,870
in the instrument room.

346
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,500
Usually,

347
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,070
after a candle burns out,

348
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,330
it leaves a pool of wax.

349
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,630
However, there's only a thin layer of wax

350
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,920
on this wooden board.

351
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,830
This means someone

352
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,150
went to the instrument room afterward

353
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,150
and directly removed the evidence.

354
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,560
Turns out you're still investigating this matter.

355
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,820
Now,

356
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,880
I can finally prove your innocence.

357
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,310
What's the use of proving my innocence?

358
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,870
I'm in Cloud City now.

359
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,500
Who can I prove it to?

360
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,990
But anyway,

361
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,510
thank you

362
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,130
for thinking about this matter all the time.

363
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,040
Get some rest.

364
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,100
I'll go back now.

365
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,490
Your Highness.

366
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,360
I heard everything just now.

367
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,650
You're really amazing.

368
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,250
You could even see through this kind of scheme.

369
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,980
Had I seen through it earlier,

370
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,870
Ruofei wouldn't have had to suffer so much.

371
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,430
Your Highness,

372
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,420
don't blame yourself too much.

373
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,920
I believe Ms. Su will understand

374
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,050
your feelings for her sooner or later.

375
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,590
I'll keep waiting

376
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,550
until Ruofei can accept me again.

377
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,280
[Green Flash Workshop]

378
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,760
Breakfast will be ready soon.

379
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,800
Eat a bit more today.

380
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,090
Good morning.

381
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,630
Mu,

382
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,170
is the porridge ready?

383
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,140
Porridge!

384
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay.

385
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,750
The porridge will be ready soon.

386
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,590
M-Mu,

387
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,560
there's no water in the vat,

388
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,050
and we're out of firewood.

389
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,130
When we practice later,

390
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,630
ask him to fill the vat with water

391
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,960
and chop firewood.

392
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,260
Okay.

393
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,940
Mu.

394
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,460
Mu.

395
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,880
I'm calling you. Are you...

396
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,110
Enough.

397
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,610
You keep calling him Mu.

398
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,510
Can't you do those things yourself?

399
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,710
Don't you have hands?

400
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,880
What are you looking at?

401
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,030
You three

402
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,930
keep calling him Mu.

403
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,750
You've been spoiled and now you want more, right?

404
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,690
Well,

405
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,770
it was you who told us to call him Mu.

406
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,920
He's a music apprentice.

407
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,470
I...

408
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,670
Coming.

409
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,900
Here's the porridge.

410
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,560
What's wrong?

411
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,450
Yes, he's a music apprentice.

412
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,840
He's my music apprentice!

413
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,710
I'll ask him to do things for me

414
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,820
when I need to.

415
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,220
But

416
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,990
who gave you the right

417
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,180
to order him around?

418
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,470
What are you looking at?

419
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,600
Go fetch some water.

420
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,610
Okay.

421
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,770
Help yourselves.

422
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,750
What's going on?

423
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,070
The situation has changed.

424
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,300
Can't you see?

425
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,560
Fei is being protective.

426
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,340
You'd better be careful.

427
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,780
Well...

428
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,790
shouldn't Fei be protective of us, too?

429
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,170
But Fei

430
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,110
used to...

431
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,590
A woman's mind is hard to understand.

432
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,810
What are you muttering about?

433
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,820
Hurry up and finish eating, then go practice.

434
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,630
Let's eat.

435
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,150
Let's eat.

436
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,470
Jin!

437
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,630
Where did you go?

438
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,520
If you don't want steamed stuffed buns,

439
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,390
let's go watch a puppet show!

440
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,370
Ms. Huang.

441
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,030
Mu.

442
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,590
Why are you here?

443
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,330
Have you seen Jin?

444
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,070
Mr. Jin?

445
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,340
No.

446
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
Alright. I'll keep looking.

447
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,770
Jin!

448
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,310
Jin!

449
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,670
Mr. Jin!

450
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,050
What's wrong with you?

451
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,300
You shouted so loudly.

452
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,980
Well, well,

453
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,420
you're in a leisurely mood.

454
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,100
You're playing hide-and-seek with Ms. Huang early in the morning.

455
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,480
You're so annoying.

456
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,410
Are you trying to tell Huang Ying where I am?

457
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,050
I've been helping you all along.

458
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:02,730
Yet you're

459
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,820
repaying my kindness with ingratitude?

460
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,020
You're usually carefree.

461
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,980
Why are you so bashful

462
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,410
when it comes to matters of relationships?

463
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,970
You're just the same, aren't you?

464
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,180
You're trying to make Su Ruofei forgive you

465
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,450
by becoming her music apprentice

466
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,780
and doing whatever you're told.

467
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,650
I'm doing these willingly.

468
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,770
However,

469
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,930
she still hasn't forgiven me.

470
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,670
You hurt her so badly before.

471
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,020
She won't believe you're sincere.

472
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,520
I've done all but cut my heart out and show it to her.

473
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,960
Am I not sincere enough?

474
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,000
You need to ask yourself.

475
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,600
Besides that misunderstanding between you two,

476
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,790
is there any other connection

477
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,250
she cares about very much?

478
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
A connection Ruofei cares about...

479
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,880
I see.

480
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,570
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

481
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,200
You truly are my lucky star.

482
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,360
No need to thank me.

483
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,950
Just treat Fei well.

484
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,340
Don't worry.

485
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,380
I'll definitely treat Ruofei well.

486
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,490
Also,

487
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,950
I'll do my best

488
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,840
to get you and Ms. Huang together.

489
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,470
W-What Ms. Huang?

490
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,660
She and I...

491
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,020
It was just an accident.

492
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,610
Accident?

493
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,170
What accident?

494
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,750
What happened between you two?

495
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,920
What happened?

496
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,520
I shouldn't have helped you.

497
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,570
Since you've already helped me,

498
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,380
why not help me all the way?

499
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,670
The Young Lord

500
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,710
is being despicable in broad daylight,

501
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,240
isn't he?

502
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,060
Young Lord?

503
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,880
What Young Lord?

504
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,640
There's just Mu here, who only thinks about pursuing his wife.

505
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,300
Are you going to help me or not?

506
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,700
What's your answer?

507
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,750
This is where you can find most of them.

508
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,500
There are plenty here, too.

509
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,760
And here.

510
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,230
Are you sure I can find them at all these places?

511
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,430
Sure. There are plenty at these places.

512
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,770
In that case,

513
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
I'll go to all these places to look for them.

514
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,300
According to what you said,

515
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,550
you need many of them.

516
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,530
I'm afraid you can't do it alone.

517
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,660
Why don't we split up and look for them?

518
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,090
That's not necessary.

519
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,500
I need to

520
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,250
do this by myself.

521
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,140
However, I need you

522
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,660
to help me persuade Ruofei

523
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,020
and do the preparations here.

524
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,310
Of course…

525
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,750
Sure.

526
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,150
the most important thing

527
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,150
is to keep it a secret from Ruofei.

528
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,700
Jin, I found you!

529
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,820
What are you doing here?

530
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,800
What's this?

531
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,280
Nothing.

532
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,990
Breakfast's ready.

533
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,520
You're up.

534
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,350
Good morning.

535
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,030
Good morning.

536
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,000
There are extra dishes today.

537
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,990
Eat more.

538
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,130
How many times have I told you?

539
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,570
Mind your manners.

540
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,900
You hit me on my old injury.

541
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,510
Did I?

542
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,830
Fei,

543
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,750
look,

544
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
my old injury is acting up.

545
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,000
Why don't we take today off

546
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,260
and skip practice?

547
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,300
Yeah, Fei.

548
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,530
Let's take today off.

549
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,430
Monkey's starting to smell.

550
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:39,930
That's right.

551
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,980
Fei, I...

552
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,630
Look.

553
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:42,990
Look.

554
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,110
Yes. He stinks.

555
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,960
Look.

556
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,870
All of you are acting weird

557
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,250
today.

558
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,570
What?

559
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,300
Are you trying to slack off?

560
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,340
The food's getting cold.

561
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,470
Let's eat first.

562
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:01,910
The food's getting cold.

563
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,870
Let's eat.

564
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,430
Let's eat.

565
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,710
-Come on. Eat.
-Here.

566
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,180
Ruofei.

567
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,270
Well, I think everyone

568
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,770
has been practicing hard.

569
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,280
The weather is nice today,

570
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,810
so they want to take a break.

571
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,680
I believe if they can balance practice and rest,

572
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,140
they'll have more inspiration when playing music.

573
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
What do you think?

574
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,870
-That makes sense.
-Jin is right.

575
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,070
Let these stinky men

576
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,670
find inspiration in the river.

577
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,910
I've been in Cloud City for so long,

578
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,100
but I haven't gone shopping yet.

579
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,960
Why don't you go shopping with me?

580
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,400
I remember

581
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,200
you once went shopping by yourself.

582
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,520
Shopping alone

583
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,610
is different from shopping with you.

584
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,700
I don't care.

585
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,210
You must go shopping with me today.

586
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,800
You must buy me whatever I want.

587
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,090
Here. There's enough money.

588
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,350
Buy whatever you want.

589
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,180
Who wants your money?

590
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,410
I do!

591
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,070
Let's go.

592
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,800
I'll take you shopping in the city.

593
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,330
I'll buy you whatever you want.

594
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,100
I haven't had breakfast.

595
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,870
What's so good about these dishes?

596
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,430
Let's go.

597
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,140
I'll take you to have a feast in the city.

598
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,260
Let's go.

599
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,690
Eat more.

600
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,150
Are you happy?

601
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,250
I didn't know you were a shopping enthusiast.

602
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,170
Are these heavy?

603
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:27,870
Let me help you.

604
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,800
No need.

605
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,670
All these years,

606
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,760
I've been chasing Jin around.

607
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,500
It's rare for me to go shopping.

608
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,040
Let's go.

609
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,210
Walk faster. We're almost there.

610
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,780
What are these?

611
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,170
Huang Ying.

612
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,770
Huang Ying?

613
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,980
You're here.

614
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,160
What trick are you playing?

615
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,520
Come with me.

616
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,820
It's for me?

617
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,240
What a tacky box!

618
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Watch carefully.

619
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,990
♫Looking out at the court, the moonlight casts a light shadow♫

620
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,270

00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,530
On this moonlit night with fireflies,

738
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,450
even a forthright woman like Fei

739
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,430
has turned tender.

740
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,790
Yun Mu gave up everything to come to Cloud City.

741
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,640
He even set aside his pride as the Young Lord

742
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,100
and did so much for Ruofei.

743
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,140
I truly admire him.

744
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,270
Now,

745
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,010
his efforts have paid off.

746
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,280
Yes.

747
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,510
I didn't expect the Young Lord

748
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,130
to be so love-struck.

749
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,200
He's not like

750
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,620
some unromantic men.

751
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,570
We've already kissed.

752
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,410
Where are you going?

753
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,800
I...

754
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,300
It's improper to watch this.

755
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,380
I'll give them some privacy.

756
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,140
Great.

757
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,070
It's time for us to talk about us.

758
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,660
Us?

759
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,030
I'll take my leave.

760
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,980
Wait for me.

761
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,260
They've already kissed.

762
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,150
Should we leave, too?

763
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,680
It will be bad if Fei discovers us.

764
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,560
You go first.

765
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
We'll keep watching.

766
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,790
Stop watching.

767
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,460
Let's go.

768
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,510
Let's go.

769
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,710
Let me keep watching.

770
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,680
-Let's go.
-I was enjoying it.

771
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
It's so wonderful

772
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,050
and beautiful!

773
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,380
Yes.

774
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,830
So wonderful

775
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,490
and beautiful.

776
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,570
We could release these fireflies,

777
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,660
but

778
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,820
I can never

779
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,270
and will never let you go again.

780
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,440
You mean you forced me to leave

781
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,090
to protect me?

782
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,020
When you were in danger,

783
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,600
you let me go

784
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,360
instead of having me fight together with you.

785
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,170
Since you don't trust me,

786
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,020
why did you get me back?

787
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,620
I can live quite freely and happily

788
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,070
on my own.

789
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,980

Master Jin.

838

The buns just came out of the steamer.

They're still hot.

Please be careful.
