[Cloud Pavilion]

4
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,090
See? I was right, wasn't I?

5
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,470
What do you think?

6
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,670
Shanshan still played the best, right?

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,440
Yes.

8
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,710
Bravo, bravo!

9
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,670
Amazing.

10
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,780
This piece is our latest work.

11
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,470
This was our first time performing it together,

12
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,550
so our performance lacked polish.

13
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,950
To play like this on the first try

14
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,550
is already very impressive.

15
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,090
It just proves that you are all very talented.

16
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,030
So, what do you think?

17
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,310
Isn't Shanshan and her group's performance

18
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,170
still the best?

19
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,430
Please wait a moment, Mayor.

20
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,530
Lord Liang and I need to discuss this further.

21
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,060
They played so well, what's there to discuss?

22
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,670
Mayor.

23
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,150
Minister Ling and Lord Liang

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,190
have their own considerations.

25
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,650
Why are you in such a hurry?

26
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,250
Alright, alright.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
Then hurry up and discuss it.

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,070
I still think

29
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,790
Su Ruofei's "Prelude to Yearning"

30
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,690
is better than Su Ruoshan's

31
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,610
"Thoughts of Jasper."

32
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,070
But Su Ruofei

33
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,050
was just involved in the instrument room fire incident.

34
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,780
How can we let her participate?

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,390
The ceremony is in a few days.

36
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,720
We can't afford delays.

37
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,900
Then let's go with Su Ruoshan.

38
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,740
After our discussion and evaluation,

39
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,900
for this ceremony,

40
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,710
the Shouyang Group led by Su Ruoshan

41
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,840
will be in charge of leading the music.

42
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,490
Bravo!

43
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,910
Su Ruoshan,

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,710
is there any problem with your leg?

45
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,870
Don't worry, Minister Ling.

46
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,470
I will not fail this mission.

47
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,370
Minister Ling!

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,990
Mayor, Minister Ling, Lord Liang.

49
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,710
What's the matter? Why so flustered?

50
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,870
The Young Lord and Master Jin

51
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,270
have asked all of us to gather at Huiyin Hall.

52
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,600
They say they've found evidence of arson.

53
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,130
Let's go now.

54
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,630
Young Lord,

55
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,230
I've already checked the management office's ledgers.

56
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,960
No one has taken extra lamp oil.

57
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,420
What clues did they find?

58
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,510
Master Jin and the others have discovered

59
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,350
that the arsonist

60
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,710
used the special lamp oil unique to our Symphony Workshop.

61
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,710
Right now, Minister Ling

62
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,640
is investigating who misappropriated the lamp oil.

63
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,710
Then besides the management office,

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,630
are there any other places

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,920
where this kind of lamp oil can be found?

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,550
This lamp oil is specially customized for our Symphony Workshop.

67
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,210
It can't be bought elsewhere.

68
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,880
Ruoshan,

69
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,500
did you

70
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,310
spill any lamp oil?

71
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,560
No, I didn't.

72
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,670
Why do you ask?

73
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,310
It's nothing.

74
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,710
Is it possible

75
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,190
that someone saved up lamp oil over time,

76
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,250
so they didn't need to withdraw more?

77
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,150
It's not impossible,

78
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,620
but how long

79
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,220
would it take to accumulate that much lamp oil?

80
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,240
Minister Ling, Young Lord,

81
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,990
I know who has extra lamp oil.

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,350
Then tell us,

83
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,030
who has it?

84
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,090
It's Su Ruofei.

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,750
Me?

86
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,440
What do I need lamp oil for?

87
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,360
You asked me to spare you some lamp oil before.

88
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,760
Wait a moment.

89
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,790
Thank you.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,480
Right.

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,140
She also asked me for some too.

92
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,850
I remember now.

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,380
I was getting it for my sister.

94
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,490
I spilled her lamp oil earlier.

95
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,440
That's why I asked you for some.

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,760
Musician Su.

97
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,470
Is what Su Ruofei said true?

98
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,750
Yes.

99
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,140
Fei borrowed the lamp oil for me.

100
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,380
Ruoshan.

101
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,830
That's not what you told me earlier.

102
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,430
Tang Xue.

103
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't talk anymore.

104
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,270
Ruoshan.

105
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,060
You must answer truthfully.

106
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,110
Did Ruofei really borrow the lamp oil for you?

107
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,150
Why all this fuss?

108
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,190
Want to know if Shanshan borrowed it?

109
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,120
Just check her room and we'll know.

110
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,990
Mayor.

111
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,400
Let's go.

112
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,630
Come.

113
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,560
All of Shanshan's lamp oil is here.

114
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,510
This proves that Su Ruofei lied.

115
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,580
How do you know this lamp oil

116
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,600
isn't the one Su Ruofei borrowed?

117
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,310
Because Ruoshan told me

118
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,220
that her lamp oil was never spilled.

119
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,390
After learning that Su Ruofei borrowed lamp oil,

120
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,850
she went along with the story about spilling it.

121
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,850
It was clearly to protect Su Ruofei.

122
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,270
Couldn't she be lying then?

123
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,510
Why would she lie?

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,100
Everyone knows

125
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,790
that Shanshan cares the most

126
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,150
about her younger sister.

127
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,010
If Su Ruofei really borrowed the lamp oil,

128
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,270
why didn't she admit it from the beginning?

129
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,150
Because she's the one who started the fire.

130
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,950
She wanted to frame Su Ruofei.

131
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,360
If she started the fire,

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,290
why is the lamp oil inside intact?

133
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,330
Moreover,

134
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,710
when the fire started,

135
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,430
Su Ruoshan was with Music Minister Ling.

136
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,560
Her leg is injured too.

137
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,310
How could she have had time to do that?

138
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,670
Right.

139
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,430
But she...

140
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,650
I think it's clear that Su Ruofei started the fire.

141
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,270
Not only did you start the fire,

142
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,760
but you also wanted to frame Shanshan.

143
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
You...

144
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,100
Mayor, isn't that a bit biased?

145
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,060
You said they are sisters.

146
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,310
An older sister wouldn't harm her younger sister,

147
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,170
so why would a younger sister harm her older sister?

148
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,960
That's right.

149
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,460
Why would I want to harm my sister?

150
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,680
Because you're afraid

151
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,850
she'll take your position as the ceremony musician.

152
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,310
That's why you framed her.

153
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,590
But I agreed to my sister taking the assessment.

154
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,240
That's exactly your clever move.

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,860
You agreed on the surface

156
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,930
but stabbed her in the back.

157
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,280
You thought no one would suspect you this way.

158
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,960
-You...
-Enough.

159
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,760
Stop talking.

160
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,690
Ruoshan.

161
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,280
Only you can prove Ruofei's innocence now.

162
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,990
Please answer truthfully.

163
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,340
Did Ruofei borrow the lamp oil for you?

164
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,450
Sister.

165
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,450
Fei.

166
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,880
Why did you do this?

167
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,930
Sister.

168
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,510
What are you talking about?

169
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,840
Why did you set the fire?

170
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:39,960
I...

171
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,040
Let's wait and see.

172
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,860
Sister.

173
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,940
Tell them quickly.

174
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,840
You clearly asked me to borrow the lamp oil.

175
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,910
You said you knocked over my oil pot.

176
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,310
But my oil pot

177
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,510
is perfectly fine.

178
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,010
You could have replaced it with a new one.

179
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,570
The oil pots in Symphony Workshop are all custom-made.

180
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,650
Each one has the owner's name on it.

181
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,680
[Shan]

182
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,510
Sister.

183
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,790
Why?

184
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,190
Fei.

185
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,760
You've caused too much trouble this time.

186
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,350
Even I can't protect you.

187
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,820
What are you waiting for?

188
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,290
Take Su Ruofei away.

189
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,930
Don't you dare!

190
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,720
Mu.

191
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,050
As the Young Lord of Dongsheng,

192
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,550
are you going to knowingly break the law

193
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,930
and harbor a criminal?

194
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,230
We can't be certain now

195
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,890
that Su Ruofei is the culprit.

196
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,360
And I believe

197
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,160
Ruofei would never set a fire.

198
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,690
Ruoshan.

199
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,790
Ruofei is your own sister.

200
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,340
Please answer truthfully.

201
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,670
Did she really borrow the lamp oil for you?

202
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,700
You only want to believe Fei's words.

203
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,950
Does that mean you're certain I'm lying?

204
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,440
Do you think I would harm my own sister?

205
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,630
Everything I said is true.

206
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,660
My lamp oil

207
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,480
has never been spilled.

208
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,660
Supervisory Inspector.

209
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,580
You're in charge of this case.

210
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,360
What do you think?

211
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,350
Why are you looking at him?

212
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,000
We have laws in Dongsheng.

213
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,280
Even royalty are subject to the same laws as commoners.

214
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,880
Speak.

215
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,180
Young Lord,

216
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,540
from what we can see now,

217
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,670
Su Ruofei is indeed the prime suspect.

218
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,310
I can only take her back to the Supervisory Office for now.

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,330
Go with them first.

220
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,920
I'll find a way.

221
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I don't want to go.

222
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,100
Don't you believe me?

223
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,430
Of course I believe you.

224
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,470
Give me some time.

225
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,010
I'll get to the bottom of this.

226
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,280
If anyone dares to harm Su Ruofei,

227
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,240
I won't let them off.

228
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,100
Take her away.

You can't take her away.

Master Jin,

234
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,860
please don't make this difficult for me.

235
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,120
It's clear someone is framing Su Ruofei.

236
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,790
I hope you will investigate thoroughly.

237
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,260
Even if I am to investigate,

238
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,670
we must return to the Supervisory Office to conduct a thorough investigation.

239
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,900
We can't stay at Symphony Workshop indefinitely.

240
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,660
Please rest assured, Master Jin.

241
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,940
If we can truly prove

242
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,430
that Ms. Su is not involved,

243
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,280
I will certainly clear her name.

244
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,820
No.

245
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,950
The conditions at the Supervisory Office are too harsh.

246
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,590
What's all this commotion about?

247
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,670
Inspector.

248
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,640
Arrest whoever

249
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,640
dares to interfere as well.

250
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,470
Yes.

251
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,890
If you want to rescue her,

252
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,640
I can help you hold them off.

253
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,310
Shangyu.

254
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,810
You should go back first.

255
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,710
I didn't do this.

256
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,310
No one can wrongly accuse me.

257
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,580
And I believe the Inspector

258
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,940
can prove my innocence.

259
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,720
I hope you will investigate thoroughly.

260
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,980
Thank you, Inspector.

261
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,510
Ms. Su, please.

262
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,840
If Ruofei is found guilty in the end,

263
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,060
I can help you break her out of jail.

264
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,800
Where are you going?

265
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,360
Whatever she says is right.

266
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,710
I was just joking,

267
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,170
and you gave me a long face.

268
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,290

Fei.

272
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,110
Why did you do this?

273
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,700
Why did you set the fire?

274
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,030
Fei.

275
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,380
You've caused too much trouble this time.

276
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,980
Even I can't protect you.

[Symphony Workshop Topographic Map]

279
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,750
Young Lord.

280
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,760
You should rest.

281
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,470
You haven't rested or eaten anything

282
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,590
for a whole day.

283
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,380
I'm fine.

284
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,150
How is she doing in jail?

285
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,710
Not bad.

286
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,190
The Inspector is treating her well.

287
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,360
Did the Supervisory Office

288
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,760
find any new evidence?

289
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,930
As far as we can see,

290
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,080
Su Ruofei is still the prime suspect.

291
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,630
It can't be Ruofei.

292
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,390
Then,

293
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,080
could Su Ruoshan be lying?

294
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,470
Even if she lied,

295
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
she didn't have time to set the fire.

296
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,360
Minister Ling can testify to that.

297
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,420
Or maybe she had other accomplices,

298
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,160
like the Mayor of Cloud City.

299
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,470
I've considered that,

300
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,470
but it's impossible.

301
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,670
Although my uncle is frivolous,

302
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
he handles matters with integrity.

303
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,910
He wouldn't harm a woman.

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,430
I still find it hard to believe

305
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,830
that Su Ruoshan would do this to her sister.

306
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,000
After all, she was so kind

307
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,700
even to a stranger.

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,660

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,700
Don't be too anxious.

310
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,010
The truth will come out eventually.

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,890
Tomorrow is the ceremony.

312
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,770
You should get some rest tonight,

313
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,500
so His Majesty and Madam won't worry.

314
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,410
I will definitely get you out of there.

315
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
I will.

has quite the charm you had back in the day.

320
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,270
This is the new musician

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,900
Mu picked up from Cloud City,

322
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,290
Su Ruoshan.

324
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,980
Not bad.

325
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,810
My Lord, do you mean that her music is not bad,

326
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,120
or that she is not bad?

327
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,790
Both.

328
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,370
My Lady.

329
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,640
Is there something you want to say?

330
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,850
My Lord, do you remember that

331
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,430
when Mu was young,

332
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,500
he once got lost in the Green Flash Forest

333
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,360
and was rescued by a jasper girl?

334
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,650
That jasper girl

335
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,220
is none other than Ms. Su here.

336
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,900
So they have such a fateful connection.

337
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,790
I believe that the incident

338
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,620
has already reached Madam Yaoshan's ears.

339
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,680
My Lord.

340
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,240
I've also heard that just a few days ago,

341
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,970
our precious son publicly kissed a girl surnamed Su

342
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,790
in Symphony Workshop.

343
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,260
He even told everyone

344
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,070
that this girl was his most beloved.

345
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,280
I guess

346
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,450
it must be this Su Ruoshan.

347
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,290
It seems Mu wants to settle down.

348
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,440
Good.

349
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,900
Very good.

350
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,300
Let's go.

351
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,310
Pay your respects.

352
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,300
May His Majesty and Her Majesty bless the world.

353
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,960
May the people of Dongsheng be blessed with peace and prosperity.

354
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,920
Dongsheng is blessed with stability and prosperity.

355
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,390
The kingdom is at peace.

356
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,830
It is all thanks to talents like you, my pillars of the state,

357
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,430
who have devoted yourselves wholeheartedly.

358
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,070
We will serve Dongsheng with utmost dedication,

359
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,830
until our dying breath.

360
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,790
Rise.

361
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,810
Mu,

362
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,830
you have been diligent in selecting musicians for this ceremony,

363
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,710
fulfilling your duties with utmost dedication.

364
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,310
Now that the ceremony has gone smoothly,

365
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,070
you should be credited with the greatest merit.

366
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,530
What reward do you desire?

367
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,920
Feel free to speak.

368
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,280
As the Young Lord,

369
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,250
I should naturally share my father's burdens

370
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,020
and set an example for all officials.

371
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,770
Selecting musicians for the ceremony

372
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,700
is also part of my duties.

373
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,220
For this ceremony,

374
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,390
all the musicians have demonstrated exquisite skills,

375
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,650
and they should be generously rewarded.

376
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,400
Ms. Su.

377
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,930
I, Su Ruoshan of the Symphony Workshop, pay my respect to Your Majesty.

378
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,210
Your leg...

379
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,260
It's just a minor injury,

380
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,300
nothing serious.

381
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,570
That Mu could bring you from Cloud City to Symphony City

382
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,180
is truly a blessing for our Dongsheng.

383
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,070
The position of music minister

384
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,800
now has a promising successor.

385
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,410
Your Majesty, you're too kind.

386
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,140
My skills are insignificant,

387
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,250
I dare not aspire to be the music minister.

388
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,980
There's no need to be so modest.

389
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,290
If your skills were truly insignificant,

390
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,540
how would the other musicians in the Symphony Workshop

391
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,250
feel about themselves?

392
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,830
Your Majesty's guidance is correct.

393
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,030
I will keep it in mind.

394
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,290
Very good.

395
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,610
This composure and elegance

396
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,420
reminds me of your demeanor in your younger days.

397
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,680
I heard from My Lady that

398
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,670
you and Mu have known each other for a long time,

399
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,560
and have mutual affection.

400
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,700
You truly are a perfect match.

401
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,350
It reminds me of

402
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,480
when I first met My Lady at the Symphony Workshop.

403
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,600
Since you two are fond of each other,

404
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,660
I'd like to act as a matchmaker for you

405
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,850
and create another beautiful story for our Symphony City.

406
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:14,270
Your Majesties, please perform the ceremony offering.

407
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,740
-Uncle.
-What trick are you playing?

408
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you like Su Ruofei?

409
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,110
Why did Brother betroth Shanshan to you?

410
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,840
I'm as shocked as you are about this.

411
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,650
There must be some misunderstanding.

412
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,790
I'm on my way to see Father now

413
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,940
to ask him to rescind the order.

414
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,020
Rescind the order?

415
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,030
Really?

416
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,100
Of course.

417
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,950
Then why didn't you say anything

418
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,700
at the ceremony earlier?

419
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,270
There were too many people and too much chatter.

420
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,670
If I had spoken up rashly,

421
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,660
it would have been disrespectful to Father

422
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,030
and undermined his authority.

423
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,700
Secondly,

424
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,390
it would have also embarrassed Boss Su.

425
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
That makes sense.

426
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,180
I was too hasty earlier.

427
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,150
Let's hurry and explain everything to Brother.

428
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,350
-Alright.
-Let's go.

429
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,250
[Cultivate With Music]

430
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,350
Have you heard?
[Cultivate With Music]

431
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,420
[Cultivate With Music]

432
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,990
Ms. Su not only
[Cultivate With Music]

433
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,020
[Cultivate With Music]

434
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,170
dazzled everyone at the ceremony,
[Cultivate With Music]

435
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:28,810
dazzled everyone at the ceremony,

436
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,400
but she was also betrothed by His Majesty on the spot.

437
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Who told you that?

438
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,640
Is the information reliable?

439
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,040
Of course it's reliable.

440
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,350
My father also attended the ceremony.

441
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,780
He just sent someone to remind me

442
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,570
not to offend Ms. Su.

443
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,750
She's been betrothed?

444
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,990
To whom?

445
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,640
To the mayor of Cloud City?

446
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,800
Of course not.

447
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,330
It's the Young Lord.

448
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,370
The Young Lord?

449
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,370
These two don't seem to have much interaction usually.

450
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,390
Why suddenly betroth them?

451
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,910
What's going on here?

452
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,980
Why would His Majesty arrange a marriage

453
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,420
between Yun Mu and Su Ruoshan?

454
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,740
Indeed.

455
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,540
Where are you going?

456
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,700
To find Yun Mu and get to the bottom of this.

457
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,460
What's the point of that?

458
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,720
If Yun Mu is really going to marry Su Ruoshan,

459
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,390
don't tell me

460
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,110
you still want to be with Su Ruofei.

461
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,130
Haven't you already let her go?

462
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,320
Why do you still care about her affairs?

463
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,280
If in this world,

464
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,770
feelings were so easy to let go of,

465
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,230
there wouldn't be so much

466
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,760
pain from unrequited love.

467
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,300
Unrequited love?

468
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,830
If we're talking about unrequited love,

469
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,610
how could you understand it better than me?

470
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,790
[Yongkang Palace]

471
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,510
Father,
[Yongkang Palace]

472
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:44,620
[Yongkang Palace]

473
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,720
I already have someone in my heart.

474
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
I hope you can rescind the betrothal order.

475
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,450
Already have someone?

476
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,120
But your mother clearly told me

477
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,860
that you and Su Ruoshan were in love with each other.

478
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,250
Sister-in-law must have made a mistake.

479
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,910
I'm the one in love with Su Ruoshan,

480
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,670
Brother.

481
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,800
What does this have to do with you?

482
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,480
It's a long story.

483
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,020
Back when we were in Cloud City,

484
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,950
Shanshan and I were already in love.

485
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,100
When we returned to Symphony City this time,

486
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,250
I was hoping you would betroth us.

487
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,180
I didn't expect that you

488
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,640
would betroth Shanshan to Mu instead.

489
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,340
But Mu doesn't even like Shanshan!

490
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,450
He's in love with Su Ruofei.

491
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,460
Stop, stop.

492
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,120
The more I hear, the more confused I get.

493
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Su Ruofei?

494
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,650
Why does that name sound familiar?

495
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,950
Reporting to Father.

496
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,170
Su Ruofei is a musician from the Symphony Workshop.

497
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,830
She is also...

498
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,800
I remember now.

499
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,320
Su Ruofei, who set fire to the instrument room.

500
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,090
Father, please understand.

501
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,670
It is not yet confirmed that

502
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,670
Su Ruofei is the culprit.

503
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,770
Impossible.

504
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,030
The Symphony Workshop represents Dongsheng.

505
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,540
It's a place of etiquette and musical regulations.

506
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,420
Su Ruofei is so audacious.

507
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,100
She dared to set fire to the instrument room.

508
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
That's trampling on Dongsheng's etiquette and laws.

509
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,650
You are the Young Lord of Dongsheng.

510
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,570
You absolutely cannot marry such a despicable woman.

511
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,670
Su Ruoshan is graceful and elegant.

512
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,780
She has a great chance of becoming the music minister in the future.

513
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,870
You and her are truly a match.

514
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,580
No way.

515
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,750
Shanshan is mine.

516
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,320
You can't promise her to anyone else.

517
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,220
How dare you!

518
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,640
Are you questioning my decision?

519
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,140
But this is a wrong decision!

520
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,430
What gives you the right to give the woman I love

521
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,230
to Mu?

522
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,180
Is it just because he's your son?

523
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:13,940
Yun Shang!

524
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,790
Brother!

525
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,520
Shut up!

526
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,270
I think you're not in your right mind now.

527
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,900
Calm down and then come talk to me.

528
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,030
Guards!

529
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,750
Father.

530
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,380
Escort the Mayor of Cloud City back to his mansion.

531
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,870
Yes.

532
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,360
Don't forget what you promised me.

533
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,440
Why are you still here? Leave!

534
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,840
Mayor, please.

535
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,240
Out of my way!

536
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,390
He's getting more and more out of line.

537
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,810
Father, please calm down.

538
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
You go back too.

539
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,240
Soon,

540
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,530
I will issue the official document for the arranged marriage.

541
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,650
Prepare to marry Su Ruoshan.

542
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,070
Father.

543
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,530
In my heart, there is only Su Ruofei.

544
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,270
Impossible.

545
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,030
I have ordered the Supervisory Office to severely punish Su Ruofei.

546
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,760
You should give up on this idea.

547
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,660
I'm tired.

548
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,420
-Father.
-Go back.

549
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,500
Father!

550
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Greetings, Your Majesty and Madam.

551
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,230
Has Mu gone back?

552
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,390
Not yet.

553
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,240
Madam.

554
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,830
The Young Lord has been kneeling in the side hall all night.

555
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,580
He hasn't had a drop of water.

556
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,710
Kneeling all night?

557
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,290
Why didn't you inform me earlier?

558
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,260
I forbade them to speak.

559
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,900
The night is cold.

560
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,420
Our son has been kneeling in the hall all night.

561
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,710
You're his father.

562
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,620
Don't you care about him?

563
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,110
Who says I don't care?

564
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Listen, Rong'er.

565
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,980
It was you who told me

566
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,820
that Mu and Ms. Su were in love with each other.

567
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,950
That's why I kindly wanted to arrange their marriage.

568
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,160
Now Mu has changed his mind,

569
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,030
and you're helping him blame me.

570
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,540
I've ended up being the bad guy either way.

571
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,150
I just overheard their casual conversation.

572
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,880
They said this lady was called Su Ruo-something.

573
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,910
I thought it was Ruoshan.

574
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,350
It's all my fault for not asking clearly.

575
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,490
Fortunately, you haven't officially issued the order yet.

576
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,150
There's still room for negotiation in this matter.

577
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,550
Why don't you have a good talk with Mu?

578
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,860
There's no need for father and son to be at odds

579
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,890
and create unnecessary discord.

580
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,320
He's the one creating discord with me.

581
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,520
Yesterday, he and his uncle Yun Shang

582
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,310
spoke rebelliously in the hall

583
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,270
for the sake of a woman.

584
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,950
They demanded that I retract my decree.

585
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,740
My word is golden.

586
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,300
Do I have no face to save?

587
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,150
You're right.

588
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,870
This is all Mu's fault.

589
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,290
It's also my fault for failing to teach him properly.

590
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,010
I'll go to the hall right away.

591
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,770
I'll kneel there with Mu

592
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,600
to reflect on our mistakes.

593
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,900
Are you trying to threaten me too?

594
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,160
I wouldn't dare.

595
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,500
However, this matter

596
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,770
is ultimately because I wrongly matched the couple.

597
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,980
It's not that I'm forcing Mu in this matter.

598
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,770
But the person he likes

599
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,540
is Su Ruofei, who burned down the instrument room.

600
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,460
How could I possibly let Mu marry her?

601
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,550
But the Supervisory Office

602
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,810
hasn't made a final decision yet, right?

603
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,880
Perhaps Su Ruofei isn't responsible for this.

604
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,070
Whether she did it or not,

605
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,820
there's still a stain on her reputation.

606
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,910
Mu absolutely cannot marry her.

607
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,450
But if you don't agree,

608
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,130
given Mu's personality, he will certainly...

609
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,760
This matter

610
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,690
can no longer be left to Mu's whims.

611
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,070
I'll have the Supervisory Office make a ruling right away

612
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,580
and expel her from Symphony City.

613
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,630
If Mu still insists on his own way,

614
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,970
she'll never be able to leave the Supervisory Office for the rest of her life.

615
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,000
He listens to you the most.

616
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,190
Go and try to persuade him again.

617
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,860
Be careful.

618
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,480
Slow down.

619
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,320
Careful.

620
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,670
-Here.
-Okay.

621
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,930
Sit down quickly.

622
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,220
Brew some ginger tea for the Young Lord.

623
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,900
Yes.

624
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,210
Mother.

625
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,630
What did Father say?

626
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,690
Are your knees alright?

627
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,320
Mother.

628
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,680
My knees are fine.

629
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,380
I'm sorry for worrying you.

630
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,210
You and your father have similar temperaments.

631
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,540
You're both so stubborn.

632
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,260
Indeed.

633
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,010
Thank goodness, you're here to mediate between us.

634
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,210
If you know it's hard for me, then be more obedient.

635
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,850
Don't always make me worry.

636
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,710
Mother.

637
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,470
Did Father have any message

638
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,960
for you to relay to me?

639
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,070
First, tell me

640
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,150
what you're thinking in your heart.

641
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,040
Mother.

642
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,790
I've always regarded Su Ruoshan as a good friend.

643
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,850
I've never had any ulterior motives.

644
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,600
The one who holds my heart

645
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,980
has always been Su Ruofei alone.

646
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,910
The music score you took last time.

647
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,550
Was it also for her?

648
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,460
Yes.

649
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,650
I believe that the girl you truly like

650
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,760
must be excellent.

651
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
But, Mu.

652
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,190
Your father has his own considerations.

653
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,910
Do you know why he wants to pick a new music minister?

654
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,730
I don't know, Mother.

655
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,750
Back in the day, when your father married me

656
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,210
at the Symphony Workshop,

657
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,820
the entire Dongsheng continent envied us.

658
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,710
We were a perfect match, in perfect harmony.

659
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,860
If you could also marry a music minister,

660
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,390
it would certainly boost your reputation.

661
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,400
You'd also gain the support of the people.

662
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,920
Your father's position

663
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,560
should have an heir by now.

664
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,680
Father's intentions are well-meaning,

665
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,240
and I am grateful.

666
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,430
But Mother,

667
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,470
love shouldn't be a transaction.

668
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,610
I only wish

669
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,060
to be like you and Father,

670
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,360
becoming a perfect match with my beloved

671
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,620
and live a loving life.

672
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,890
I hope you can understand and support this, Mother.

673
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,070
Your father respects me

674
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,850
and often seeks my opinion on many matters.

675
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,120
Similarly, there are some things

676
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,430
where I respect his decisions.

677
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,330
Mu,

678
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,540
your father has already issued an edict

679
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,650
to remove Su Ruofei from the Symphony Workshop

680
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,780
and expel her from Symphony City.

681
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:27,980
Mother,

682
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,730
I hope...

683
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,860
This is your father's final decision.

684
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,030
Mu,

685
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,330
you should say a proper goodbye to Ms. Su.

686
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,250
[Yongkang Palace]

687
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,100
Why are you only coming out now?

688
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,750
How did the arranged marriage matter go?

689
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,260
Uncle, have you been waiting all night?

690
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,150
What else?

691
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,560
Quickly, tell me how it went.

692
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,760
Did Brother agree to withdraw the marriage arrangement?

693
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,450
Didn't you say you would persuade him?

694
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,610
Or do you actually want to marry Shanshan?

695
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,090
The only one I want to marry is Ruofei.

696
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,130
If you don't believe me, Uncle,

697
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,730
you can ask Father yourself.

698
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,360
Let me tell you,

699
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,660
I will never hand Shanshan over to anyone else.

700
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,260
Ruoshan.

701
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,880
Ruoshan.

702
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,180
Young Lord.

703
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,000
Please, come in.

704
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,080
Ruoshan,

705
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,280
to be honest,

706
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,750
I came here today

707
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,350
to talk about the betrothal.

708
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,620
Please speak, Young Lord.

709
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,570
Regarding my father's betrothal,

710
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,150
it was truly a misunderstanding.

711
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,790
I've just spoken with my father

712
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,790
and asked him to withdraw the order.

713
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,940
Withdraw the order?

714
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,780
Yes.

715
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,450
News of the marriage between us

716
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,330
has spread throughout Symphony City.

717
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,900
You come to say this now,

718
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,220
where does this leave my reputation?

719
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,270
I know.

720
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,140
I was selfish in this matter.

721
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,200
But Ruoshan, you should know in your heart

722
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,870
that the one I love is Ruofei.

723
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,980
If I were to force you to marry me,

724
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,730
that would truly hurt you.

725
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,130
This situation will cause you some distress,

726
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,250
but don't worry,

727
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,760
I will make it up to you.

728
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,250
How do you plan to make it up to me?

729
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,410
You saved my life,

730
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,390
apart from this marriage arrangement,

731
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,450
I can fulfill any other wish you have.

732
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,760
Since you've said that,

733
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,770
allow me to be willful for once.

734
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,920
All these years, I've been thinking

735
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,610
about what it would be like to reunite with the jasper youth.

736
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,840
I hope you won't laugh at my greed.

737
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,770
Since our reunion,

738
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,580
what I've wanted

739
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,010
has always been your sincere heart.

740
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,350
But Ruoshan,

741
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,130
matters of the heart cannot be forced.

742
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,660
Then I can also tell you that

743
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,910
apart from the marriage,

744
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,180
I want nothing else.

745
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,070
I hope you can reconsider carefully.

746
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,770
I will come to see you again.

747
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,490
It's fine if we can't have it.

748
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,440
What we originally wanted

749
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,570
was just to use the identity of Young Lord's wife

750
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,640
to help us become the music minister.

751
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,030
As for whether Young Lord likes us or not, who cares?

752
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,710
As long as Madam and His Majesty don't change their minds,

753
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,850
the Young Lord has no way to disobey.

754
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,740
Now that Su Ruofei is also in prison,

755
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,230
our chain of schemes

756
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,580
can be said to be very successful.

757
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,990
Although telosma is rare,

758
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,830
it's not impossible to concoct.

759
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,130
In order to please Madam Yaoshan,

760
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,640
I specially learned how to concoct it.

761
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,980
It unexpectedly came in handy.

762
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,030
Shanshan.

763
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,420
Shanshan.

764
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,120
Come with me.

765
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,310
Mayor, where are you taking me?

766
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,670
Follow me to the palace

767
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,130
to ask my brother to cancel your engagement.

768
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,770
Mayor, you came here

769
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,540
just to have my engagement canceled?

770
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,340
Of course.

771
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,240
How could you marry Yun Mu?

772
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,260
The engagement was bestowed by His Majesty.

773
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,300
I have no say in it.

774
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,120
This engagement doesn't count.

775
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,840
Moreover, Mu has promised me

776
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,540
that he will definitely find a way to cancel the engagement.

777
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,150
Mayor,

778
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,550
I don't know

779
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,250
what exactly you said to Young Lord.

780
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,790
But as long as His Majesty hasn't given the order,

781
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,440
the engagement still stands.

782
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,300
Please, Mayor, conduct yourself with dignity.

783
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,710
What do you mean by this?

784
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,150
You can't really

785
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,950
want to marry that brat, can you?

786
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,580
There are many people watching.

787
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,410
Please, Mayor, mind your behavior.

788
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,510
If you have no other business,

789
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,010
I will go back now.

790
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,370
Shanshan!

791
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,390
Yun Mu!

792
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,060
Young Lord!

793
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,990
You've finally returned.

794
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,360
Mr. Jin has looked for you twice.

795
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,090
He just left.

796
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,580
Perhaps he should go see my father.

797
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,500
Maybe Father will spare Ruofei

798
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,150
for his sake.

799
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,200
Is His Majesty

800
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
refusing to cancel the engagement?

801
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,790
Not only does he refuse,

802
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,660
but he also wants to remove Ruofei from the Symphony Workshop

803
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,520
and expel her from Symphony City.

804
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,620
She's suspected of setting fire to the instrument room.

805
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,580
Father said she must be severely punished.

806
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,670
But the instrument room

807
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,000
clearly wasn't burned by Ms. Su.

808
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
Of course I know that.

809
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,810
But how can I prove it?

810
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,030
I'm now more certain than ever

811
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,370
that Su Ruoshan has been lying all along.

812
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,480
But I don't have any evidence.

813
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,350
And I can't figure out

814
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,380
why she would do this.

815
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,100
Xiaoqi.

816
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,340
All these years,

817
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,150
I always thought I could control everything.

818
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,110
But only now do I realize

819
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,730
that I can't even protect

820
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,020
the person I love most.

821
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,580
I'm really useless.

822
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,180
Young Lord, please don't say that.

823
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,670
You should plead with His Majesty again.

824
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,140
You can ask Mr. Jin to go with you.

825
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,250
There must be a way.

826
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,250
I need to think it over.

827
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,610
Young Lord.

828
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,000
[Zhaoxi Villa]

829
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,220
Mayor, I'm here at your urgent summon.

830
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,350
What are your orders?

831
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,180
Huang Fu.

832
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,670
How many death squads do you have left?

833
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,820
I still have five teams of men.

834
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,020
Send them all to assassinate Yun Mu.

835
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,700
May I ask why?

836
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,390
Don't ask so many questions.

837
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,850
Go and arrange it quickly.

838
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,080
Is this because of the engagement?

839
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,520
That's right.

840
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,110
Brother clearly knows I like Shanshan,

841
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,500
yet he's forcing Shanshan to marry Yun Mu.

842
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,590
Brother is just favoring his own son.

843
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,510
It seems the position of royal advisor

844
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,040
will also be given to Yun Mu.

845
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,750
Mu.

846
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,210
I must eliminate him.

847
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,220
Mayor, have you considered the fact that

848
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,940
all previous assassination attempts have failed?

849
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,400
Yun Mu is already on guard.

850
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,810
If we act rashly this time,

851
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,090
we may fail again

852
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,480
and even risk exposing our identities.

853
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,380
I can almost confirm

854
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,540
that Yun Mu is deaf.

855
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,880
If you give me more time...

856
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,230
So what if he's deaf?

857
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,960
I want him dead now!

858
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,410
You have five teams of people.

859
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,710
Can't all of you combined kill one person?

860
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,710
If you can't kill him,

861
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,640
don't come back!

862
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,720
Mayor.

863
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,830
Please listen to me.

864
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,150
What's wrong with you?

865
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,070
Before, when I didn't want you to kill him,

866
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,240
you insisted on killing him.

867
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,590
Now that I'm telling you to kill him,

868
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,340
you're making all sorts of excuses.

869
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,860
If you can't do it,

870
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,210
I'll kill him myself!

871
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,520
I accept the order.

872
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,370
Go quickly.

873
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,180
Mu.

874
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,040
Before, out of consideration for our kinship,

875
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,850
I had some compassion for you.

876
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,470
Now that you're trying to take my Shanshan away,

877
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,200
I can no longer spare you.
