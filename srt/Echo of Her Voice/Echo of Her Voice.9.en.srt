[Echo of Her Voice]

2
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,420
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,860
Young Lord.

4
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,950
I'm sure you

5
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,700
still remember this piece.

6
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,020
The "Green Flash Song" composed by Madam Yaoshan?

7
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,890
I can't believe my sister is playing this piece.

8
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,160
But if it were me,

9
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,290
I would play it too.

10
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,310
This is my favorite piece after all.

11
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,400
What song are you hearing

12
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,750
that is getting you this excited?

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,620
It's my sister who is playing the "Green Flash Song".

14
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,950
The "Green Flash Song"?

15
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,830
I wonder if anyone

16
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,290
will be able to respond to my sister's piece.

17
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,470
Who would respond?

18
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,720
Who would dare to respond?

19
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,700
Who is he? Why is he grabbing it?

20
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,840
The harp is not easy to play.

21
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,710
Indeed.

22
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,140
I'll go take a look.

23
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,990
It's the Mayor!

24
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,270
Uncle?

25
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,670
All of my careful planning

26
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,300
has been ruined by this fool.

27
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,540
Why is the Mayor playing the harp

28
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,070
like he is plucking cotton?

29
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,290
I can't believe Uncle would be

30
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,020
this infatuated with Ruoshan.

31
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,750
He even learned to play the harp for her.

32
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,740
Shanshan!

33
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,010
Shanshan!

34
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,430
Did you hear me play?

35
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,190
Come out, please.

36
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,740
Shanshan!

37
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,170
Greetings, Mayor.

38
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,710
I'm sorry, Mayor.

39
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,520
According to the rules of the musical gathering,

40
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,260
male and female musicians are not allowed to

41
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,600
meet face to face during the musical exchange.

42
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,790
I can get a maid to return the harp for you.

43
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,440
No need, I'll go myself.

44
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,290
Mayor, please don't put us in a difficult position.

45
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,820
Just take it away then.

46
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,470
Return the harp.

47
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,750
You don't seem very excited.

48
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,520
How is this person's playing?

49
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,090
It's alright, I guess.

50
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,200
Just alright?

51
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,670
How does it compare

52
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,990
to your playing?

53
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,210
Well...

54
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,800
I think I'm a bit better.

55
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,600
You're better?

56
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,110
Who gave you such confidence?

57
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,440
Of course, it's from...

58
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,710
The brilliant and mighty

59
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,000
Young Lord, who excels in both appearance and skill.

60
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,070
By being under your tutelage every day,

61
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,150
I've been gradually influenced.

62
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,890
My skin...

63
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,470
has grown rather thick.

64
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,910
Well, if that's the case,

65
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,380
why don't you go up and perform too?

66
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,680
I've come all the way to this music gathering

67
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,440
and have only heard your wrist bells so far.

68
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,170
I have yet to hear a single, proper piece of music.

69
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,850
That's not a good idea.

70
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,100
I came here to only be your ears.

71
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,290
What's wrong?

72
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,770
Are you afraid?

73
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,070
Are you afraid that after you play,

74
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,070
no one will come and pair up with you?

75
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,140
But don't worry.

76
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,190
If there really is no one,

77
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,140
I'll step in to save you from embarrassment.

78
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't afford to

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,330
disgrace our Young Lord's Mansion, can I?

80
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,920
No need.

81
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,660
Don't worry.

82
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,190
After I'm done playing,

83
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,850
everyone will sure be rushing to pair up with me.

84
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,410
What's wrong now?

85
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,880
Wait a minute.

86
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,750
I didn't bring any instruments.

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,190
I'll have someone borrow one for you.

88
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,070
No need, I have an idea.

89
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,440
Sister.

90
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,520
Can I borrow your harp?

91
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,750
Fei, why are you here?

92
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,140
Is Young Lord...

93
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,440
Young Lord wants to hear me play a tune,

94
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,550
but I didn't bring any instruments.

95
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,190
I recalled you have a harp.

96
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,560
Can I borrow it for a while?

97
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Young Lord wants to pair up with you?

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,790
That's not the case.

99
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,870
He just wants to see that no one wants

100
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,910
to pair up with me after I play,

101
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,910
so that he can make fun of me later on.

102
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,950
Please welcome the next musician.

103
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,030
It's my turn.

104
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,850
Sister.

105
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,290
Please help me.

106
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,840
Alright, alright.

107
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,670
She's actually chose to play this piece.

108
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,930
I didn't expect her to hold such a grudge.

109
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,560
This person's skills on the harp

110
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,720
is far inferior

111
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,280
when compared to Shanshan.

112
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,620
This piece...

113
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,080
Let me respond to you, shall we?

114
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,860
Sister.

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,350
Thank you.

116
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,750
I haven't played the harp in a long time.

117
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,660
It feels so good.

118
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,590
Miss,

119
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,020
please place the harp on the flower boat.

120
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,110
Is that necessary?

121
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,880
I was just playing for fun.

122
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,390
The rules of the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering state that

123
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,070
once you've played,

124
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,230
you must allow others to respond.

125
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,290
Please cooperate.

126
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,420
Alright.

127
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,990
I didn't think she could play that well.

128
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,170
I told you so.

129
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,150
No one will want to pair up with you.

130
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,640
There can't really be no one, right?

131
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,830
That little devil will surely mock me.

132
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,810
Master Jin has stood up.

133
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,410
What a good brother

134
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,920
for coming to my rescue at a critical moment.

135
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,160
Master Jin! Master Jin!

136
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,830
It's Master Jin. Let's go!

137
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,830
Come on, let's go see!

138
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,030
Hurry, let's go!

139
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,750
Go for it, Master Jin!

140
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,210
Come on, Master Jin!

141
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,470
Young Lord has come too.

142
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,910
Young Lord is coming too.

143
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,140
Little devil?

144
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,610
He's not really planning to come to my rescue, is he?

145
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,910
Look!

146
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,270
It's Young Lord and Master Jin!

147
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,530
Both Young Lord and Master Jin have come.

148
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,780
Yes, look.

149
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,640
You actually stepped forward.

150
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,330
I knew you had ill intentions towards Ruofei.

151
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,960
You actually came out too.

152
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,520
I knew you had ill intentions towards my person.

153
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,770
This is interesting.

154
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,740
I didn't expect Su Ruofei to be this popular.

155
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,650
She actually attracted Jin Shangyu and Mu

156
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,160
to want to pair up with her.

157
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,000
It seems that Young Lord

158
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,920
really cares for Su Ruofei.

159
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,270
Was that you playing the harp just now?

160
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,960
You look so ordinary.

161
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,080
How did you manage to seduce Master Jin and Young Lord

162
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,540
to want to pair up with you?

163
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,070
They're willing to pair up with me

164
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,740
because I play well.

165
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,670
If you're jealous,

166
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,030
maybe you should reflect on

167
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,390
why was your performance so mediocre?

168
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,950
You!

169
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,510
Look, look!

170
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,850
The harp is coming. Let's see who gets it.

171
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,430
Fei!

172
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,390
Mu!

173
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,890
Watch out for the railing!

174
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,710
The Young Lord fell in too!

175
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,180
They've all fallen!

176
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,600
Quick, go check on them!

177
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,070
Come on, let's go!

178
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,720
They're coming out!

179
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,940
-Quick!
-How are they?

180
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,620
Fei!

181
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,020
Come.

182
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,250
Hurry!

183
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,310
Fei, are you alright?

184
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm fine.

185
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,530
I was just warning you about the railing,

186
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,880
and then you got hit by it immediately.

187
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,300
What's wrong with you?

188
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,990
I was trying to protect Su Ruofei at that time,

189
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,930
so I didn't hear you.

190
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,840
Don't worry.

191
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,830
Put me down.

192
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,190
I'll take you back.

193
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,640
I'm fine.

194
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,300
Don't move.

195
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,270
Are they alright?

196
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,450
Are you hurt?

197
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,830
Shangyu.

198
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,120
Put me down.

199
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,300
They'll misunderstand.

200
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,900
They didn't misunderstand.

201
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,040
Put me down.

202
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,170
Ruofei.

203
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,380
I'm not afraid of them misunderstanding.

204
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,760
I've always wanted to tell you that

205
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,320
I...

206
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,690
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

207
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh no.

208
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,320
What's wrong?

209
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,380
How could I have

210
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,550
almost forgotten about being his ears?

211
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,430
There are so many people around.

212
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,190
The little devil might not be able to handle it.

213
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,790
Ruofei.

214
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,280
What's going on?

215
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,510
Thank you, Shangyu.

216
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,940
I need to go back and find Yun Mu now.

217
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,300
You're going back to find Yun Mu?

218
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,680
I don't feel comfortable

219
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,600
with him on his own.

220
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,710
I'll go first.

221
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,530
Ruofei!

222
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,750
You care about him so much.

223
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,490
Could it be that you like him?

224
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,700
Um...

225
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,470
Everyone!

226
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,120
I'm fine.

227
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,180
There's no need to worry.

228
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,150
Have you ever thought about

229
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,630
how you, as the Young Lord,

230
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,830
jumping into the water for an entertainer,

231
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,120
would reflect on you?

232
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,310
What a disgrace!

233
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,720
Uncle, just hear yourself.

234
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,030
A beauty has fallen into the water.

235
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,160
How could I not help?

236
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't worry.

237
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,250
It's nothing.

238
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,970
I'm back. Are you alright?

239
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,340
What are you looking at?

240
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,860
Didn't you leave with Mr. Jin?

241
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,090
Why did you come back?

242
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,160
Fei!

243
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,390
Why did you come back?

244
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,670
The lady is feeling unwell.

245
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,070
I'll take my leave first.

246
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,710
Uncle, goodbye.

247
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,840
Let's go.

248
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,640
Look at Mu.

249
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,680
He'll fall into her romantic trap sooner or later.

250
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,470
How could there be a man like Young Lord?

251
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,040
He combines beauty, dominance,

252
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,900
and tenderness all in one person.

253
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,180
How much good has Su Ruofei done in her past life

254
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,570
to become Young Lord's new favorite?

255
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,260
Tell me,

256
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
does everyone like this sort of man?

257
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
"The lady is feeling unwell."

258
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,450
"I'll take my leave first."

259
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,500
I don't get it.

260
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,310
Shanshan.

261
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,520
Shanshan?

262
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,230
What's wrong?

263
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,710
It's nothing.

264
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,780
I'm just worried about Fei.

265
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,140
There's nothing to worry about.

266
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,950
Look at how anxious Mu was.

267
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,310
He's even willing to jump into the water for her.

268
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,420
He's treating your sister

269
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,110
with utmost love and care.

270
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,080
Everyone's watching.

271
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,340
I ask that you be careful with your words.

272
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,710
I misspoke.

273
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,890
Thank you for sending me back, Mayor.

274
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,470
You'd better leave now.

275
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,210
[Cloud Pavilion]
You'd better leave now.

276
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,960
[Cloud Pavilion]

277
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,910
Shanshan.
[Cloud Pavilion]

278
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,220
[Cloud Pavilion]

279
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,670
My tongued slipped at the musical gathering earlier.
[Cloud Pavilion]

280
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,330
Please don't be angry with me.
[Cloud Pavilion]

281
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:42,930
[Cloud Pavilion]

282
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,940
I am not blaming you, Mayor.

283
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,040
It's just that this concerns...

284
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,120
Ruofei's reputation, that's all.

285
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,160
Right.

286
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,790
I'll be more careful with my words in the future.

287
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,720
It's just that at the musical gathering earlier...

288
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,430
why didn't you pair up with me?

289
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,660
You are the lord of this city

290
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,990
and hold a noble status,

291
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,870
while I'm just a small musician.

292
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,430
Our statuses are worlds apart.

293
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,150
If I had responded to your playing,

294
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,150
I'm not afraid of others saying I'm trying to climb the social ladder.

295
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm just afraid that

296
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,860
others might say you're having an affair with a small musician,

297
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,110
which will tarnish your reputation.

298
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,710
I'd like to see who dares call you a small musician.

299
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,040
My dearest Shanshan

300
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,320
is the perfect candidate for the music minister position.

301
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,380
But hearing you say this puts me at ease.

302
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,420
[Cloud Pavilion]
But hearing you say this puts me at ease.

303
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,710
[Cloud Pavilion]

304
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,550
Otherwise, I would have thought
[Cloud Pavilion]

305
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,470
it's because my playing was lousy,
[Cloud Pavilion]

306
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,330
and you didn't respond to me for fear of being embarrassed.
[Cloud Pavilion]

307
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,630
and you didn't respond to me for fear of being embarrassed.

308
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,630
How could that be?

309
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,670
I'm already deeply moved by the fact that

310
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,550
you're willing to learn the harp for me.

311
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,570
Moreover,

312
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,910
you are usually busy with military affairs.

313
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,670
Yet today, you chose to play.

314
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,360
Even though I didn't respond to your playing,

315
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,020
everyone would think that you

316
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,430
must have found my music pleasing to the ear,

317
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,670
and was just casually responding.

318
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,270
That's still an anecdote worth talking about.

319
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,650
That's true.

320
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,310
You can blame me for being too serious.

321
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,810
I think maybe in the future,

322
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,080
I should learn to be more like Mu.

323
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,070
Be more casual.

324
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,670
What do you think?

325
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,080
I think you are fine as you are now.

326
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,140
Really?

327
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,740
You... you think I'm fine the way I am?

328
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,220
You are a man of valour

329
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,220
with an unyielding spirit.

330
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,480
It's truly admirable.

331
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:18,940
Great.

332
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,730
Then I won't change myself.

333
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,560
Please go back, Mayor.

334
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,910
I am feeling a bit tired.

335
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,980
Alright.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
You should head back in and rest then.

337
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,420
I'll come visit you another day.

338
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:29,700
Okay.

339
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,030
[Cloud Pavilion]
Okay.

340
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,260
[Cloud Pavilion]

341
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,190
Young Lord's attitude towards me remains unclear.

342
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,990
I can't afford to lose the Mayor's support for now.

343
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,860
How did you fall over at that time?

344
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,790
Do you remember?

345
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,230
I just remember

346
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,990
you and Shangyu both came in response

347
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,990
and suddenly a lot of people came forward.

348
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,490
We were all crowding around that railing,

349
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,430
and then I fell over.

350
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,720
So you're saying

351
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,290
it was really because of the broken railing,

352
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,750
and it was just an accident?

353
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,750
No.

354
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,020
Someone was trying to hurt me.

355
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,580
Someone wanted to hurt you?

356
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,930
Who wanted to hurt you?

357
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,090
You.

358
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,680
Me?

359
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,140
If you hadn't come out to respond,

360
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,440
would there have been so many people?

361
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,350
If there weren't so many people,

362
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,500
would I have fallen over?

363
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,720
How could this be my fault?

364
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,980
Jin Shangyu was also there at the time...

365
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,070
This is indeed my fault.

366
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,820
It's my fault for being more attractive than Jin Shangyu,

367
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,680
hence attracting so many people.

368
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,190
Moreover, the fact that I,

369
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,390
as the Young Lord, was willing to come out and pair up with you,

370
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,590
is your honor.

371
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,350
Young Lord,

372
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,230
can't you not be so narcissistic for just

373
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,250
one brief moment?

374
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,680
Of course not.

375
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,030
What's wrong with you?

376
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,630
I'm fine.

377
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,870
Let me see.

378
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,320
What?

379
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,560
Are you going to strip me in public?

380
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,510
How could you still be joking

381
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,970
at a time like this?

382
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,290
You got hurt because

384
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,720
you're trying to save me.

385
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,310
It's nothing.

386
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,900
Just a superficial wound.

387
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,100
Don't worry about it.

388
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,550
[Zhaoxi Villa]

389
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:34,610
This is the current situation in Cloud City.
[Zhaoxi Villa]

390
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,230
This is the current situation in Cloud City.

391
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,150
But don't worry,

392
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,420
I've made all the necessary arrangements.

393
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,220
You may leave.

394
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,790
Mayor,

395
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,390
don't you think Young Lord is acting a bit strange?

396
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,900
What's strange about him?

397
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,350
Today at the musical gathering,

398
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,950
you cautioned him about the railing,

399
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,340
but he didn't hear it.

400
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,900
Don't you think that's rather strange?

401
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,220
What's strange about this?

402
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,790
Didn't he already explain?

403
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,110
He was distracted as he was thinking about Su Ruofei at that time,

404
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,110
so he didn't hear.

405
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,860
I don't think it's that simple.

406
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Remember when we were in the outskirts of Cloud City,

407
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,830
you had also called out to him,

408
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,880
but he said he had just woken up,

409
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,130
so he didn't hear you.

410
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,540
I think these two incidents

411
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,530
must be related.

412
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,150
What would the relevance be?

413
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,930
Is he deaf or something?

414
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,110
Mayor.

415
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
That's not impossible.

416
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,220
Nonsense.

417
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,620
I think you're just being overly suspicious.

418
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,870
You are

419
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,730
consistently suspicious of him.

420
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,460
Show me some real evidence instead.

421
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,240
From Cloud City to Symphony City,

422
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,570
what have you found out?

423
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,480
You keep saying he wants to compete with me for power,

424
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,230
but what does he have to challenge me with?

425
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,760
His mansion full of beautiful entertainers?

426
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,370
Mayor.

427
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,140
Why don't you give me some time?

428
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,870
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

429
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,730
How about that?

430
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,150
You just won't give up, will you?

431
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,740
Fine. Go ahead and investigate.

432
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,820
But, don't you dare to act rashly again,

433
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,960
and you must not hurt him.

434
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,640
Yes.

435
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you, Mayor.

436
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
You may leave now.

437
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,150
So, Young Lord, you disregarded your own safety

438
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,980
just to protect Su Ruofei?

439
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,190
The situation was urgent at the time.

440
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,390
I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

441
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,140
Indeed, you couldn't.

442
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,140
Young Lord.

443
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,330
What is it now?

444
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,590
It's true that you couldn't ignore someone in danger,

445
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,790
but today you almost paired up with her.

446
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,650
You know,

447
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,100
the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering

448
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,780
is all about expressing one's feelings through music.

449
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,440
Young Lord,

450
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,080
don't you think the way you treat Su Ruofei

451
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,750
is a bit exceptional?

452
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,710
I treat her specially

453
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,430
because she's my little ears.

454
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,880
Just look at your portrait.

455
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,410
What are you talking about?

456
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,740
This portrait!

457
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,400
This is a portrait of Su Ruofei.

458
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,280
What do you think? Does it look like her?

459
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,610
They say a painting reflects one's heart.

460
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
If you don't have feelings for her,

461
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,750
why did you draw her?

462
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,330
I drew her because...

463
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,780
I drew her because...

464
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,910
Could it be...

465
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,150
Could it be that I really do have feelings for her?

466
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,980
In fact, I've had my suspicions for some time.

467
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,450
I always thought you simply valued her highly,

468
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,910
that's why you liked her this much.

469
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,060
But now it seems...

470
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,380
you've actually fallen for her.

471
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,490
I like her?

472
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,390
Impossible.

473
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,270
How could I possibly like her?

474
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,930
Even if...

475
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,230
Even if I actually like her,

476
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,860
it will only work out if she likes me back.

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,600
Come here.

478
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,530
Come here.

479
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,040
Do you think

480
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,650
she likes me?

481
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,630
Well...

482
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,610
I think she does like you.

483
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,700
But... she's a girl after all,

484
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,250
so she might be shy.

485
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,540
Besides, you're the Young Lord,

486
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,490
so she'd be even more hesitant to show it.

487
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,990
Xiaoqi.

488
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,370
You've finally said something right.

489
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,310
Indeed, if she likes me,

490
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,220
it might result in a lot of pressure on her.

491
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,440
She wouldn't dare to tell me directly.

492
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,730
I can understand that.

493
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,850
Young Lord.

494
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,630
What do you plan to do?

495
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,660
If you want to pursue her...

496
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,780
I've read some novels previously,

497
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,740
and there are some strategies we could pick up.

498
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,270
We could try those.

499
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,130
Who said I was going to pursue her?

500
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,860
I have made a mistake.

501
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,050
I misunderstood you, Young Lord.

502
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,080
I'll go reflect on my mistake right away.

503
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,720
Come back.

504
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,070
You mentioned some novels just now.

505
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,570
What strategies are in those novels?

506
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
Hurry up and bring them to me.

507
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,290
This mind of mine!

508
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,530
No, wait.

509
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,660
Why should I be reading such novels?

510
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,920
It's not like I'm going to confess first.

511
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,630
Yun Mu, oh Yun Mu.

512
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,000
How could you fall for her first?

513
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,970
This won't do.

514
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,240
Even if I have to confess,

515
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,970
I have to get you to confess to me first.

516
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,090
Why is he all I can think about?

517
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,780
Why is my heart is beating so fast?

518
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,790
It can't be...

519
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,750
I couldn't have fallen for him, could I?

520
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,200
No way.

521
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,300
This is simply too unlucky.

522
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,790
How could I possibly like

523
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,390
this little devil?

524
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,710
Calm down, calm down.

525
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,990
Why is he all I can think about?

526
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,670
Go away, go away, go away!

527
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,190
Why is it all about him?

528
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,150
This is my bedroom, you know.

529
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,200
And you're telling me to go away?

530
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,840
Well...

531
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,110
I didn't tell you to go away.

532
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,740
I was...

533
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,590
I was swatting mosquitoes.

534
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,350
There are mosquitoes in this bedroom?

535
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,780
Where did they go?

536
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,470
Should I ask Haitang

537
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,820
to bring you some mosquito repellent incense?

538
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,540
No need.

539
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,270
You should go back and rest.

540
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,530
I'm going to sleep now.

541
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,470
Alright.

542
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,600
Alright.

543
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,430
What's wrong?

544
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,270
Is that medicine you're holding there?

545
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,850
Yes, it is.

546
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,930
If you don't mind,

547
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,390
let me help you apply it.

548
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,470
I don't mind.

549
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,230
Are you sure this is how you want to apply the medicine on me?

550
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,770
This is the best way.

551
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,030
Otherwise,

552
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,990
you might say I'm coveting your beauty in the future.

553
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,520
Give it to me.

554
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,900
Alright.

555
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,210
Where should I apply it?

556
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,560
Move your hand forward.

557
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,080
Here?

558
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,220
I'm sorry.

559
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,710
I didn't mean to.

560
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,250
Maybe you should apply it yourself.

561
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,910
Don't move.

562
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,930
Give me your hand.

563
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,810
Go ahead and apply it.

564
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,200
Does it hurt?

565
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,720

566
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,300
No, it doesn't hurt.

567

568

572

Why is my heart beating so fast?

580
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,300
That little devil must have cast a spell on me.

581
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,370
Or...

582
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,380
this is what it means to like someone?

583
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,850
If I had warned her at that moment,

584
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,710
Fei wouldn't have fallen over.

585
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,750
But I hesitated.

586
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,250
I hesitated.

587
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,970
You did nothing wrong.

588
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,910
You saw it too.

589
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,810
Today, in front of everyone,

590
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,090
Yun Mu wanted to pair up with Su Ruofei.

591
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,500
He then personally jumped in to save her.

592
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,130
Yun Mu has feelings for her.

593
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,460
If you continue to be soft-hearted,

594
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,040
Yun Mu will fall for her completely.

595
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,560
Don't you like Yun Mu too?

596
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,020
Are you really going to

597
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,510
give him up to Su Ruofei?

598
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,560
Like?

599
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,620
I won't fall for any man.

600
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,640
To me, they are

601
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,440
nothing but stepping stones.

602
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,520
I originally thought

603
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,630
Yun Mu would be like Yun Shang,

604
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,310
and help me become the music minister.

605
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,130
I've also considered that if Fei stood in my way,

606
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,930
I wouldn't hesitate to act.

607
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,390
But all of this happened a bit too quickly.

608
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,490
-I haven't even...
-You're feeling guilty?

609
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,750
You're regretting it?

610
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,390
That's right.

611
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,570
She's the true first young miss of the Su family.

612
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,730
She's also the true jasper girl.

613
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,080
Then why don't you give up your current identity,

614
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,140
give up the jasper,

615
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,410
give up your prestigious position as Cloud City's musician,

616
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,740
and your dream of becoming the music minister?

617
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,480
How about returning to your original life?

618
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,140
No!

619
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,290
I mustn't give up.

620
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,630

Remember,

623
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,430

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,200
Aren't you afraid that I might be a jinx?

734
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,580
Didn't I get you settled already?

735
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,570
Why are you still following me?

736
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,260
I'm not following you.

737
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,580
This road is so big and wide.

738
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,070
Can't I walk on it?

739
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,020
Alright.

740
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,850
You want to eat?

741
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,960
I don't have money.

742
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,040
Two steamed buns please.

743
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,120
Here.

744
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,710
Eat up.

745
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,230
Eat slowly.

746
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,690
Aren't you going to eat?

747
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,720
Why aren't you eating?

748
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,580
It smells good.

749
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,050
I'm afraid of getting fat.

750
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,180
You go ahead and eat.

751
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,960
I'll...

752
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,390
just eat this.

753
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,540
Thank you.

754
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,190
Oh, right.

755
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,250
My name is Huang Ying.

756
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,180
I still don't know your name.

757
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,470
Jin Shangyu.

758
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,780
Then I'll call you Jin.

759
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,240
Whatever.

760
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,150
Jin.

761
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,280
Jin.

762
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,970
Jin.

763
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,540
It's thundering again.

764
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,870
I'm scared.

765
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,770
Can I hold your hand?

766
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,280
Just this once.

767
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,520
I knew it.

768
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,060
No matter when,

769
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,130
you'll never abandon me.

770
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,710
I feel

771
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,670
the same way about you.
