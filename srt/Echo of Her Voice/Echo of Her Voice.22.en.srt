[Echo of Her Voice]

2
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,480
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,360
I can't believe Su Ruofei

4
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,430
has actually won favor with Madam Yaoshan

5
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,230
and received the invitation to the Jiuru Banquet.

6
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,450
There are so many

7
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,240
excellent musicians in the city.

8
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
Why is she the one favored by Madam Yaoshan?

9
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,510
It must be because of the Young Lord…

10
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,960
Instead of wasting time gossiping,

11
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,440
you should focus on improving your musical skills.

12
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,150
Don't embarrass the Symphony Workshop

13
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,610
at the Jiuru Banquet.

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,240
-Yes.
-Yes.

15
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,000
Alright.

16
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,730
Let's call it a day.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
You may leave now.

18
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,930
Fei,

19
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm surprised that you're also invited

20
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,700
to the Jiuru Banquet.

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,330
Looks like there can be no peace

22
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,080
between us.

23
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,160
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,330
The other day, I lost my mind and offended you.

25
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,170
As long as the mayor of Cloud City is on your side,

26
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,750
you always have a higher status than people like me.

27
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,670
The Xu family

28
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,630
has always been loyal to the mayor.

29
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,100
I came here today

30
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,010
to tell you something.

31
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,180
The Green Flash Workshop received the invitation,

32
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,180
but you don't need to worry about it.

33
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,230
Su Ruofei's hand is injured.

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,140
Maybe she can't attend

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,060
the Jiuru Banquet.

36
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,780
Injured?

37
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,430
Recently, she's been performing all over the city with her band,

38
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,960
drawing a lot of attention.

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,610
Do you really expect me to believe

40
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,440
such a baseless rumor?

41
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,580
I swear on my family's honor.

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,290
Imperial Physician Zhang, a renowned expert on external injuries,

43
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,140
was changing my bandages at my house

44
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,000
when he was suddenly called away.

45
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,270
He didn't even stay for the banquet that my father held to thank him.

46
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,800
I personally walked him out

47
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,330
and learned that from him.

48
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,230
I have an idea.

49
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,990
You know what?

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,430
It's really amazing.

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,440
It doesn't hurt anymore.

52
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,320
Of course.

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,420
Didn't I tell you

54
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,080
I'm an expert on acupressure?

55
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,660
That should do it.

56
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,270
Thank you.

57
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,550
No need to be so polite.

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,710
You must be thirsty.

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,700
Let me get you some water.

60
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,410
Wait.

61
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,670
Thank you a lot

62
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,630
for doing acupressure for me these days.

63
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,750
This cup of tea is for you…

64
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:26,830
It's fine.

65
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,580
Did you burn yourself?

66
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,220
No.

67
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,590
Be careful.

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,990
My hand.

69
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,110
Xiaoqi!

70
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,250
Go get Imperial Physician Zhang!

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,210
What's wrong with her hand?

72
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,720
Your Highness,

73
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,980
I've only performed acupuncture for three days.

74
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Patients have different constitutions.

75
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,760
Relapses are normal.

76
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,750
I'll prescribe a pain-relieving decoction

77
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,280
for Ms. Su right away.

78
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,150
I won't do acupuncture today

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,650
and will reassess the situation tomorrow.

80
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,790
Imperial Physician Zhang,

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,030
you're one of the best physicians

82
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,470
in the Imperial Hospital.

83
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,930
I shouldn't question you.

84
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,890
But Ruofei's hand

85
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,190
seems to be even worse

86
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,850
than when it was just injured.

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,540
Your Highness, calm down.

88
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,930
Let me go to the Imperial Hospital first

89
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,670
to get some pain-relieving medicine for Ms. Su,

90
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,800
and then prepare a better treatment plan.

91
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,830
Xiaoqi.

92
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,630
Yes.

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,860
Go to the Imperial Hospital

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,010
and invite all the on-duty imperial physicians to Jin's Mansion

95
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,230
for a consultation on Ruofei's condition.

96
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,780
Yes.

97
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,010
Ruofei.

98
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Let me do acupressure for you again.

99
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,450
Relax.

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,630
You finally came.

101
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,800
What's it?

102
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,480
Spill.

103
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,840
I may have been exposed.

104
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,610
You promised to protect me.

105
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,730
Get me out of the city now!

106
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,860
Don't be so jumpy.

107
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,980
If you ran away now,

108
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,060
wouldn't it be as good as admitting guilt?

109
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,820
Don't worry.

110
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,430
As long as you keep silent,

111
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,890
we'll ensure your safety.

112
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,400
Once they find out what I did,

113
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,620
can you really protect me?

114
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,480
If you hadn't forced me back then,

115
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,130
how would I end up like this now?

116
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,490
Watch your words!

117
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,150
Doing acupuncture wrongly or prescribing the wrong medicine

118
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,480
only means punishment.

119
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,730
At worst, you'd just lose your position as an imperial physician.

120
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,290
But if you say the wrong thing and drag us down,

121
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,970
you'll lose your life.

122
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,280
Think it through.

123
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,120
You…

124
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,670
You…

125
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,700
Forget it. I can't rely on them.

126
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,770
I gotta leave.

127
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,800
Who are you?

128
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,470
I caught you, didn't I?

129
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,370
Move!

130
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,810
Your Highness, Ms. Su,

131
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,010
please wait a moment.

132
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,430
Don't worry.

133
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,450
You'll be fine.

134
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,360
Imperial Physician Zhao,

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
how is Ruofei's hand?

136
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,170
Your Highness,

137
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,970
Ms. Su's hand was treated with acupuncture to dredge meridians

138
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,870
and acupressure to improve blood circulation.

139
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,130
It should have healed after about a week.

140
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,740
However, the wrong acupoints were punctured,

141
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,870
causing disorder in the meridians.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,350
Wrong acupoints?

143
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,790
You're the best physicians in Dongsheng.

144
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,120
Is there a solution?

145
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,660
Rest assured, Your Highness.

146
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,350
With daily acupuncture to correct the meridians,

147
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,750
Ms. Su's hand can heal.

148
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,430
But a complete recovery will take some time.

149
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,270
How soon can my hand fully heal at the earliest?

150
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,250
Starting tomorrow,

151
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll perform acupuncture on you daily

152
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,540
and give you medicine.

153
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,390
To fully heal,

154
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,530
it'll take about two to three months.

155
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,200
Two to three months?

156
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,870
What about the Jiuru Banquet?

157
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,090
I need to perform.

158
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,890
There's no solution to that now.

159
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,040
If you perform now,

160
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,990
it'll only worsen your condition.

161
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,460
Think twice, Ms. Su.

162
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,370
Ruofei.

163
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,710
We'll have plenty of chances to perform in the palace in the future.

164
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,070
The most important thing now

165
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,560
is to heal your hand.

166
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,220
You need to follow the physicians' instructions

167
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,750
and focus on the treatment.

168
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,330
Then we'll go prepare the medicine for Ms. Su.

169
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,100
Thank you.

170
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,230
Ruofei.

171
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,680
Fortunately, we discovered it in time.

172
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,950
The imperial physician said

173
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,240
your hand will fully heal, didn't he?

174
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,700
It'll just take some time.

175
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,600
But it'll take two or three months.

176
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,700
How's it possible

177
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,870
that the acupuncture was wrongly performed?

178
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,260
Could there be something wrong with that imperial physician?

179
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,660
The imperial physician?

180
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,990
Xiaoqi.

181
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,680
Yes.

182
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,840
Bring that man to me.

183
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,500
I'll interrogate him myself.

184
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,070
No need for that!

185
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,490
Huang Ying?

186
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,300
You're finally back.

187
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,550
You left without a word.

188
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,410
Do you still consider us friends?

189
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,500

This man

colluded with others

193
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,430
and deliberately punctured the wrong acupoints,

194
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,690
causing Ruofei's hand injury to worsen.

195
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,330

199
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,090
I didn't mean to do it.

200
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,140
Xu Hao?

201
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,230
Why did he do this?

202
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,420
I don't know.

203
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,650
I only know there's someone powerful behind him.

204
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,840
Yeah.

205
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,200
The one behind him

206
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,740
caught evidence of me secretly selling herbs

207
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,090
and had Xu Hao force me to do this.

208
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,420
Now, I suspect

209
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,190
that they deliberately tricked me into doing illegal sales

210
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,920
so they could use it against me.

211
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,250

who is the one behind Xu Hao?

216
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,260
I don't know.

217
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,360
I really don't know.

218
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,660
Who else could it be?

219
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,130
The person who wants to ruin Ruofei's hand the most

220
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,380
can only be Su Ruoshan.

-I didn't mean it.

You can't ignore Ruofei either, right?

Is there a way to cure Su Ruofei's hand?

291
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,970
The Young Lord asked Imperial Physician Zhao to treat her.

292
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,240
It can be cured,

293
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,780
but to fully recover,

294
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,420

Yes.

314
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,970
Huang Fu was the first to notice it.

315
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,670
He told me about it,

316
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,510
but I didn't take it seriously.

317
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,850
This time in Cloud City, I confirmed it myself.

318
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,550
He's indeed deaf.

319
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,810
How's that possible?

320
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,980
He talks to people like a normal man

321
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,150
and can even give advice on music.

322
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,610
Think about it.

323
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,620
Has he ever talked to you

324
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,800
with his back to you?

325
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,920
Has he ever talked to you without looking at you?

326
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,490
Then how do you explain that he can understand music?

327
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,340
I think someone has been helping him.

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,300

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,410
given his personality,

338
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,870
he'll likely keep it a secret.

That's the perfect opportunity to reveal it.

341

By then, even if my brother wanted to protect him,

342
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,030

376
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,040
but after your acupressure,

377
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,540
the pain has indeed lessened.

378
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,180
Good.

379
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,550
The imperial physicians said

380
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,590
you're recovering

381
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,120
better than they expected.

382
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,430
You'll definitely fully recover in less than two months.

383
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,210
Your Highness.

384
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:08,430
Lord Liang has sent an invitation.

385
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,690
[Invitation]
Lord Liang has sent an invitation.

386
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:09,790
[Invitation]

387
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,130
Several mayors jointly requested him
[Invitation]

388
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,330
Several mayors jointly requested him

389
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,370
to invite you to the Moonlight Tower tomorrow at noon

390
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,430
so they can pay their respects.

391
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,740
Those mayors have been in Symphony City for days.

392
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,400
Why are they inviting you now?

393
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,710
The Jiuru Banquet is in a few days.

394
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,380
They're asking to see me now

395
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,520
probably to sound me out.

396
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,360
Xiaoqi.

397
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,430
Tell them I appreciate their gesture,

398
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:36,590
but find an excuse

399
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,350
[Invitation]
but find an excuse

401
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,090
to decline the invitation.
[Invitation]

402
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,910
to decline the invitation.

403
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,550
Yes.

404
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,160
I can't believe it!

405
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,020
How can anyone believe such an absurd rumor?

406
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,790
Exactly.

407
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,420
How could the Young Lord possibly be deaf?

408
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,350
What are you talking about?

409
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,420
[Fish Swimming and Emerging to Listen]

410
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,880
Who told you that?
[Fish Swimming and Emerging to Listen]

411
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,050
Who told you that?

412
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,460
We went to buy groceries.

413
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,040
Everyone is saying that the Young Lord is deaf.

414
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,220
Fei, don't be angry.

415
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,040
How could it possibly be true?

416
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,660
Yeah.

417
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,790
Your Highness,

418
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,200
they say y-you're deaf.

419
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,110
If you were deaf,

420
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,670
I'd eat t-this basket.

421
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,420
Fei.

422
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,280
The rumor is true?

423
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,020
Besides Su Ruofei and me,

424
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,480
only Master Jin

425
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,480
knows that secret.

426
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,090
I'm warning you. Don't make assumptions!

427
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,320
What are you smiling about?

428
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,660
Don't flatter yourself.

429
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,940
I just can't stand him

430
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,110
suspecting people so casually.

431
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,760
Before I find out the truth,

432
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,330
I suspect everyone.

433
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,870
Enough, Xiaoqi.

434
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,140
Don't panic.

435
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,950
I told Shangyu about it

436
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,120
because he's trustworthy.

437
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,680
The one who could let that secret out now

438
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,860
can only be my dear uncle.

439
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,130
Last time in the Green Flash Forest,

440
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,510
he didn't kill me.

441
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,240
It must be because he had other plans.

442
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,420
How did he find out about your secret?

443
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,680
After that assassination, he's been lying low.

444
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,390
Perhaps he had known it then.

445
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,240
It seems that this banquet is a trap.

446
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,170
[Invitation]
It seems that this banquet is a trap.

447
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,390
It seems that this banquet is a trap.

448
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,520
His Majesty will appoint the royal advisor at the Jiuru Banquet.

449
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,420
Those who support you and Yun Shang are evenly matched.

450
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,810
[Invitation]

451
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,380
The mayors who have a wait-and-see attitude
[Invitation]

452
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,270
The mayors who have a wait-and-see attitude

453
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,890
are naturally eager to find out the truth

454
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,250
so they can choose sides accordingly.

455
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,070
Well, I wonder how come

456
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,310
your uncle has become so clever lately.

457
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,350
He's so insidious.

458
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,880
As an opponent, Yun Shang

459
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,710
has never been easy to deal with.

460
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,620
Then you must not go.

461
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,260
[Moonlight Tower]

462
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,830
Why hasn't the Young Lord come?
[Moonlight Tower]

463
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,990
Why hasn't the Young Lord come?

464
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,070
Could it be that the rumor is true

465
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,970
and he doesn't dare to show up?

466
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,230
The Young Lord is here.

467
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,480
Guys, sorry

468
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,910
for keeping you waiting.

469
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

470
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,730
No need for formalities, mayors.

471
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,660
Take your seats.

472
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,730
Sit here, Ruofei.

473
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,220
Your Highness, I heard you've been busy with performances,

474
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,230
working day and night.

475
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,550
How is your health?

476
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,760
Thank you for your concern, Lord Liang.

477
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm in good health.

478
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
It's just that lately, there are a lot of things

479
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,900
that I've been fretting over.

480
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,760
May I ask what's troubling you, Your Highness?

481
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,490
We're willing to help you.

482
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,190
A tree that stands out in the forest

483
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,850
will be destroyed by the wind.

484
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,670
A man who stands above others

485
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,200
will be criticized by many.

486
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,480
Your Highness, what do you mean?

487
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,240
I heard that people in the city

488
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,550
are all saying I'm deaf.

489
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,710
I wonder if any of you have heard about that.

490
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,170
No,

491
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,190
I haven't.

492
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,300
That's total nonsense.

493
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,190
You can converse with us without a problem.

494
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,120
How's it possible that you're dea…

495
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,100
You have hearing impairment?

496
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,080
If I find out who started that rumor,

497
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,960
I'll make sure they rot in jail!

498
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,630
I've heard that the Green Flash Workshop

499
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,090
will also participate in the Jiuru Banquet.

500
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,870
Your Highness, will you be performing too?

501
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,220
Mayor Danyang, why are you wearing a veil?

502
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,840
Can't you show your face in public?

503
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

504
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,210
I have a cold.

505
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,240
and don't want to give it to you,

506
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,230
so I'm wearing a veil.

507
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,040
I see.

508
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,060
I hope you get better soon.

509
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,900
I've joined the Green Flash Workshop,

510
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,830
so naturally, I'll be performing.

511
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,920
Besides, as a filial son,

512
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm very glad

513
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,640
to perform for my mother.

514
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,150
However, Ruofei

515
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,350
is the soul of our Green Flash Workshop.

516
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,330
I'll just be there to complement her.

517
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,630
Alright.

518
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,480
Stop talking to the Young Lord.

519
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,630
I've brought an entertainer from my house

520
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,390
to perform for the Young Lord.

521
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,510
Your Highness, I've long heard of your musical prowess.

522
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,180
I'm so delighted to have the honor

523
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,290
of playing for you.

524
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,520
You flatter me, miss.

525
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,820
Then please entertain us with your playing.

526
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,920
It'll surely liven things up.

527
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,050
Then I'll play for you.

528
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,780
Your Highness,

529
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,880
I want to eat tangerines.

530
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,390
Let me peel one for you.

531
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,420
Hurry up.

532
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,740
Is it sweet?

533
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,330
You should try it too.

534
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:51,830
Okay.

535
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,150
What do you think, Your Highness?

536
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,530
Do you like her playing?

537
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,950
Miss Miao not only looks beautiful

538
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,640
but also plays beautifully.

539
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,220
However,

540
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,780
at the beginning of the tenth measure,

541
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,370
she played a few notes incorrectly.

542
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,130
But this small mistake doesn't detract from the overall beauty.

543
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,350
She played "Wild Geese Alighting on a Sandy Beach"

544
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,110
with such grace and tunefulness.

545
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,190
It was truly pleasing to the ear.

546
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,350
Thank you for your comment, Your Highness.

547
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,210
Your Highness, you're so good at music

548
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,860
that even such a subtle mistake

549
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,530
didn't go undetected.

550
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,810
What's wrong, Ruofei?

551
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,590
I feel a bit tired.

552
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,390
I want to go back and rest.

553
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,440
As you wish.

554
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,430
Come.

555
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,750
Well then, mayors,

556
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,880
my girl is not feeling very well.

557
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,770
I'll take my leave first.

558
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,480
Why are you suddenly feeling unwell?

559
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,780
Come. This way.

560
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,350
Now that all your doubts

561
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,550
have been dispelled,

562
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,920
let's have dinner.

563
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,990
Your Majesty.

564
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,310
What have you found out?

565
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,330
At the banquet today,

566
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,430
the Young Lord talked fluently with the mayors

567
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,960
and even pointed out the mistake in the entertainer's playing.

568
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,090
The rumor about his hearing impairment should be false.

569
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,830
I knew it.

570
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,960
That rumor is total nonsense.

571
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,230
I watched Mu grow up.

572
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,480
I'd know

573
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,530
if he had a hearing problem.

574
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,290
I wonder who was so bold

575
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,990
to spread such a rumor.

576
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,050
But the Young Lord has proven himself.

577
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,120
I believe the rumor will stop soon.

578
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,510
I'm about to appoint the royal advisor,

579
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,610
and a rumor started at this time.

580
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,630
I'm afraid someone doesn't want Mu

581
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,230
to become the royal advisor.

582
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,720
Conduct a secret investigation.

583
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,980
Whoever is behind this

584
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,020
must be punished.

585
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,990
That's what happened.

586
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,500
I see.

587
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,540
Thank you, Mayor Danyang.

588
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,240
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

589
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,910
Jin.

590
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,870
Walk Mayor Danyang out.

591
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,440
Yes.

592
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,940
Mayor Danyang,

593
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,570
please.

594
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,640
Could I have misjudged?

595
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,480
He's not deaf at all?

596
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,630
Mayor.

597
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,350
Jin.

598
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,790
What do you think?

599
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,490
I still think Yun Mu can read lips.

600
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,870
But Mayor Danyang covered her mouth today.

601
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,400
How could he still hear her?

602
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,830
Yeah.

603
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,950
Well…

604
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,670
There must be something I don't know.

605
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,330
By the way,

606
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,870
who else attended the banquet with Yun Mu today?

607
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,830
Xiaoqi

608
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,770
and Su Ruofei.

609
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,870
It should be Xiaoqi.

610
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,150
Mayor, think about it.

611
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,630
Xiaoqi has always been

612
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,010
by Yun Mu's side since childhood.

613
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
He's probably been his ears for a long time.

614
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,640
From what we can see now,

615
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,540
he's the most suspicious.

616
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,170
In that case,

617
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,280
we'll proceed with the original plan.

618
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,770
Kill Xiaoqi before the Jiuru Banquet.

619
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,810
Yes.

620
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,370
My girl is not feeling very well.

621
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,800
I'll take my leave first.

622
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,150
Goodbye, Uncle.

623
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,870
Su Ruofei?

624
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,360
You're such a sweet talker.

625
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,580
No wonder Mu takes you

626
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,940
wherever he goes.

627
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,680
It's Su Ruofei?

628
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,200
Jin.

629
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,130
On that day, at all costs,

630
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,340
you must find a way

631
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,870
to trap Su Ruofei.

632
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,030
Don't let her stay with Yun Mu.

633
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,760
Understand?

634
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,260
But Mayor,

635
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,970
isn't it Xiaoqi?

636
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,160
We were all wrong.

637
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,710
The one passing messages to Yun Mu isn't Xiaoqi

638
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,800
but Su Ruofei.

639
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,670
On every important occasion,

640
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,100
the one closest to Yun Mu is Su Ruofei.

641
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,080
I used to think

642
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,680
it was because Yun Mu was lechery.

643
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,160
But now that I think about it,

644
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,360
he's found himself a pair of ears.

645
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,320
But with everyone watching,

646
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,470
how can she pass messages to him?

647
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,970
I can't figure that out either.

648
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,360
But I'm certain

649
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,790
that Su Ruofei is the key.

650
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,800
On that day, you must trap Su Ruofei.

651
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,620
But don't take her life.

652
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,860
After all, she's Shanshan's sister.

653
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,330
Understood.

654
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,380
Should I kidnap her tonight

655
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,310
just to be safe?

656
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,990
Foolish!

657
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,390
Taking action tonight

658
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,050
would alert them.

659
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,830
I need to catch him off guard,

660
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,690
giving him no time to find a solution.

661
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,890
Yes.

662
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,610
You're so wise, Mayor.

663
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,960
Go make preparations.

664
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,400
Yes.

665
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,630
Yun Mu.

666
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,560
I've finally found your weakness.

667
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,490
Let's see how you can escape this time.

668
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,880
[Jin's Mansion]

669
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,810
Done.

670
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,510
What's wrong?

671
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,010
I'm a bit worried.

672
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,390
Do you think Yun Shang and Su Ruoshan

673
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,070
will cause us trouble again?

674
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,070
When we attended the banquet the other day,

675
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,670
did we really fool everyone?

676
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,380
His Majesty will appoint the royal advisor today.

677
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,510
Yun Shang will definitely make a move.

678
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,450
But don't worry.

679
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,300
No matter what his plan is,

680
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,340
I won't let him harm you.

681
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,000
Today is so important for you.

682
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,860
I won't let anyone get in your way.

683
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,750
You look so beautiful!

684
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,480
Beautiful!

685
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,990
Thank you, everyone.

686
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,990
Without you,

687
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,470
I wouldn't have had the chance

688
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,270
to perform at the Jiuru Banquet.

689
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,900
You guys have helped me fulfill my dream.

690
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,870
Thank you.

691
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,180
Fei, n-no need to thank us.

692
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,460
Your dream

693
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,940
is also our dream.

694
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,710
Yeah.

695
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,190
If you want to thank us,

696
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,400
wait until we win.

697
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,460
Okay.

698
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,910
Years of hard work for this moment!

699
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,620
Come on.

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,280
please play "Triumph" together,

748
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,070
praying for Dongsheng's eternal peace.

749
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,630
The Symphony Workshop shall start first.

750
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,270
Let's see how you can change your fate today.

751
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,700
It's time for me to seek justice

752
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,140
for Biao

753
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,750
and for myself.

754
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,790
[Prosperity]

755
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,950
It's played so poetically.

756
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,900
"Triumph"

757
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,910
was composed by Madam Yaoshan

758
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,970
to celebrate His Majesty's unification of Dongsheng.

759
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,790
It's the best piece

760
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,860
for our final showdown.

761
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,810
It'll also be the song of my triumph.

762
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,690
Su Ruofei.

763
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,550
You're destined to be defeated by me,

764
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,340
while I'll rise to the top

765
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,000
in the spotlight.

766
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,460
You composed this song when I was fighting

767
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,510
on the battlefield.

768
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,750
You're as valiant as ever.

769
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,500
This song has two parts.

770
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,410
Ms. Su is playing the first part.

771
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,750
It's majestic

772
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,180
and awe-inspiring.

773
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,270
It reminds me

774
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,030
of the eager and fervent anticipation

775
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,960
of the soldiers' triumphant return when I composed it.

776
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,170
Excellent!

777
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,070
[Prosperity]

778
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,950
She…

779
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,790
Unable to beat the drum with your hands,

780
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,920
are you going to play with ankle bells?

781
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,740
What a cheap trick.

782
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,230
They're playing quite well, aren't they?

783
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,310
Great! Great!

784
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,400
[Prosperity]

785
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,960
Excellent!

786
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,510
"Triumph" has always been played

787
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,090
as the fight song of Dongsheng.

788
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,070
Everyone believes

789
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:08,690
it's a song praising my invincibility

790
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,310
and conquests.

791
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,550
But few know that the second part of this song

792
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,120
was the lullaby hummed by border soldiers

793
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,950
when they missed their families

794
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,800
and also a requiem for the brave warriors

795
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,100
who died on the battlefield.

796
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,580
Love

797
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,080
is what motivates the soldiers to protect their country and people.

798
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,940
Whether victorious or defeated,

799
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,800
war is a sorrow for all people.

800
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,800
As the monarch,

801
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,940
my only wish is for the country to prosper and the people to live in peace,

802
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,620
and for there to be long-lasting peace.

803
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:47,670
[Prosperity]
and for there to be long-lasting peace.

804
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,710
[Prosperity]

805
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,150
Your Majesty is benevolent.
[Prosperity]

806
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,600
It's a blessing for all people.
[Prosperity]

807
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:51,880
It's a blessing for all people.

808
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,540
May Dongsheng be prosperous and peaceful.

809
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,540
May there be no more wars in the world.

810
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,990
[Prosperity]

811
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,230
May Dongsheng be prosperous and peaceful!

812
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,950
May there be no more wars in the world!

813
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,760
[Prosperity]
