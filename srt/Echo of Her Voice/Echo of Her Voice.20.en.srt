4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,230
How do you feel?

5
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,550
Did you sleep well last night?

6
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,410
Where are Huang Ying and Shangyu?

7
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,320
They…

8
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,510
You did a lot yesterday.

9
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,790
Look at them.

10
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,480
Eat this.

11
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,950
You can't eat this alone.

12
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,290
You need something to go with it.

13
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,450
Let me help you.

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,680
You eat the dish.

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,550
-I eat the bun.
-I eat the bun.

16
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,470
-We'll never be apart.
-Never apart.

17

You eat the dish.

18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,470
I eat the bun.

19
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,970
We'll never be apart.

20
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,800
Just eat your breakfast.

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,870
Don't copy me.

22
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,740
I want to eat that too.

23
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,470
Here.

24
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,440
Try this one then.

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,950
If things go on like this,

27
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,590
will you abandon the three of us one day?

28
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,270
How's that possible?

29
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,870
We at the Green Flash Workshop will never be apart.

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,310
Eat up.

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,750
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

Who's there?

34

Calm down.

35
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,400
It's me.

Greetings.

37
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,530
How's it going?

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,550
We've been taking shifts patrolling around the forest.

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,590
There's nothing unusual.

40
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,900
Now that the sun is up,

41
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,150
I don't think anyone will come.

42
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,610
Don't let your guard down.

43
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,790
Maybe they didn't come at night because they plan

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,630
to catch us unawares in the morning.

45
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,030
I'll go check over there.

46
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,120

Yes.

No.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,830
Someone touched the hidden bells we set up.

50

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,270
Tell our men to retreat.

Retreat?

126
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,340
I deliberately shot a whistling arrow just now,

127
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,670
but he didn't notice it.

If it weren't for Xiaoqi and Su Ruofei,

129
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,750
he would've already died.

130
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,020
So Huang Fu was right.

131
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,790
Mu is indeed deaf.

132
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,110
We failed this time,

133
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,400
but I have another way to deal with him.

135
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,310

This may hurt a bit.

145
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,250
I'll remove the arrow for you.

146
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,680
Hang in there.

147

Don't scare me, Ruofei.

156
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,300
Don't scare me.

157

Ruofei,

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,830
please don't leave me alone.

159

Ruofei.

160
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,000
Do you remember?

161
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,270
This is where

162
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,190
we met for the first time.

163
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,030
You'll be fine.

164
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,550
Ruofei.

165
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,680
Wake up, Ruofei.

Ruofei.

169

Ruofei, you won't die.

170
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,180
Look.

171
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,930
The green flash has appeared.

172

174
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,630

175
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,620
I'm begging you.

176
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,660
Please save Ruofei,

177
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,190
as you saved me back then.

178
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,790

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,400
Don't leave me.

Okay.

235
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,430
Slowly.

236
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,720
Careful.

237
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,310
How's your wound?

238
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,570
Do you feel any better?

239
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,260
I don't know if it's because of the green flash

240
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,920
or the bleeding-stop powder,

241
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,610
but I feel much better now.

242
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,000
Good.

243
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,200
Your wounds…

244
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,950
Let me walk by myself later.

245
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,720
I wonder how they are.

246
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,830
I hope they're all okay.

247
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,880
They'll be fine for sure.

248
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,830
Poor Biao.

249
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,360
Yeah, poor Biao.

250
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,030
Those assassins were all sent by Yun Shang?

251
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,190
Did he do it to just get rid of you

252
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,250
so he could become the royal advisor?

253
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,090
It was the reason before,

254
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,100
but now, your sister is also part of the reason.

255
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,380
My sister?

256
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,640
What does Su Ruoshan have to do with this?

257
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,420
My uncle believes

258
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,560
I want to take Su Ruoshan from him.

259
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,300
I've told him

260
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,600
you're the only one in my heart,

261
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,440
but he just doesn't believe it.

262
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,720
Later,

263
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,430
after the death of Huang Fu, who watched him grow up,

264
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,760
he became even more determined to kill me.

265
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,070
Let's go back.

266
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,120
Okay.

267
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,780
Come.

268
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,230
Careful.

269
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,080
I'm fine.

270
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:07,990
Let's go.

271
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,430
Okay.

272
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,020

273
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,000
Biao lost his parents at a young age.

Biao lost his parents at a young age.

275

We're his only family.

276
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,670
He certainly wouldn't want

277
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,070
to be too far from the Green Flash Workshop.

278
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,020
You carried this wherever you went.

279
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,470
Let it keep you company here.

280
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,290
You can't stand being alone.

281
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,830
When you're bored, you can play a tune.

282
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,890
It can liven things up.

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,070
Biao.

[Here Lies Biao]

286
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,270
We'll definitely

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,620
avenge you.

288
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,610
Those scumbags!

289
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,840
They tried to kill us at our door.

290
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,740
I don't think we'll have peace in the future.

291
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,630
Instead of hiding here

292
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,770
in fear,

293
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,430
we might as well go back

294
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,390
and live our lives to the fullest

295
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,790
right under their noses.

296
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,670
I'm going back to Symphony City.

297
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,070
I'll become the best musician in the world.

298
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,270
I'll make the Green Flash Workshop famous in Dongsheng.

299
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,070
I'll show them

300
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,950
we can't be defeated easily!

301
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,670
Okay.

302
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,510
I'll go back with you.

303
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,670
It's time for me to settle the score

304
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,770
with Yun Shang.

305
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,950
I'll go with you.

306
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,400
Me too.

307
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,010
We're a team.

308
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,560
We do everything together.

309
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,750
Together!

310
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,200
I know you all want to avenge Biao,

311
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,920
but as you all know,

312
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,190
Su Ruofei was openly banished from Symphony City by His Majesty.

313
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,810
How is she going to go back?

314
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,580
Don't worry, guys.

315
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,520
I've found a way

316
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,520
to clear Ruofei's name.

317
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,350
I'll definitely bring you guys

318
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,010
back to Symphony City safely.

319
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,540
Good.

320
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,380
Then let's hit the road

321
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,080
and turn Symphony City upside down!

322
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,770
Okay!

323
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:23,810
Ruofei.

324
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,940
The decoction is ready.

325
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,880
Here. Let me feed you.

326
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,170
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

327
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,590
Okay.

328
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,950
Be careful.

329
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,200
Let me help you.

330
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,150
Here.

331
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,670
Give me your hand.

332
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,570
Does it still hurt?

333
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,830
It's all my fault.

334
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,600
I failed to protect you.

335
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,680
It's not your fault.

336
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,470
It's almost healed.

337
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,250
Don't worry.

338
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,810
Little Devil,

339
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,910
after we return to Symphony City,

340
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,390
you'll have to fight with Yun Shang.

341
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,510
When I think about

342
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,960
you being in danger at any time,

343
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,470
I'm worried.

344
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,170
Especially after Biao's death,

345
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,080
I just…

346
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,000
I understand.

347
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,900
Actually, in the past,

348
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,120
I just wanted to be a carefree Young Lord.

349
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,850
When Dongsheng needed me,

350
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,780
I'd give my father and Yun Shang my support.

351
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,540
When Dongsheng didn't need me,

352
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,850
I'd just stay with the one I love,

353
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,910
traveling and enjoying my life.

354
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,220
But now,

355
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,250
I can't just stand by and watch

356
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,360
Dongsheng fall into the hands of Yun Shang,

357
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,420
who is vindictive,

358
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,400
suspicious, and ruthless.

359
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,390
My father put in a lot of effort to make Dongsheng prosper.

360
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,270
I can't let Yun Sheng ruin everything.

361
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,000
Don't worry.

362
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,160
No matter what decision you make,

363
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,850
I'll always be by your side.

364
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,440
Oh, right.

365
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,000
There's one more thing.

366
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,450
Do you think Su Ruoshan

367
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,680
was behind this assassination attempt?

368
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,170
After the fire at the Symphony Workshop

369
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,110
and the incident with the jasper,

370
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,480
I've prepared for the worst.

371
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,130
After we go back this time,

372
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,780
I need to find closure with her.

373
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,570
Ruofei,

374
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,530
don't think too much.

375
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,170
Leave these things to me.

376
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,420
You can

377

You kept pushing me away,

which was why there were so many misunderstandings between us.

409
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,570
and hugged.

Why are you still so shy?

412

I just don't want you to misunderstand.

Maybe it was an accident at first,

419
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,700
but when I kissed you later,

420
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,100

why are you still treating me like this?

539
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,750

548
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,820
that revising the Dongsheng laws over and over

549
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,740
was to ensure that every law

550
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,290
could be fair and just,

562
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,910
that fire is strictly forbidden in the instrument room

00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,570
became quite suspicious.

566
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,950
I deduce that

567
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,430
the real arsonist

568
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,910
put a fuse in the candle

569
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,890
and used its burning time

570
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,400
to precisely design a delay mechanism.

571
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,950
This created an alibi for them

572
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,550
and ensured that the instrument room

573
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,110
would catch fire when Su Ruofei arrived,

574
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,430
so they could frame her.

575
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,870
How do you know this mechanism

576
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,100
wasn't designed by Su Ruofei herself

577
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,700
just to clear her name now?

578
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,580
Right after the room caught fire,

579
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,230
Su Ruofei was immediately arrested and detained at the Supervisory Office.

580
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,430
She didn't have time

581
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,900
to clean the wax on the corner of the table.

582
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,910
I noticed that the wax

583
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,350
had been mostly removed,

584
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,030
leaving only a thin layer.

585
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,020
This is enough to prove that the culprit is someone else,

586
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,230
and Su Ruofei was wrongly accused.

587
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,590
Father, I hope you can seek justice

588
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,990
for the wrongly accused.

589
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,270
Okay.

590
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,030
Su Ruofei can be temporarily cleared of suspicion,

591
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,250
but before the real culprit is caught,

592
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,270
she's not allowed to enter the Symphony Workshop.

593
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,290
Thank you, Father.

594
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,940
You're not like

595
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,710
a man of the Yun family at all,

596
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,440
you hopeless romantic.

597
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,840
You're the same, Father.

598
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,700
Mother is the only woman you love.

599
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,970
I'm just following your example.

600
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,480
Enough.

601
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,740
Go see your mother.

602
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,730
Yes.

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,980
Uncle.

605
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,390
Mu.

606
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,020
You're back so soon.

607
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,090
Did anything happen in Cloud City?

608
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,240
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

609
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,240
Cloud City is under your jurisdiction.

610
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,520
What could possibly happen

611
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,840
in your jurisdiction?

612
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,110
However, I've realized

613
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,430
one thing.

614
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,550
What is it?

615
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,920
There are things

616
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,190
I didn't care much about in the past,

617
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,670
but after seeing people try to take them

618
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,000
from me again and again,

619
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,380
I've started to find them

620
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,710
quite interesting.

621
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,560
Good. That's the spirit!

622
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,510
This is what a man of the Yun family should be like.

623
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,400
However,

624
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,780
those things may not be yours in the first place.

625
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:29,940
Mu,

626
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,900
a friendly reminder

627
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,550
that some things

628
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,460
are not for everyone to take.

629
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,850
How do you know, Uncle,

630
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,790
that I can't take them?

[Everlasting Music]

635
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,310
I can't believe the Young Lord actually convinced His Majesty

636
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,640
and cleared Fei's name.

637
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,000
Although

638
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,070
we're not allowed to enter that Symphony Workshop,

639
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,270
we don't think much of it anyway.

640
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,390
Yeah, exactly.

641
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,180
The Young Lord said

642
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,110
that the Young Lord's Mansion is not safe either,

643
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,550
so you shall run the Green Flash Workshop

644
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,150
in the house I bought for now.

645
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,860
We can stay together,

646
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,210
which can make things easier.

647
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,040
Shangyu,

648
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,120
before returning to Jin's Mansion,

649
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,320
I need to see someone.

650
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,240
I want to tell her

651
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,270
that I, Su Ruofei, am back,

652
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,960
and the Green Flash Workshop has come with me.

653
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,430
Given her past behavior,

654
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,580
you should avoid being alone with her.

655
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,690
With people watching,

656
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,290
she's not likely to hurt you,

657
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,110
but you can't be too careful.

658
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,470
Don't worry.

659
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,710
I'm no longer as naive as before.

660
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,770
Weren't you kicked out of Symphony City?

661
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,710
How dare you show your face here?

662
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,370
Zhou Ya.

663
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,140
Mind your manners.

664
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,350
His Majesty himself gave the order.

665
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,690
Musician Zhou, if you have any questions,

666
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,090
you can go to His Majesty.

667
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,830
His Majesty's order?

668
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,670
Obviously, the Young Lord has put in a word for her.

669
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,150
Someone knows very well that the Young Lord

670
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,810
is her future brother-in-law

671
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,750
but is still doing shameless things.

672
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,350
You…

673
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,730
Shameless!

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,310
Watch your language.

675
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,840
Who are you calling shameless?

676
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,230
The one who feels offended.

677
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,750
You…

678
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,750
I'm not here to argue with you.

679
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,760
I'm here to issue a challenge.

680
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,780
I'll lead my Green Flash Workshop

681
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,990
to challenge your Symphony Workshop.

682
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,180
If you have a problem,

683
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,660
let's see each other at music competitions in the future.

684
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,940
You're delusional.

685
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,000
With that shoddy workshop like yours,

686
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,220
you think you can make your name?

687
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,420
Ridiculous.

688
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,030
I must be a terrible musician

689
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,530
for being a member of her shabby workshop.

690
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,070
Master Jin.

691
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,280
Master Jin,

692
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,310
why did you lower yourself

693
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,310
to join such a third-rate workshop?

694
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,740
It's all because she's a vamp.

695
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,270
After seducing her own brother-in-law,

696
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,880
she seduced Master Jin.

697
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,390
Fei.

698
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,740
It's good that you're ambitious,

699
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,010
but you should know your limits.

700
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,550
I don't care about your antics in Cloud City,

701
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,490
but you shouldn't have brought your band

702
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,890
to the Symphony Workshop

703
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,790
to issue a challenge.

704
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,310
If I accepted it,

705
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,740
wouldn't I debase the Symphony Workshop?

706
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,670
If everyone came here

707
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,330
to issue a challenge like you,

708
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,990
my Symphony Workshop

709
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,270
would become a place anyone could tread upon.

710
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,840
Right.

711
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,700
Exactly.

712
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,990
Don't forget your place just because

713
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,150
you have the Young Lord's protection.

714
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,090
You don't call the shots

715
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,990
in the Symphony Workshop.

716
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,520
S-Su Ruoshan.

717
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,630
Who do you think you are?

718
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,270
You were originally just

719
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,950
the Su family's coachman's…

720
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,620
Shut up!

721
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,300
What did he say? I didn't hear it.

722
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,500
What did he say?

723
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,700
Don't talk nonsense.

724
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,630
You...

725
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,090
Rest assured.

726
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,880
I'll defeat the Symphony Workshop

727
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,990
fair and square

728
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,970
and become the music minister.
