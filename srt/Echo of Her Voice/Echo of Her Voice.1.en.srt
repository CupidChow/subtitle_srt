Boss.

195
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
The carriage can't go on.

196
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,190
Why don't you wait here?

197
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,640
Your mission's to seal off the workshop.

198
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,700
Don't hurt anyone.

199
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,510
If you see my sister,

200
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
bring her to me.

201
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,890
Yes.

202
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,870
You guys, come with me.

207
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,120
The complaint wasn't made

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,050
and Fei was taken to Mayor's Mansion?

209
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,760
What can we do?

210
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,320
Just wait for news.

211
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,330
I'm not confident

212
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,470
about this.

213
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,470
I heard Young Lord's a playboy.

214
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,490
He may have a crush on Fei

215
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,010
and wants her as his concubine.

216
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,040
Shut your lousy mouth!

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,890
It's very possible.

218
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,120
Honesty is brutal.

219
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,360
Believe it or not.

220
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,180
I'll go back first.

221
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,010
Goodness!

222
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,290
Melody Workshop's men are here again.

223
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,780
Go. Grab our weapons.

224
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,850
Let's go!

225
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,040
Listen, arrest Lady Ruofei first,

226
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,050
then seal off the workshop.

227
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,650
Yes.

229
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,040
Go!

230
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,770
Let's go.

231
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,980
Bring it on!

-Come on!
-Come again!

234
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,610
What now?

235
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,960
They still wouldn't cooperate.

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,770
Did you find Fei?

237
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,290
We didn't see her.

238
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
I think she wasn't there.

239
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,730
What's wrong with you guys?

240
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,090
They attacked us with rocks and chili water.

241
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,840
They're such clowns.

242
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,770

243
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,120
With all due respect,

L-Lady Ruofei

245
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,290
is so inconsiderate of you.

246
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,650
You're the reason

247
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,850
Green Flash Workshop's still open.

248
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,250
She is my sister.

249
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,860
Of course I'd protect her.

250
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,570
Fine, let her be for another two days.

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,730

to the east wing.

You must be Ms. Su Ruofei.

264
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,170
Do you know where the guard who brought me here

265
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,960
is?

266
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,810
He said he'd bring me to see Young Lord.

267
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,080
You mean Xiaoqi?

268
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,360
He's busy.

269
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,900
He sent me here to help you.

270
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,440
Can you take me

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,210
to Young Lord?

272
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,670
I'll take you there later.

277
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,560
sure are beautiful.

280
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,590
must match his good looks.

281
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,450
I heard he

282
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,410
selected each of them himself.

283
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,200
I also heard Young Lord's a playboy

284
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,520
with many lovers.

285
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,810
Hush.

286
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,270
Don't let others hear you.

287
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Seriously, Mu.

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,410
Why did you bring

289
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,320
so many fancy but useless things?

290
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,570
Isn't it tiring?

291
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,570
How are they fancy but useless?

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,810
For example,

297
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,080
this is potpourri.

298
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,010
When dancers sprinkle it on their dresses

299
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,890
while dancing,

300
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,090
fragrance fills the room.

It's wonderful.

-No need.

I appreciate it.

A sweaty general like me

307
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,600
won't need

308
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,090
such fancy stuff.

309
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,460
Keep it for yourself.

310
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,530
Don't say that.

311
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,730
Since I brought it for you,

312
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,520
just use it.

313
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,290
General Huang can use it too.

Ms. Su.

315
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,130
Young Lord asked you to wait for him here.

316
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,810
Okay.

317
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,560
Did he say when he'd come?

318
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,000
Well...

319
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,250
He didn't say.

320
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,960
Why don't you wait?

321
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,610
Thank you.

322
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,520
I wonder if Young Lord's easy to talk to.

323
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,250
What did he mean on the boat

324
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,530
when he asked me to follow him?

325
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,250
He was so vague.

326
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,810
It's getting late.

327
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,890
If he doesn't come,

328
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,620
my workshop will be sealed off.

329
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,210
I have to look for him.

330
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,720
This...

331
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,290
What is this?

332
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,240
Miss.

333
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,040
Young Lord asked you to take a bath and change.

334
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,240
A bath?

335
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,970
Yes.

336
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,270
Why does he want me to take a bath?

337
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,850
I also heard Young Lord's a playboy

338
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,920
with many lovers.

339
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,480
Does he really fancy me?

340
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,720
No wonder he asked me to follow him

341
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,210
and brought me home.

342
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,880
Now he even wants me to take a bath.

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,760
Wait.

344
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,170
Excuse me,

345
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,510
but I'm not used to being watched during my bath.

346
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,640
Why don't you go out first?

347
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,890
I'll call you in when I'm done.

348
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,650
Take your bath then.

349
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,530
Okay.

350
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,850
I was careless.

351
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,980
I thought he appreciated my talent,

352
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,700
but it was actually out of lust.

Why did I come to the bathing pool?

I'm walking into the trap.

362
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,720
So many petals.

363
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
It must've been used by a woman.

364
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,070
What a playboy.

365
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,310
Why must it be him?

366
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,010
This is bad.

367
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,100
I've sent myself to him.

368
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Why are you here?

369
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,260
I'm warning you.

370
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,250
Try something

371
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,690
and I'll scream for help.

372
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,490
I'll scream "molester"!

373
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,570
I should be the one...

374
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,810
screaming that.

375
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,090

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,220
Sorry.

377
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,530
Excuse me.

378
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,820
Young Lord, I heard...

379
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,280
Get out.

380
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,290
Yes.

381
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,740
Seen enough?

382
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,210
I saw nothing.

383
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,330
After seeing and touching my body,

384
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,200
you want to leave?

385
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,350
Nonsense.

386
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,850
I didn't peep at you.

387
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,200
Who were you trying to peep at?

388
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,160
I want to peep...

389
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,040
No.

390
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,650
No one.

391
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,790
I want...

392
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,750
I'm here to complain.

393
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,440
Complain?

394
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,160
[Dew Pool]

395
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,640
Here's the thing.
[Dew Pool]

396
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,030
Here's the thing.

397
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,910
I heard you'll be choosing Symphony Workshop's

398
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,130
musicians this time.

399
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,170
They'll get the chance

400
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,350
to become Dongsheng's No. 1 musician

401
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,310
and the music minister,

402
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,970
and perform for Madam Yaoshan

403
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,090
at Jiuru Banquet.

404
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,530
You're right.

405
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,240
But the musician audition system

406
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,410
is so unfair.

407
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,050
Ruoshan.

408
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,050
Why can't we join the audition?

409
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,810
The mayor's notice clearly said

410
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,770
all musicians are eligible.

411
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,650
You have to be a musician first.

412
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,640
But your buddies

413
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,050
haven't even passed

414
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,180
the 7th-level exam.

415
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,520
Because they weren't allowed

416
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,890
to take the exam!

417
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,490
Monkey Zhao was disqualified

418
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,610
for being too fat;

419
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,680
Biao for his lowly background;

420
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,370
Eleven for being "disabled" for having six fingers

421
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,690
despite meeting all requirements.

422
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,930
They're all talented.

423
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,490
The rules are problematic.

424
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,870
I didn't set the rules.

425
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,510
You've been in Melody Workshop too.

426
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,970
You should know the rules.

427
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,050
Then we don't stand a chance?

428
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,980
They don't,

429
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
but you do.

430
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,270
I told you to stop

431
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,100
hanging out with those people.

432
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,340
You're the Su family's second young miss.

433
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,790
Join Melody Workshop with dignity

434
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,270
and you'll qualify

435
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,860
for the musician audition.

436
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,860
No.

437
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,520
I can't leave them behind.

438
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,230
We have to join it together.

439
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,210
When will you

440
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,040
stop making me worry for you?

441
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,700
Don't go to Green Flash Workshop these days.

442
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,780
Stay at home.

443
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,680
From tomorrow onwards,

444
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,740
Mayor will seal off all private workshops,

445
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,070
including Green Flash.

446
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,650
Why?

447
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,800
Private workshops are vulgar crowds.

448
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,000
What if someone inept

449
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,530
tries to join the audition?

450
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,640
If Young Lord's offended,

451
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,990
Cloud City's reputation will be tarnished.

452
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,400
That’s unfair.

453
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,290
So only

454
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,380
Melody Workshop musicians can join?

455
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,650
Mayor set the rules.

456
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,630
It's not up to me.

457
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
That's why you beat the drums on the roof

458
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,510
to get my attention

459
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,340
to make this complaint?

460
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,940
Yes.

461
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,910
I have a way to save your workshop.

462
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,780
But I need you to promise me one thing.

463
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,970
No.

464
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,170
I haven't said it yet.

465
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,800
I've long heard you're a playboy.

466
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,730
Although I really want to save my workshop,

467
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,700
I'll never sell

468
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,570
my body.

469
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,010
You'd better give up.

470
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,380
Do you think I fancy you?

471
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't you?

472
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,350
Do you want me to fancy you?

473
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,090
Who cares for that?

474
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,150
Then why did you ask me to follow you?

475
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,300
You even said...

476
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,890
to meet you after a bath.

477
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,620
As a commoner,

478
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,210
it's what you should do

479
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,900
before meeting me.

480
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,170
Besides,

481
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,320
I asked you to follow me

482
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,090
to be my private entertainer.

483
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,160
Private entertainer?

484
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,800
Yes.

485
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,850
No way.

486
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,220
I'm the boss of Green Flash Workshop.

487
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,500
How can I be your private entertainer?

488
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Is your workshop all that?

489
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,410
Listen up.

490
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,520
Green Flash Workshop

491
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,350
is Cloud City's top workshop.

492
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,650
Fine.

493
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,650
I'll give you a chance.

494
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,940
I’ll visit your workshop later.

495
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,780
If your music moves me,

496
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,890
I might consider

497
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,150
bringing you to Symphony City to perform.

498
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:37,750
Really?

499
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:38,880
Of course.

500
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,810
Pinky swear.

501
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,990
You don't know this?

502
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,260
I'll go back and prepare.

503
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,930
Bye.

504
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,070
See you.

505
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,090
I’ll wait for you.

506
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,570
Young Lord.

507
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,090
W-Why did you let her go?

508
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,090
For the last 12 years,

509
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,460
we've tried everything

510
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,100
to cure your hearing.

511
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,590
How could you let her go...

512
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,130
How fascinating.

513
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,190
I actually can hear her music.

514
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,400
Then why did you let her go?

515
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,060
Come with me somewhere later.

516
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:32,850
Ruoshan?

517
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,580
Fei.

518
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,680
Why are you here?

519
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,110
Why do you think I'm here?

520
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,560
What did you do?

521
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,240
Why did Young Lord arrest you?

522
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,050
You found out?

523
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,530
I know everything

524
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,010
that goes on in Cloud City.

525
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,520
When

526
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,310
will you stop worrying me

527
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,460
and behave?

528
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,610
It's not trouble.

529
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,470
I just asked Young Lord for help.

530
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,780
What is it that even I can't

531
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,880
help you with it?

532
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,770
It's too big of a deal.

533
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,000
So big that you've to trouble Young Lord?

534
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,810
I asked Young Lord to save my workshop.

535
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,050
Ruoshan.

536
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,370
Young Lord's agreed.

537
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,650
I have to go

538
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,900
and prepare at the workshop.

539
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,160
Bye.

540
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,450
[Mayor's Mansion]
Bye.

541
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,890
[Mayor's Mansion]

542
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,490
[Mayor's Mansion]

543
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
Mu's taking forever

544
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,700
for a bath.

545
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,850
[Knowledge Comes From the Laws of Nature]

546
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,510
Shanshan!
[Knowledge Comes From the Laws of Nature]

547
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,560
[Knowledge Comes From the Laws of Nature]

548
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,500
Greetings, Mayor.
[Knowledge Comes From the Laws of Nature]

549
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,160
Greetings, Mayor.

550
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,530
I've told you

551
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,650
not to be so polite

552
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,410
when it's just us.

553
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,280
I should reciprocate

554
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,130
your kindness with respect.

555
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,040
Sure, sure, as you please.

556
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,300
Come. Have a seat.

557
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,820
Here.

558
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,620
Mayor.

559
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,900
Has Young Lord arrived?

560
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,580
Yes.

561
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,810
He's scrubbing down.

562
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,210
Sorry for being crude.

563
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,120
You're straightforward.

564
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,720
It's okay.

565
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,630
Shanshan.

566
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,720
Do your best at today's dinner.

567
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,200
I'll speak up for you.

568
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,510
You've looked out for me

569
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,840
for many things lately.

570
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,270
I'm very grateful.

571
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,200
It's what I should do.

572
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,080
You want to join Symphony Workshop,

573
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,280
so I must help you.

574
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,890
But after thinking about it,

575
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,440
Symphony and Cloud cities are so far away.

576
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,480
I’m worried you can't adapt.

577
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,320
Look.

578
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,340
Your parents

579
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,720
and sister are here.

580
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,630
I'm here too.

581
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,610
Must you go to Symphony City?

582
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,250
You should know

583
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,940
my long-term goal of becoming

584
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,330

585
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,560
What’s so good about that?

586
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Does it beat being the mayor's wife?

587
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,090
I'm determined

588
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,360
to pass the audition.

589
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,210
If you have concerns,

590
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,040
don't be troubled because of me.

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,560
What's wrong with me today?

593
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,340
I keep saying the wrong things.

594
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,580
-I really...
-Mayor.

595
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,760
Greetings, Mayor Yun.

596
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,410
Is the scrubbing...

597
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,200
Is he done?

598
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,330
Young Lord's tired after his bath.

599
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,420
He asked me to tell you

600
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,880
he's skipping the dinner.

601
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,930
Seriously.

602
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,980
How tiring can scrubbing be?

603
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,080
All right, I got it.

604
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,910
Let him rest.

605
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,530
Yes.

606
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,900
Look at my nephew.

607
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,810
He should stay with me

608
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:40,930
and train.

609
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,190
He's too delicate.

610
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,130
It's okay.

611
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,540
Let's enjoy the food ourselves.

612
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,070
Let’s go.

613
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,970
Since Young Lord isn't here to watch me perform,

614
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,840
I'll take my leave.

615
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,420
Shanshan, don't leave in a hurry.

616
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,510
Sorry for saying

617
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,020
the wrong things.

618
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,820
Why'd I be angry with the mayor?

619
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,410
I'm just busy with my workshop's affairs.

620
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,410
I'll visit you again.

621
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,940

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,230

Don't creep up on me

632
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,490

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,350
I just saw Young Lord and Xiaoqi

635
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,220
leaving through the back door.

636
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Didn't he need to rest?

637
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,150
Where did he go?

638
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,670
Based on the direction,

639
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,130
he might've left the city.

Why don't we take the chance to...

641
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,530
Answer me.

642
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,900
Why doesn't Shanshan like me?

643
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,810
Because I'm not youthful enough?

644
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,110
Did you see Yun Mu's face?

645
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,210
He's pretty

646
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,470

647
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,870
Why don't I scrub down too?

648

Scrub down!

that noblemen

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,950
-Thank you, Young Lord.
-Thank you, Young Lord.

766
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,700
Pardon me, an official,

767
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,680
for this

768
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,360
shoddy welcome.

769
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,210
Are you

770
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,350
an official?

771
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,890
Young Lord.

772
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,270
I'm Su Ruoshan, the boss of Melody Workshop,

773
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,180
Cloud City's official workshop.

774
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,030
I'm a senior music official.

775
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,230
So you're Boss Su.

776
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,040
May I ask why you're here?

777
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,520
I...

778
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,650
She is my sister.

779
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,350
It's normal for her to be here.

780
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,390
Young Lord,

781
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,720
please.

782
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,680
Can we start performing?

783
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,620
Come on.
