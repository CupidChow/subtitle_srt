00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,770
It's the melody I often heard in Cloud City.

00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,600
How thoughtful of you.

7
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,750
Madam.

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,790
It wasn't I who was thoughtful.

9
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,530
It was the Young Lord.

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,150
The Young Lord often mentioned it to me.

11
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,110
He said you

12
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,230
missed the melodies of Cloud City very much.

13
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,450
So I kept it in mind.

14
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,490
Today, I arranged it and brought it over specially.

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,990
Both of you children are so considerate.

22

Go quickly, then.

23
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,600

Shadow has returned.

26

I have returned late.

27
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,850
Please forgive me.

28
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,430
What exactly happened?

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,160
Weren't you captured by Yun Mu?

30
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,210
I found out that last night,

31
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,680
I wasn't the only one who snuck into

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,310
the Young Lord's Mansion and was caught.

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,540
It seemed that a bunch of fanatic supporters

34
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,900
of Jin Shangyu snuck in.

35
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,550
I was implicated by them

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,190
and hid in the woodshed to avoid trouble.

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,520
I continued my investigation after that.

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,440
I see.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,510
Then tell me, did you find any information?

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,950
I saw it clearly.

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,030
That Lord of Leisure is naturally frivolous.

42
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,870
He indulges in flirting with entertainers all day.

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,080
He's extravagant and licentious.

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,810
He truly cannot compare to you.

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,200
What did I tell you?

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,930
This guy is just someone who seeks pleasure.

47
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,790
But Mayor,

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,660
don't you think it's a bit too coincidental?

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,430
First, he let us see

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,230

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,790
Then, Shadow discovered

52
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,750
him flirting with the entertainers.

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,310
It seems like he's showing us

54
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,120
exactly what we want to see.

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,950
But think about it again.

56
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,550
When he was attacked in Cloud City,

57
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,150
he was so heroic and valiant.

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,270
Now that you mention it,

59
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,000

What's wrong, Ruofei?

134
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,870
Is there any difficulty?

135

She can still sleep after I kissed her?

153
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,830
She must be too embarrassed to face me.

That's why she rushed to sleep.

Well, never mind.

Why do I keep thinking about this?

158

I must be unwilling to let her get away with taking advantage of me.

When will he finally go to sleep?

160

Please have a seat, Master Jin.

190
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,030
I'll get you something to eat and drink.

191
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,910
Just some water will do.

192
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,730
Alright.

193
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,930
[Puppet Show Theater]

194
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,110
[Puppet Show Theater]

195
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,170
I'm sorry, Shangyu.

196
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm late.

197
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,540
Once upon a time in the Green Flash Forest,

198
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,000
there was a little boy.

199
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,950
He was square and round,

200
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,040
introverted and timid.

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,840
The other children bullied and ignored him.

202
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,370
Until one day,

203
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,680
he met a

204
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,350
passionate and domineering little girl.

205
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,890
The little girl said to the little boy,

206
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,010
"I'll protect you from now on."

207
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,130
"You can call me Fei."

208
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,710
Fei,

209
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,190
this tree is too tall.

210
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,680
I can't climb up.

211
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,890
You're too fat.

212
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,940
If you keep getting fatter,

213
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,600
I won't play with you anymore.

214
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,860
Fei,

215
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,030
what should we do?

216
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,370
How about this?

217
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,870
I'll tie a rope around you from now on.

218
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
That way, you'll be able to climb up.

219
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,050
Fei, you're so nice.

220
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,710
Fei had many strange ideas.

221
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,330
The little boy was always happy when he followed her.

222
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,030
He gradually understood what dreams were,

223
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,590
and he realized what goal he should work towards.

224
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,060
Fei said, "In the future, I want to build"

225
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,260
"the best music workshop in the world."

226
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,650
"And I want to build it on a tree."

227
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,430
I'll build a music workshop on this tree

228
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,470
so we can see the stars just by looking up.

229
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,670
Do you want to join me?

230
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes.

231
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,200
Good.

232
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,870
Then you're the first member

233
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,030
of my workshop.

234
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,970
What's the name of our workshop?

235
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,370
"Green Flash Workshop."

236
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,290
Little Fatty Yu.

237
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,350
Fei.

238
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,960
It's really you.

239
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,760
It's me.

240
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,120
I never thought

241
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,340
that the chubby boy in my memory

242
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
would turn out to be Master Jin, whom I admire the most.

243
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,690
How did you lose so much weight?

244
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,880
I remember your face

245
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,370
being twice as big as it is now.

246
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,770
Because I haven't eaten buns for a long time,

247
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,370
so I've lost weight.

248
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,910
How come you don't even eat

249
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,730
your favorite buns anymore?

250
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,260
This change is too drastic.

251
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

252
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,320
I've told you many times already.

253
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,850
You just didn't believe me.

254
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,380
That's true.

255
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,620
Who would have thought

256
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,950
that the world-renowned genius musician

257
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,510
was actually my little crybaby sidekick

258
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,020
from the past?

259
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,840
Fei,

260
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,390
I promised you I'd study music diligently.

261
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,930
So, Fei,

262
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,470
did I make you proud?

263
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,070
I can't believe you still remember that.

264
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,130
I remember every word you've ever said.

265
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,940
Good boy.

266
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,790
Look at you now.

267
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,900
You've grown into

268
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,960
such an impressive master musician.

269
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,440
But when I see you,

270
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,010
I'm reminded of the little Shangyu who used to follow me around,

271
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,980
crying, fussing, and being adorable.

272
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,880
I still can't help but want to pat his head.

273
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,970
No matter how I change,

274
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,390
I'll always be that

275
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,850
little sidekick who likes to be by your side.

276
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,190
That has never changed.

277
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,980
Such a good boy.

278
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,230
So, when you went back to Cloud City,

279
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,000
was it to find me?

280
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,680
Actually,

281
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,780
I've never forgotten

282
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,710
our days in the Green Flash Forest.

283
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,470
I've always wanted to tell you...

284
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,160
I...

285
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,300
I...

286
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,270
That's strange.

287
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,580
I don't remember

288
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,740
you had a stutter when you were young.

289
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,910
Fei,

290
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,590
what I want to say is...

291
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,380
From now on, I don't want to be just your idol

292
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,070
or your sidekick.

293
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,170
I want to be your...

294
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,120
What?

295
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,870
Your...

296
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,350
You two are in quite a good mood.

297
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,210
What scene are you acting out in the middle of the night?

298
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,510
Why are you here?

299
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,240
I should be the one asking you that.

300
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,170
Why are you here?

301
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,020
I...

302
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,720
Young Lord,

303
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,460
I invited Ruofei here.

304
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,150
If you have any issues with that,

305
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,310
please blame me.

306
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,270
Mr. Jin, although you are my honored guest,

307
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,030
isn't it a bit inappropriate for you

308
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,890
to privately meet my entertainer

309
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,490
in the middle of the night?

310
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,990
What private meeting?

311
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,980
Shangyu is my childhood friend,

312
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,010
not some stranger.

313
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,320
There's no need for propriety.

314
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,850
Childhood friend?

315
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,810
That's right.

316
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,570
Ruofei and I have known each other since we were children.

317
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,300
There's no need for propriety.

318
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,060
Moreover,

319
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,580
when you first invited me to Symphony City,

320
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,780
you should have known

321
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
that I'm not one to be bound by conventions.

322
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,700
In my opinion,

323
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
although Ruofei is your private entertainer,

324
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,430
she should still have her own freedom.

325
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,390
Mr. Jin, I admire

326
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,610
your free spirit.

327
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,120
However, that's your business.

328
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,290
My entertainer

329
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
must follow my rules.

330
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,290
You. Let's go.

331
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,900
What for?

332
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,650
What?

333
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,430
Do you want me to

334
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,590
read your letter of commitment out loud?

335
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,110
You...

336
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,540
Shangyu.

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,230
I'm really sorry.

338
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,040
Let's talk next time.

339
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,020
Alright.

340
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,170
Talk to you next time.

341
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,510
I get it now.

342
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,390
So Su Ruofei

343
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,690
is actually your childhood sweetheart.

344
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,100
Why are you here?

345
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,630
As soon as you left today,

346
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,830
I followed you.

347
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,810
Where are you going?

348
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,390
Su Ruofei is done playing,

349
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,920
but I haven't even started.

350
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,180
What do you want to play?

351
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,080
I'll play with you.

352
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,610
Look.

353
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,410
Play whatever you want by yourself.

354
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,510
I have things to do.

355
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,610
What's this about?

356
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,780
I also enjoy puppet shows.

357
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
Why don't you perform one for me?

358
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,180
Why should I?

359
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,910
I won't perform.

360
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,080
Won't perform?

361
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,460
Xiaoqi.

362
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,430
[Letter of Commitment]

363
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,530
The letter of commitment.

364
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,440
I, Su Ruofei, solemnly promise

365
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,240
that I will never go to Jin Shangyu at night in the future.

366
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,600
I will be mindful of the propriety between men and women,

367
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,700
and uphold the reputation of the Young Lord's Mansion.

368
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,110
Otherwise, I will submit to the Young Lord's punishment.

369
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,670
Give it back to me.

370
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,850
This doesn't count.

371
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,080
When I wrote this letter of commitment,

372
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,750
I didn't know

373
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,090
that Shangyu was my childhood friend.

374
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,540
Does being childhood friends mean you can disregard propriety?

375
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,650
Is he not a man or are you not a woman?

376
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,910
Didn't you promise

377
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,170
to return the letter of commitment to me?

378
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,250
Give it back to me.

379
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,470
I was planning to return it to you,

380
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,450
but I didn't expect

381
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,440
that such a thing would happen today.

382
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,470
I think that

383
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,600
some rules still need to be set for you.

384
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,260
I'll keep this letter of commitment for now.

385
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,660
Scoundrel.

386
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,740
Say that again.

387
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,640
You really are a scoundrel.

388
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,890
Xiaoqi.

389
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,950
House rule number 18:

390
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,960
Anyone who defies or insults the Young Lord

391
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,810
shall receive 50 strokes of the cane.

392
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,350
Did you hear that clearly?

393
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,870
Xiaoqi.

394
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,310
Have someone prepare some late-night snacks.

395
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,780
The night is young.

396
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,500
I should savor it slowly.

397
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,910
Yes.

398
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,680
What are you still waiting for?

399
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
Begin.

400
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,370
Alright.

401
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,630
Since you're so eager to hear

402
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,130
and watch a good show,

403
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,030
I'll perform for you the story

404
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,470
of a shameless Young Lord forcibly taking a charming commoner girl.

405
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,230
How's that?

406
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,310
Begin.

407
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,170
Why is he pretending to be so magnanimous?

408
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,390
Let's see how long you can endure.

409
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,200
Once upon a time, there was a Young Lord

410
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,160
called the Shameless Young Lord.

411
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,180
He thought himself as handsome as a celestial being,

412
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,030
but he was quite pitiful.

413
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,950
He had never looked in a mirror,

414
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,620
and no one dared to tell him

415
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,110
that he was actually extremely ugly.

416
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,130
Why are you looking at me?

417
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,130
Go on.

418
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,630
If you dare to watch, I dare to perform.

419
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,810
This ugly Young Lord is not only hideous,

420
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,650
but he also stinks terribly.

421
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,560
He has to bathe eight times a day.

422
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,470
But no matter how many times he bathes,

423
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,230
he still stinks.

424
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,760
Because he's not only physically smelly,

425
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,620
his nature and his temper stink too.

426
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,920
One day,

427
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,890
a charming commoner girl was happily walking down the street.

428
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,400
Suddenly, she encountered this shameless Young Lord.

429
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,710
This shameless Young Lord

430
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,910
kept chasing her.

431
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,910
The girl cried, 'Help! Help! Help!'

432
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,060
Stop chasing me!

433
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,550
The performance was quite enthusiastic.

434
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,430
Run, run!

435
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,810
It looks like a supernatural tale.

436
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,960
Could it be a mountain demon abducting a beauty?

437
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,300
The shameless Young Lord is still chasing her,

438
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,660
keeping on chasing and chasing.

439
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,990
This little devil tormented me all night.

440
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,740
Now my arms are so sore.

441
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,510
I've insulted him so much,

442
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,620
yet he still seems quite happy.

443
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,630
He's really thick-skinned

444
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,790
and shameless.

445
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,510
Fei.

446
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,070
Shangyu.

447
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,530
Come, sit down.

448
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,270
Have one.

449
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,800
I don't like to eat that.

450
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,250
You've really changed.

451
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,150
You used to eat whatever I gave you.

452
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,910
I was afraid that one day,

453
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,190
you might eat me too.

454
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,610
It's not that exaggerated.

455
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,030
Did the Young Lord give you any trouble yesterday?

456
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,510
How could he dare to trouble me?

457
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
That's good then.

458
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,100
If the Young Lord doesn't treat you well,

459
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,140
I can take you away anytime.

460
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,360
No, that won't do.

461
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,060
I still have to stay here and be his entertainer.

462
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,010
Are you that eager to be an entertainer?

463
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,890
It's not that I want to.

464
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,950
It's just...

465
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,150
I called out to you several times from up there.

466
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,230
Didn't you hear me?

467
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Wait a minute.

468
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,240
Something's wrong.

469
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,590
What's wrong?

470
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,780
He's actually an utterly hideous freak.

471
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,070
Why are you looking at me?

472
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,890
Go on.

473
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
Something's off.

474
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,170
Something's definitely off.

475
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,190
Before, when I said anything bad about him,

476
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,450
he would react like I stepped on his tail.

477
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,350
Yesterday I insulted him all night,

478
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,310
yet he didn't react at all.

479
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,630
I need to figure this out.

480
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,110
Ruofei.

481
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,030
What's wrong?

482
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,960
Something crossed my mind.

483
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,820
I have to go now.

484
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,390
As I thought, he can't hear.

485
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,780
Your petty tricks won't scare me.

486
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,600
How childish.

487
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,260
What are you trying to do?

488
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,460
Still not letting go?

489
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,630
Damn it.

490
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,110
He tricked me again.

491
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,320
Could it be that...

492
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,470
I'm overthinking it?

493
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,150
I understand now.

494
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,030
So all these mirrors in the mansion

495
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,120
aren't just for vanity.

496
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,630
Oh, you little devil.

497
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,710
Looks like you finally have a flaw

498
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,000
that I can take advantage of.

499
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,990
I must get to the bottom of this.

500
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,640
Shanshan.

501
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:03,910
Shanshan.

502
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,710
Come here and take a look.

503
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,370
See what I've brought for you.

504
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,360
Shanshan.

505
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,720
Shanshan.

506
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,430
Shanshan.

507
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,520
How have you been lately?

508
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,890
Greetings, Mayor.

509
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,900
Did I interrupt your practice?

510
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,040
It's my fault.

511
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,600
I'll be more careful next time.

512
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,190
Come here.

513
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,330
Come over and take a look.

514
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,460
I've brought you lots of delicious treats.

515
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,340
Come on.

516
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,160
Here.

517
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
I'd searched all over Symphony City

518
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,870
before I found these.

519
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,870
Your favorite Cloud City's snacks.

520
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,610
Come on.

521
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,770
Try them and see if they suit your taste.

522
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,350
Come here.

523
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,820
Sit down.

524
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,630
If the food here doesn't suit your taste,

525
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,560
just let me know.

526
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,770
I'll bring a chef from Cloud City later.

527
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,850
Oh yeah.

528
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,830
Huang Fu.

529
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,910
Come in.

530
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,250
Here.

531
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,290
Open it.

532
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,760
These are all popular accessories in Symphony City.

533
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,400
I'm not sure what you like,

534
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,260
so I've bought out several of the best shops

535
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,430
in Symphony City.

536
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,810
You can go and choose for yourself later.

537
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,950
Here, take a look at these.

538
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,890
See if you like them.

539
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,370
Don't worry.

540
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,720
As long as I'm here,

541
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,430
when it comes to food, drink, and clothing,

542
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,640
I won't let you be inferior to any other musician.

543
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,410
Mayor.

544
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,190
I came here to study the art of music.

545
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,290
We don't lack anything here.

546
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,870
Please don't spend any more money.

547
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,710
Fine.

548
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,790
I understand.

549
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,810
Look at this beautiful sunny day.

550
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,420
I've heard that Jiuyu Mountain outside the city has beautiful scenery.

551
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,300
Why don't we go enjoy the spring scenery together?

552
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,010
No, thanks.

553
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,730
I want to practice as much as I can now.

554
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,130
If I can't be the best,

555
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,780
it's a failure for me.

556
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,990
Alright.

557
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,970
So you want to practice.

558
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,400
What should I do with my day then?

559
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,830
Isn't that the harp I gave you?

560
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm very attached to that harp.

561
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,150
From Cloud City to Symphony City,

562
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,480
I've kept the harp with me the entire time.

563
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,960
If you have nothing else to do,

564
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,720
why don't you have some tea here?

565
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,590
I'll play a song for you.

566
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,110
No need.

567
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,110
Don't bother.

568
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,100
You go practice your instrument.

569
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,070
Don't worry about me.

570
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,730
I'll just drink tea by myself.

571
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,750
[Young Lord's Mansion]

572
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,510
Little devil.

573
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,360
No reaction?

574
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,830
Narcissist.

575
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,200
I understand now.

576
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,870
He needs to see my lips

577
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,050
to know what I'm saying.

578
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,790
Little devil, narcissist.

579
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,950
Sadistic monster.

580
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,930
Come back.

581
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,920
Just now...

582
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,280
Young Lord.

583
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Why did the drumbeat suddenly stop?

584
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,750
He can tell I made a mistake with the drums,

585
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,210
but can't hear me speak.

586
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,620
Could it be that he can only hear music?

587
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,810
That's too bizarre.

588
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,790
Young Lord.

589
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,270
You're being unfair.

590
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,750
That sister also made a mistake with her flute just now,

591
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,200
why didn't you say anything to her?

592
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,000
I didn't notice the flute sound.

593
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,250
I was only focused on your drumming.

594
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,910
I'm sorry, Young Lord.

595
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,430
It turns out that the sister was playing a vertical flute.

596
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,040
I'll continue playing now.

597
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,990
Go ahead.

598
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,150
Unexpectedly,

599
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,550
the Young Lord is actually deaf in both ears.

600
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,290
He has to rely on reading people's lips

601
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,070
to know what they're saying.

602
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,910
But how could he hear my music?

603
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,160
He's quite pitiful when I think about it.

604
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,150
He's so arrogant on a daily basis.

605
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,310
Perhaps it's to cover up

606
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,390
his deep-seated insecurity.

607
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,270
Su Ruofei, wake up!

608
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,470
How can you sympathize

609
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,670
with this little devil who's using you?

610
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,770
There's an assassin!

611
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,460
An assassin?

612
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,120
Why are they here again?

613
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,400
Don't scream,

614
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,640
or I'll kill you.

615
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,810
Great hero,

616
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,150
please spare my life.

617
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,660
If you want money, I don't have a penny.

618
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,510
If you want my body...

619
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,950
I can't offer that either.

620
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,280
Stop talking nonsense.

621
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,500
I know you're Yun Mu's most favored entertainer.

622
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,270
Just tell me Yun Mu's secrets,

623
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,670
and I'll spare your life.

624
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,030
Great hero,

625
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,520
you must be mistaken.

626
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,610
The Young Lord always treats me coldly.

627
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,950
Look, he even makes me live in this storage room.

628
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,510
How can you call that favoritism?

629
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,760
If you want to live, speak up quickly.

630
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,790
Ouch!

631
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,070
I'll tell you!

632
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,990
I'll tell you!

633
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,780
The Young Lord has body odor.

634
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,030
He bathes at least eight times a day.

635
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,550
And he's extremely narcissistic.

636
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,470
He looks in the mirror eight hundred times a day.

637
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,870
He thinks he's the most

638
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,330
handsome man in the world.

639
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,990
I don't want to hear that.

640
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,490
I want to know a more secret

641
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,500
and lethal weakness.

642
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,550
Lethal?

643
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,070
Well, being deaf in both ears should count, right?

644
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,010
Tell me.

645
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,950
Okay.

646
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,430
I'll tell you.

647
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,620
The Young Lord is extremely lecherous.

648
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,790
He keeps countless beautiful women in captivity,

649
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,020
but in reality, he's impotent.

650
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,750
He sleeps in his own room every night.

651
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,680
I really don't know anything else.

652
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,360
If that's not enough,

653
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,910
you might as well kill me.

654
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,900
Spare me!

655
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,930
Great hero, please spare my life!

656
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,130
Spare me, great hero!

657
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,060
Oh, it's you.

658
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,900
There was an assassin!

659
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,290
I'm already aware of this matter.

660
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,310
However, by the time I found you,

661
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,990
the assassin had already escaped.

662
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,180
Escaped?

663
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,350
That's right.

664
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,580
How could you let him escape?

665
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,480
Did the assassin say anything to you?

666
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,480
What else could he say?

667
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,990
Wasn't he just after you?

668
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,790
He even forced me to reveal your weakness.

669
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,340
Why am I so unlucky?

670
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,270
He came twice,

671
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,070
and I covered for you both times.

672
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,160
Well, he didn't kill you.

673
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,710
That means you must have revealed my weakness.

674
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,060
How could I possibly reveal your weakness?

675
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,950
I definitely told him righteously that

676
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,630
the Young Lord is unparalleled in this world.

677
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,880
You have no weaknesses at all.

678
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,220
Well said.

679
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,420
I'm indeed unparalleled

680
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,780
and have no weaknesses.

681
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,000
Even if there were any weaknesses,

682
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,600
it's not for a clueless, brainless

683
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,780
entertainer like you to know.

684
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,630
Who says I'm brainless?

685
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,630
You really think you've hidden it well?

686
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,380
It's just that you can't hear, right?

687
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,610
So you've discovered it after all.

688
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,290
Do you know that in this world,

689
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,170
there are two types of people who know this secret?

690
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,030
One type

691
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,670
is my people,

692
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,350
and the other

693
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,170
is dead people.

694
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,750
Young Lord.

695
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,450
I swear.

696
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,750
I am your people.

697
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,800
I am your exclusive entertainer,

698
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,200
one of a kind.

699
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,510
Even when that assassin

700
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,390
held a knife to my throat,

701
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,640
I didn't betray you.

702
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,240
Then why didn't you tell him?

703
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,030
I'm very loyal to my friends.

704
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,180
I never do anything to betray my friends.

705
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,030
Friends?

706
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,390
You, a mere entertainer,

707
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,590
dare to befriend me?

708
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,880
However, considering your loyalty,

709
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,100
I'll grant you a new position.

710
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,780
Starting from today,

711
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,830
you'll be my ears.

712
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,510
Ears?

713
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,300
I got it.

714
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,590
Previously, you relied on lip-reading

715
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,830
to understand what others were saying.

716
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,920
But sometimes it's not convenient to do that.

717
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,230
So, I need to use my music

718
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,930
to tell you, right?

719
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,410
As expected of someone I chose.

720
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,850
You catch on quickly.

721
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,230
But being your ears,

722
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,620
what's in it for me?

723
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,430
If you're willing to help me properly,

724
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,800
I can assist you in re-entering the Symphony Workshop

725
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,690
and restoring your music status.

726
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,220
No way.

727
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,460
Restoring a music status

728
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,850
is a thing of the past.

729
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,610
How can you lump them together?

730
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,200
Then what do you want?

731
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,760
I want my own private chamber.

732
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,660
No way.

733
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,110
As my ears,

734
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,270
you must be with me at all times.

735
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,190
But I...

736
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,380
Think of something practical.

737
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,380
Otherwise, don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

738
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,070
Alright.

739
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,030
Young Lord.

740
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,590
Do you really want to switch beds with me?

741
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,130
I'm afraid the low couch

742
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,030
won't accommodate your noble status.

743
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,300
My bed is specially customized.

744
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,860
It will take some time to transport the new one here.

745
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,700
But you're right about that.

746
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,280
How about I make do and squeeze in with you for a few days?

747
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,670
No need.

748
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,270
You'd better keep your noble status to yourself.

749
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,100
Haitang.

750
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,370
I don't like this scent.

751
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,510
It's too pungent.

752
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,140
Do you have something milder and sweeter?

753
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,820
Change it to chamomile and lily.

754
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,660
Also,

755
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,750
I like Hall crabapples.

756
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,910
Ask someone to plant some in the courtyard for me.

757
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,760
I also like black and red koi fish.

758
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,490
Ask someone to raise some in the courtyard for me.

759
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,070
And...

760
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,950
What else?

761
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,170
That's all for now.

762
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,030
Oh yeah.

763
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,150
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

764
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,840
You can't hear,

765
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,550
so how do you know

766
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,950
what others are playing?

767
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,370
You mean

768
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,190
you've memorized all these music scores?

769
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,630
Of course.

770
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,360
Since I lost my hearing,

771
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,450
to prevent others from noticing,

772
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,010
I collected all the music scores in the world

773
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,680
and memorized them all.

774
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,010
[Qin Score]

775
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,770
As long as I see someone's fingering,
[Qin Score]

776
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:44,890
As long as I see someone's fingering,

777
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,530
I can tell

778
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,890
what piece they're playing.

779
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,950
[Qin Score]

780
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,550
How long did it take to practice
[Qin Score]

781
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,070
and memorize all that?
[Qin Score]

782
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,310
and memorize all that?

783
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,240
I'm starting to admire you.

784
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,760
Haven't you admired me from the beginning?

785
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,180
I solemnly take back

786
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,760
what I just said.

787
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,100
But if you can't hear other people's music,

788
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,470
why can you still hear my music?

789
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,470
I'd like to know that too.

790
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,960
So I investigated at your home

791
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,850
and went through all the ancient medical books

792
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,720
but couldn't find an answer.

793
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,920
Perhaps you were the little ears

794
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,600
sent by heaven to assist me.

795
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,860
It must be fate.

796
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:36,850
I think it's more like a predestined calamity.

797
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,400
But since you've already mastered

798
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,040
the divine skill of using eyes instead of ears,

799
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,430
why do you still need me to be your ears?

800
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,630
As the Young Lord

801
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,450
and the son of the monarch,

802
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,350
my every move

803
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,470
is watched by countless eyes.

804
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,460
If you can discover my secret,

805
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,820
how do you know others can't?

806
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,310
What can others do even if they know?

807
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,960
You're the Young Lord, after all.

808
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,430
Surely others won't laugh at you, will they?

809
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,660
You're so adorably naive.

810
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,790
Do you think those assassins

811
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,720
come to my mansion every day to admire the moonlight?

812
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,690
Although the mayors of each city respect my father,

813
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,240
he is now elderly.

814
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,340
They've all started speculating

815
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,480
about who will inherit the position of the monarch.

816
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,470
And as the monarch's only son,

817
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,560
I can't escape these disputes.

818
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,400
If some ill-intentioned people

819
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,930
find out about my deafness,

820
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,430
it could bring endless dangers and troubles.

821
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,350
So that's why he captured me and confined me,

822
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,900
forcing me to play music.

823
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,140
It was all because

824
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,600
he's been facing all of this alone all along.

825
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,870
If it were me,

826
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,590
I would be very scared and sad,

827
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,270
feeling helpless.

828
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,990
I could never handle it like he does.

829
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,010
Don't worry.

830
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,320
From now on, I'll be your ears.

831
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,930
If there's any danger,

832
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,910
I'll always be here.

00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,710
Wait a moment.

What secret codes?

Open it and take a look.

One gentle shake means safe.

843
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,370
One heavy shake and two light shakes mean that danger has been cleared.

844
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,170
That's right.

845

One heavy shake and one light shake mean danger is reduced.
