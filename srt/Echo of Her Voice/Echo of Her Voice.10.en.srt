You can use this as a place to stay

10

so you no longer need to wander around.

11
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,390
Also,

was for me to join Symphony Workshop

50

You're here.

They're all from

It's okay.

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,620
Take your time to pick and choose.

108
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,750
You'll surely find one you like.

109
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,190
You're right.

110
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,420

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,690
He really is a playboy.

You little devil.

Go on, Young Lord.

115
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,190
But lately, I've been considering

116
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,590
if I should settle down.

117
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,350
After all, some people say I'm flirtatious.

118
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,120
There are always some rumors.

119
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,690
But I've been thinking,

120
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,420
fate is all about timing.

121
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,940
In fact, I don't ask for much.

122
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,070
If someone...

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,550
someone's willing to make the first move

124
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,950
and confess their feelings first,

125
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,370
I could consider it.

126
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,310
That's right.

127
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,990
If someone hesitates to express their feelings

128
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,550
and misses their chance with you,

129
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,150
they might regret it forever.

130
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,330
Whoever confesses first gets accepted?

131
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,420
So casual about relationships.

132
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,250
Thank goodness I have a strong will.

133
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,850
I wasn't bewitched by you.

134
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,390
Go on, go on.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,820
This is really hard to choose.

136
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,910
Why don't you help me pick one?

137
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,270
Sure.

138
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,230
I'll help you choose.

139
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,970
Her then.

140
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,800
She's as beautiful as a fairy.

141
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,570
She's the most compatible with you.

142
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,290
Are you sure you're choosing her?

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,270
Yes, her.

144
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,350
Alright.

145
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,110
I need to go practice.

146
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,940
I'll take my leave.

147
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:01,930
Okay.

148
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,590
Why did she leave?

149
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,590
We're not done.

150
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,640
I knew

151
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,780
she'd definitely choose herself.

152
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,090
Xiaoqi, oh, Xiaoqi.

153
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,910
Don't you think my strategy

154
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,370
was brilliant?

155
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,200
Does this count as her admitting

156
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,470
she wants to be with me?

157
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,130
Young Lord.

158
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,070
I don't think Ms. Su looked at the painting.

159
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,990
She didn't?

160
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,070
How could she not have looked at it?

161
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,990
She just wanted to choose herself.

162
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,780
Yes, yes.

163
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,800
Young Lord.

164
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,150
Why don't we try the second plan?

165
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,600
Cater to her interests.

166
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,800
Alright, whatever you say.

167
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,620
So much delicious stuff.

168
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,720
Is it the little devil's...

169
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,280
Young Lord's birthday?

170
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,870
He said he's hosting a distinguished guest.

171
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,050
I heard it's a female guest.

172
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,110
A distinguished female guest?

173
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,610
Could it be the girl from the portrait this morning?

174
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,790
Ms. Su.

175
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,990
Don't touch them.

176
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,720
They're gifts

177
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,890
Young Lord prepared for the guest.

178
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,590
Don't mess things up.

179
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,270
Just look.

180
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,570
Don't touch them, okay?

181
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,170
Okay.

182
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,670
Dinner and gifts...

183
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,870
It's only their first meeting.

184
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,200
That little devil is really going all out.

185
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,510
What are you looking at?

186
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,950
Just looking around.

187
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,530
Young Lord.

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,640
Hosting a distinguished guest?

189
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,670
Is it the girl I chose from the portraits this morning?

190
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,460
That's right.

191
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,910
It's the girl you chose from the portraits.

192
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,960
You sure are generous.

193
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,470
Treating her to dinner and giving her all these gifts.

194
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,390
I've always been this way.

195
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,670
For any girl I like,

196
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,120
even if I've to empty my pockets,

197
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,580
I won't bat an eye.

198
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,130
Whatever wishes she has,

199
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,110
I'll help her make it come true.

200
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,360
She must've done a lot of good deeds in her past life

201
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,310
to be pampered by our Young Lord in this life.

202
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,700
One more thing.

203
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,360
I meet with that girl often.

204
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,610
So it's not your first time meeting?

205
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,480
No wonder.

206
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,730
Looks like she's this little devil's old flame.

207
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,750
In that case,

208
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,050
I won't disturb you two.

209
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,950
Enjoy your meal together.

210
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,180
I've just said so much.

211
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,730
Don't you want to get to know her better?

212
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,200
No thanks.

213
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,310
The portrait is so ugly.

214
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,230
Yuck.

215
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,290
I'll get going.

216
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,330
Wait...

217
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,750
Wait...

218
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,350
Wait...

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,030
Yuck?

220
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,790
Wait.

221
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,190
Was she doubting me

222
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,660
or doubting herself?

223
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,600
Testing the waters? Catering to her interests?

224
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,870
Listen.

225
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,530
Stop reading romance novels.

226
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,830
Young Lord.

227
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,510
I think they were still somewhat useful.

228
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,630
Oh, please.

229
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,750
Didn't you notice Ms. Su was jealous?

230
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,150
When she gets unbearably jealous,

231
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,960
she'll definitely confess to you.

232
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,670
Right!

233
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,860
Jealousy.

234
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,230
She was jealous just now.

235
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,840
I knew it.

236
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,550
How could anyone resist

237
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,630
my charm?

238
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,270
Exactly.

239
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,760
As expected, this little devil

240
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,240
is rotten.

241
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,670
Falling for every girl he sees.

242
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,750
To think I thought I liked him.

243
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,480
Those who like him are so unlucky.

244
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,070
Those he likes are even more unlucky.

245
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,830
I clearly don't like him,

246
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,950
so why's my heart in such turmoil?

247
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,760
Ms. Su.

248
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,940
Someone's here to see you.

249
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,080
Is it Young Lord?

250
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,460
No.

251
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,460
It's your sister.

252
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,120
My sister?

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,590
Ruoshan!

254
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,050
Ruoshan.

255
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,290
Didn't sleep well?

256
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,350
Come here.

257
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,270
Sit.

258
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,290
You must be thirsty. Have some tea.

259
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,520
Ruoshan.

260
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,270
Do you have someone you like?

261
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,550
Why do you ask?

262
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,310
Do you have someone you like?

263
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,710
I'm just asking.

264
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,070
What does it feel like to like someone?

265
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,220
Liking someone...

266
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,360
is like pursuing a goal you've always dreamed of.

267
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,070
You're always thinking about them.

268
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,750
When you close your eyes,

269
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,590
they seem to appear right in front of you.

270
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,950
You don't know why.

271
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,150
You think if you could have them,

272
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,790
your restless heart would be at peace.

273
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,470
Think about it.

274
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,010
Is there someone like that in your heart?

275
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,390
Why is it that when I think of him,

276
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,030
my heart feels all jumbled up?

277
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,750
Fei must be thinking about Young Lord.

278
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,350
Fei.

279
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,590
At your age,

280
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,470
it's normal to have crushes.

281
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,910
But promise me

282
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,170
you won't rush things.

283
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,470
Make sure he's a good person.

284
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,590
Got it?

285
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,030
Got it.

286
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,110
Thanks.

287
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,710
They said Young Lord isn't at the mansion.

288
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,640
I'll go back to Symphony Workshop.

289
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,750
When there's time, ask Young Lord

290
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,230
to bring you to see me there.

291
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,190
I'll be able to go there soon.

292
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,470
We have an agreement.

293
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,190
As long as I perform well,

294
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,810
he'll let me go to Symphony Workshop.

295
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,430
Did he really say that?

296
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,630
Then we sisters

297
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,710
can be together.

298
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,970
It'd be great if you join Symphony Workshop.

299
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,750
But aren't the registrations

300
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,910
already closed?

301
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,750
All the musicians have been evaluated

302
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,350
and assigned to their teams.

303
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,950
Didn't he tell you about this?

304
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,280
It's closed?

305
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,920
Take me there to check.

306
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,390
Maybe he registered me

307
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,240
and forgot to tell me.

308
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,790
Let's go.

309
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,030
Musician Su.

310
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,960
You must've made a mistake.

311
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,190
Your sister Su Ruofei isn't listed

312
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,790
on the Melodious group's registrations list.

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,830
She's not?

314
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,400
Impossible.

315
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,640
Please check again.

316
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:30,910
[Lyrical group]

317
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,510
It seems he has deceived you.

318
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,220
His feelings for you are just this shallow.

319
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,300
Nothing?

320
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,710
Anything?

321
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,480
There's the Melodious group, Lyrical group,

322
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,820
and Rhyming group.

323
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,310
She's not listed in any of them.

324
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,270
Thank you.

325
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,170
I'll take my leave.

326
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,710
How could this be?

327
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,150
Why am I not in there?

328
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,310
Why hasn't my music status been restored?

329
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,900
Perhaps Young Lord was busy with work

330
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,860
and forgot.

331
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,270
How could he forget?

332
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,950
He clearly promised me.

333
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,480
He's not keeping his word.

334
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,000
I've already agreed to his terms.

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,930
I've been working so hard as his...

336
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,860
As his what?

337
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,640
No way.

338
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,280
I've to clarify things.

339
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,880
Ruofei.

340
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,650
Shangyu?

341
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,760
Why are you here?

342
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm...

343
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,800
I brought her here.

344
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,400
She said Young Lord would help her join Symphony Workshop.

345
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,940
But we just checked the rosters,

346
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,140
and she's not on them.

347
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,760
So it's for this.

348
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,890
Let's go clarify it with Young Lord.

349
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,490
Come on.

350
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,310
Let's go.

351
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,820
No.

352
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,430
I need to talk to him about this alone.

353
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,610
Why?

354
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,750
I'll tell you another time.

355
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,690
I'll get going.

356
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,710
I must've been spoiling you.

357
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,910
You're getting so unruly.

358
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,070
Entering my study without permission

359
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,390
is a capital offense.

360
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,430
Watch my lips carefully.

361
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,390
Symphony Workshop's registrations have closed.

362
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,860
Why didn't you register me?

363
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,310
Why haven't you restored my music status

364
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,030
and let me join Symphony Workshop?

365
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,160
How did you find out?

366
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,670
Did Jin Shangyu tell you?

367
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,710
My sister told me.

368
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,590
If it weren't for her,

369
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,030
I'd still be in the dark.

370
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,830
We had a deal. I'll be your entertainer

371
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,710
and you'll restore my status

372
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,640
and let me join Symphony Workshop!

373
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,910
You've broken your promise.

374
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,300
I did say I'll help you join the workshop,

375
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,990
but I never said it'll be now.

376
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,670
If you want to perform for my mother,

377
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,390
I can take you into the palace anytime.

378
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,710
So you'd never

379
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,370
planned to register me at all!

380
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,530
Your primary task now

381
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,390
is to be my ears.

382
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,700
You're doing this on purpose.

383
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,710
Ears, huh?

384
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,430
Here.

385
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,270
If you take the wrist bells off,

386
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,140
the consequences will be drastic.

387
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,390
Then just kill me.

388
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,990
Kill me.

389
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,190
You'll never have ears again.

390
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,590
Don't worry.

391
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,670
I'll hold up

392
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,390
the end of my promise.

393
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,110
You just need to do your part,

394
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,730
and I'll take care of the rest.

395
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,630
Do you think I'd still believe you?

396
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,030
Do you have

397
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,540
any other choice?

398
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,210
Young Lord.

399
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,130
What's wrong with Ms. Su?

400
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,190
The little wildcat is angry.

401
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,250
But it's fine.

402
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,280
I was prepared for this.

403
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,110
Mother.

404
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,070
I'm here.

405
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,600
You're here.

406
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,640
You're editing scores again.

407
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,150
I wonder which musician's masterpiece

408
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,280
has caught your eye.

409
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,750
As the Young Lord,

410
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,190
how can you be so undignified?

411
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,600
You're in a haste.

412
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,070
What's the matter?

413
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,430
I just got a box of fine rouge.

414
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,760
I heard that these are made from

415
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,750
the Western Regions' exotic fragrance.

416
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,190
It's called Binding Charm.

417
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,590
A gift for my dear mother.

418
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,190
You're even

419
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,190
more particular than a woman.

420
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,990
Of course.

421
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,550
You're indescribably beautiful,

422
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,550
and I've inherited your good looks.

423
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,950
I must take good care of the looks

424
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,480
you've bestowed upon me.

425
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,880
Self care's a priority.

426
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,550
Save these sweet words

427
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,910
for the young ladies.

428
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,400
Tell me.

429
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,160
You're so attentive today.

430
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,590
What do you want?

431
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,120
I can't hide anything from you.

432
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,430
It's about that score

433
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,270
I asked you to transcribe.

434
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,350
Is it ready?

435
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,390
Long ago.

436
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,990
Mother.

437
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,590
You said we have a new musician at the mansion

438
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,430
who's talented and really admires me,

439
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,510
that you'd bring her to meet me someday.

440
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,630
You even requested for a score.

441
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,990
What?

442
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,100
Did she urge for the score?

443
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,830
No,

444
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,150
of course not.

445
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,310
I came just to see you.

446
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,110
I mentioned it in passing.

447
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,510
Take it.

448
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,940
Thank you, Mother.

449
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,670
Mu.

450
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,730
I know you like to have fun,

451
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,390
but you should settle down now.

452
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,870
Even your father thinks

453
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,510
you indulge in pleasure without ambition.

454
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,550
He wants to arrange a marriage for you.

455
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,890
An arranged marriage?

456
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,710
Mother, you must

457
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,990
stop Father for me.

458
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,390
I only want to

459
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,910
marry someone I like.

460
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,950
That way,

461
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,830
we can be like you and Father,

462
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,290
loving and harmonious.

463
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,430
Someone you like?

464
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,230
Is it Shan from Symphony Workshop?

465
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,430
I quite like her too.

466
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,460
Mother, you...

467
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,870
I just remembered I've something to deal with.

468
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,200
I'll visit another day.

469
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,510
I'll take my leave.

470
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,740
Mu...

471
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,110
You...

472
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,750
[Yongkang Palace]

473
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,390
Let's go, Xiaoqi.
[Yongkang Palace]

474
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,890
Back home.
[Yongkang Palace]

475
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:18,990
Back home.

476
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,070
What... what's this?

477
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,090
The score Su Ruofei wants.

478
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,910
What's wrong?

479
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,430
You said you'd wait for her to make the first move.

480
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,190
But look at this.

481
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,430
As soon as she got angry,

482
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,270
you rushed here to get her score.

483
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,380
Young Lord.

484
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,750
You've always been one to keep your cool.

485
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,270
But when it's about her...

486
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,910
Well,

487
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,280
I'm not in a hurry to appease her.

488
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,280
I didn't say you were in a hurry to appease her.

489
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,170
Young Lord.

490
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,270
Xiaoqi, don't overthink it.

491
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,430
In this matter,

492
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,750
I did do some things wrong.

493
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,910
So, this score

494
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,710
is to compensate for it.

495
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,970
And Xiaoqi,

496
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,550
stop trying to guess my thoughts again.

497
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,750
[Yongkang Palace]

498
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,010
You are the Young Lord.
[Yongkang Palace]

499
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,390
[Yongkang Palace]

500
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,670
Whatever you say goes.

501
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,590
Selfish.

502
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,060
Untrustworthy.

503
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,310
I must've been out of my mind.

504
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,000
To think I thought I fell for someone like you.

505
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,730
It seems Young Lord

506
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,160
didn't give you a satisfactory answer.

507
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,340
Shangyu.

508
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,640
This little devil was really deceiving me.

509
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,270
He never registered me.

510
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,200
He just wants to keep me by his side.

511
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,260
I fell right into his trap.

512
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,750
Since he doesn't want you to join Symphony Workshop,

513
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,470
there's no point in staying here.

514
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,470
Want to return to Cloud City with me?

515
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,230
No.

516
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,870
You're in charge of Symphony Workshop now.

517
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,360
Your future is bright.

518
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,080
How could you go back with me?

519
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,890
Are you silly?

520
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,350
I went back to Cloud City to find you.

521
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,070
I agreed to oversee Symphony Workshop

522
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,070
for your sake too.

523
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,160
Have I ever

524
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,690
cared about fame and glory?

525
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,470
Shangyu.

526
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,030
You're so nice.

527
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,200
Thank you.

528
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,550
It's what I should do.

529
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,550
After all, I'm...

530
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,970
I'm your good buddy, aren't I?

531
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,160
Good buddies stick together through thick and thin.

532
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,150
No.

533
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,110
If I just go back like this,

534
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,770
I'd be letting that little devil off too easily.

535
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,060
What do you want to do?

536
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,630
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

537
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,920
I must find a chance

538
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,150
to vent my anger on him.

539
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,670
Okay.

540
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,870
If you need me,

541
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,710
just let me know.

542
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,930
He's the Young Lord,

543
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,100
but I'm not afraid of him.

544
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,860
Don't worry.

545
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,020
When I need you,

546
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,360
I'll come to you.

547
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
Alright, Ruofei.

548
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,020
You can see me off here.

549
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,790
Okay.

550
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,160
I'll go in then.

551
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,010
She thought she fell for him?

552
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,820
So she really had feelings for Yun Mu.

553
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,510
Mr. Jin.

554
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,190
What a rare guest.

555
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,170
Greetings, Young Lord.

556
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,790
I suppose you're here to see me.

557
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,110
I was here for Ruofei.

558
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,820
Bye.

559
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,030
Mr. Jin, you're so openly

560
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,590
frequenting my mansion

561
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,470
to see my entertainer.

562
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,110
Isn't it inappropriate?

563
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,960
Young Lord, those words

564
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,960
don't quite make sense, do they?

565
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,080
Anyway, Ruofei was first my childhood friend

566
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,840
and then your entertainer.

567
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,570
We have a deeper bond to begin with.

568
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,470
Also,

569
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,950
I came today

570
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,670
because

571
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,790
I heard Ruofei failed to join Symphony Workshop.

572
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,990
I came to comfort her.

573
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,390
I really don't get it.

574
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,090
You're known for cherishing talent.

575
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,550
You clearly know

576
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,950
Ruofei's exceptionally talented in music

577
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,670
and practices diligently,

578
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,670
but you insist on confining her here

579
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,030
and not letting her join Symphony Workshop.

580
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,630
It's both a waste of her talents

581
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,920
and damaging to your virtue.

582
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,270
You're too selfish.

583
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,000
How dare you!

584
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,330
Watch your words with Young Lord!

585
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,670
Mr. Jin spoke frankly for a friend.

586
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,030
I admire that.

587
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,470
But don't forget,

588
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,310
Su Ruofei is a member of my mansion.

589
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,470
There's no need for outsiders to worry about her.

590
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,530
It's getting late.

591
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,430
Xiaoqi,

592
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,630
see the guest out.

593
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,150
Yes.

594
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,030
Oh, right.

595
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,150
Replace today's gate guards

596
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,710
with more diligent ones.

597
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,130
My mansion is

598
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,350
not open to just anyone.

599
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,580
I've just one more thing to say.

600
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,470
If Ruofei wishes,

601
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,510
I'll use any means necessary

602
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,440
to get her into Symphony Workshop.

603
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,780
Mr. Jin, please leave.

604
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,830
Treacherous.

605
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,620
Shameless.

606
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,150
Obnoxious bully.

607
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,200
Breaking promises.

608
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,960
Young Lord.

609
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,230
Mr. Jin said

610
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,880
that this time, he'll figure out how

611
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,810
to get her into Symphony Workshop.

612
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,130
Did he really say that?

613
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,380
Then I really can't let her join Symphony Workshop.

614
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,270
Despicable.

615
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,470
Perverse.

616
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,990
Treacherous.

617
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,420
Shameless.

618
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,460
Young Lord.

619
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,010
She isn't throwing tantrums this time.

620
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,630
She's practicing hard even when you're not in.

621
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,090
Your kindness towards her

622
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,040
was worth it.

623
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,350
She sure is practicing hard.

624
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,350
[Open and Aboveboard]

625
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,720
Greetings, Young Lord.
[Open and Aboveboard]

626
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:06,910
Greetings, Young Lord.

627
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,710
Practicing?

628
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,840
Young Lord.

629
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,680
You heard everything just now?

630
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,950
I did.

631
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,440
You practiced well.

632
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,030
I'm glad you like it.

633
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,030
Let me practice another one for you.

634
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,630
Shameless.

635
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,430
Obnoxious bully.

636
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,270
Breaking promises.

637
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Wolf in sheep's clothing.

638
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,880
How's that? Satisfied?

639
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,960
Very satisfied.

640
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,310
That's good.

641
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,860
It's time for my break again.

642
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,040
I should go rest.

643
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,410
Farewell.

644
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,650
[Open and Aboveboard]
Farewell.

645
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,710
[Open and Aboveboard]

646
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,630
Despicable. Perverse.
[Open and Aboveboard]

647
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,550
Treacherous. Shameless.
[Open and Aboveboard]

650
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:55,890
Wolf in sheep's clothing.

651
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,060
Young Lord.

652
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,990
What is she practicing?

653
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,100
What did all that ringing mean?

654
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,510
Curious?

655
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,970
Shameless! Despicable!

656
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,460
Wolf in sheep's clothing!

657
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,570
Hey.

658
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,000
Why are you insulting me?

659
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,310
You wanted to hear it.

660
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,250
[Open and Aboveboard]

661
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,580
How dare she insult you?

[Open and Aboveboard]

663
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,630
No. I'll go discipline her now.
[Open and Aboveboard]

[Open and Aboveboard]

665
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,350
Let her vent if she wants to.

666
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:30,970
Forget it.

667
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,010
Young Lord.

668
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
You're really spoiling her.

669
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,620
The woman I like

670
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,550
deserves to be spoiled.

671
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,870
[Open and Aboveboard]

672
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,650
Young Lord.

[Open and Aboveboard]

674
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,050
Cloud City's mayor is here.
[Open and Aboveboard]

675
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,380
Cloud City's mayor is here.

676
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,060
What an eventful day.

677
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,710
One guest after another.

678
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,230
Let's go.

679
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,310
Meet Uncle.

680
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,030
[Inspired Paradise]

681
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,630
Uncle.
[Inspired Paradise]

682
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,510
[Inspired Paradise]

683
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,670
What important matter brought you here?
[Inspired Paradise]

684
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,430
Come, sit, sit.
[Inspired Paradise]

685
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,950
Okay.
[Inspired Paradise]

686
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,090
[Inspired Paradise]

687
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,030
Tomorrow is Symphony Workshop's centennial celebration.

688
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,750
Your father wants us to attend as representatives.

689
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,750
You know me.

690
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm fearless on the battlefield.

691
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,780
But this...

692
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,470
Speaking in front of so many people

693
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,870
is quite nerve-racking.

694
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:14,750
So,

695
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,470
I'll leave the fancy speeches

696
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,390
to you.

697
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,590
Sure.

698
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,030
I'll do as you say.

699
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,390
Full cooperation.

700
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,070
Good.

701
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,510
Then it's settled.

702
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,070
But tomorrow...

703
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,700
For tomorrow,

704
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,080
I've made Shanshan the lead musician.

705
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,190
In front of Shanshan,

706
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,610
I must be the most impressive person.

707
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,880
Do you get what I mean?

708
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,550
The most impressive person.

709
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,870
Of course, I get it.

710
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,880
Good that you do.

711
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,550
Alright.

712
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,670
That's all for now.

713
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,030
I need to go see Shanshan at Symphony Workshop.

714
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,100
-I’m leaving.
-Okay.

715
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,100
Take care, Uncle.

716
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,750
Haitang.

717
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,680
See my uncle out.

718
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,350
Yes.

719
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,750
For tomorrow's centennial celebration,

720
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,950
you and Su Ruofei will accompany me.

721
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,200
Are you sure you want her to go with you?

722
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,350
I've been training her for so long.

723
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,310
It's for her to be useful

724
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,430
in such occasions.

725
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,990
She was just

726
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,570
venting with her insults.

727
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,870
I've seen how she has

728
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,030
defended me before.

729
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,910
I believe she'll do very well this time.

730
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,790
Don't worry, Young Lord.

731
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,720
I'll complete the task

732
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,910
you've assigned me well.

733
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,820
I'll never embarrass you.

734
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,150
Don't worry.

735
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,790
I've always been fair in rewards and punishments.

736
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,440
If you do well tomorrow,

737
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,030
I'll give you a big surprise.

738
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,010
Thank you, Young Lord.

739
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,690
Not letting me join Symphony Workshop is one thing,

740
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,990
but even making me accompany you

741
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,850
for the centennial celebration?

742
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,870
I'll show you

743
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,270
what a real surprise is.

744
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,960
Come, take a look.

745
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,080
Do you like them?

746
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,990
You recommended me

747
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,910
as the lead musician to Music Minister Ling

748
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,590
so I can lead the celebratory performance.

749
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,050
I'm already deeply moved.

750
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,470
And these gifts from you

751
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,670
are far too precious.

752
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,690
Forgive me for not daring to accept them.

753
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,200
Don't get formal with me again.

754
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,430
If it's for you,

755
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,250
there's no price I wouldn't pay.

756
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,980
I want you to be the most dazzling one

757
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,710
at tomorrow's ceremony.

758
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,230
Then I'll humbly accept.

759
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,830
Thank you, Mayor.

760
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,870
Try them on now.

761
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,670
See if they fit.

762
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,130
I'll wait for you outside.

763
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,180
You look so beautiful now.

764
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,950
Tomorrow, you'll surely be the most eye-catching one

765
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,810
in the entire Symphony Workshop.

766
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,170
But only I know

767
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,310
how hard-earned all of this is.

768
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,290
Whether it's Su Ruofei, the uncle, or the nephew,

769
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,060
their glory is all inherited.

770
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,220
They'd never experience

771
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,130
the hardships we've endured in their lifetime.

772
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,920
What they're giving you now

773
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,350
is nothing but th heavens'

774
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,470
belated compensation and pity.

775
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,870
You deserve it.

776
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,350
But remember,

777
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,000
this is far from enough.

778
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,550
We must strive to climb higher.

779
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,580
We deserve even better.

780
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,900
And they

781
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,630
are nothing but stepping stones beneath our feet.

782
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
We must climb to the very top.

783
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,000
And I...

784
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,430
must become the music minister.

785
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,150
No,

786
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,230
not just the music minister.

787
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,910
Also the future wife of His Majesty.

788
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,940
His Majesty's wife?

789
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:23,910
Shanshan.

790
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,390
Are you done?

791
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,310
Yes, Mayor.

792
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,250
Please come in.

793
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,350
Shanshan.

794
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,130
You look so beautiful.

795
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,030
I owe it to your good taste.

[Pleasing to the Ears]

798
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,220
I, Su Ruoshan, and Shouyang musicians would like to

799
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,730
pay our respects to Cloud City's Mayor, Young Lord,

800
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,700
Lord Liang, Music Minister Ling,

801
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,820
and Mr. Jin.

802
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,670
Musician Su, please rise.

803
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,200
Sister!

804
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,100
It's time!

805
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,550
Let the centennial celebration begin!

806
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,870
Uncle, please.

807
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,960
Okay.

808
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,550
Music!

809
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,170
This melody should only exist in heaven.

810
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,830
It's rare to hear it in the mortal world.

811
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,710
Shanshan's harp playing

812
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,980
brings joy to the heart.

813
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,900
My sister's harp skills

814
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,860
bring honor to Cloud City.

815
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,400
Well said.

816
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,420
[Pleasing to the Ears]
Well said.

00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,850
It indeed brings honor to our Cloud City.

[Pleasing to the Ears]

820
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,590
You really have a way with words.

821
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,590
No wonder our Mu

822
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,250
takes you everywhere he goes.

823
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,670
Ms. Su's musical artistry is moving.

824
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,710
I was just entranced by it.

825
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,070
I didn't hear what you just said.

826
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,800
I said Shanshan plays the harp well.

827
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,420
Naturally.

828
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,750
Ms. Su's harp skills

829
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,890
are unparalleled.

[Pleasing to the Ears]

831
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,470
Uncle was just talking to me.

832
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,330
Why didn't you relay the message?

833
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,910
He was just praising me.

834
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,070
I didn't want to sound boastful.

835
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,750
So I didn't pass it on.

836
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,280
Remember your duty today.

837
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,590
If there's any news later,

838
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,270
relay it to me accurately.

839
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,610
Got it.

840
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,160
What's with the temper?

841
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,590
If it weren't for you,

842
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:19,980
I'd be

843
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,830
one of the musicians by now.

844
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,590
You upset me first.

845
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,280
I'll have to find a chance to tease you back

846
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,430
and embarrass you.

860
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,660
The person I'm about to solemnly invite

861
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,710
can be described as Dongsheng continent's

862
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,440
jade pillar supporting the sky

863
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,590
and golden beam across the sea.

864
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,910
This emcee is phenomenal

865
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,020
at bootlicking.

866
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,740
But the mayor does deserve it.

867
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,590
Unlike this little devil,

868
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,910
who has nothing going for him

869
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,190
except his good looks.

870
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,950
He's not only highly respected

871
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,310
but has also contributed...

872
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,510
Get ready to stand up.

873
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,370
To the stability and prosperity of Dongsheng.

874
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,130
Stand up.

875
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,010
Has the program been changed?

876
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,430
Uncle didn't inform me.

877
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,960
He's deeply loved by the people of Dongsheng.

878
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,910
So it's been changed.

879
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,790
Let's welcome Yun...

00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,070
No, wait.

882
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,990
Don't take it. Don't take it.

883
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,290
Young Lord.

884
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,750
Did you all think

885
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,000
I'd strike the gong?

886
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,630
Striking the gong is the most important part

887
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,150
of this celebration.

888
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,710
The only one for this task

889
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,190
is my most respected uncle,

890
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,790
that is, the mayor of Cloud City.

891
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,790
But how could my uncle

892
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,910
be so casually

893
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,240
invited onto the stage?

894
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,390
[Pleasing to the Ears]

895
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,120
Only if I personally invite him

00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,150
[Pleasing to the Ears]

897
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,800
will it seem more solemn.

Uncle, please.

900
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,890
I was just trying to liven up the atmosphere.

901
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,790
You won't blame me, will you?

902
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,150
Of course I won't blame you.

903
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,620
But in such occasions in the future,

904
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,550
you really shouldn't joke around.

905
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,310
I'll heed your advice.

906
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,370
I won't do it again.

907
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,050
Please.

908
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,230

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,470
-Bravo!
