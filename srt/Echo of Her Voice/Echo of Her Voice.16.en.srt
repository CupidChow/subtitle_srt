00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,220
Inform the others not to wander around.

191
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,520
Be on standby at any time.

192
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,140
Yes.

Ruofei!

198

Uncle?

199
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,480
Xiaoqi!

200
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,320
Xiaoqi's been poisoned and is in a coma because of you.

201
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,450
Have you forgotten?

202
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,970
You hurt him.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,530
You're the one who hurt him.

204
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,470
If he weren't protecting you,

205
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,560
he wouldn't be poisoned.

206
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,080

Are you using a woman

to threaten me?

212
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,350
Using her?

213

Haven't you been using her all along?

Why are you here?

228
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,310
Did you tell them

229
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,040
I borrowed the lamp oil for you?

230
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,260
What are you talking about?

231
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,450
When did I ask you to borrow it for me?

232
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,070
Then why am I released?

233
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,030
His Majesty has agreed

234
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,150
to release you,

235
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,210
but you'll be expelled from Symphony Workshop

236
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,270
and banished from Symphony City.

237
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,860
Why does he want to expel me?

238
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,780
Setting fire to the workshop is a serious crime.

239
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,710
Count yourself lucky that

240
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,200
it's just expulsion.

241
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,000
It's just the two of us here.

242
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,510
Why are you lying?

243
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,750
Why are you doing this?

244
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,190
I want to know why too.

245
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,080
Why did you choose to stay in Symphony City?

246
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,490
If you were in Cloud City,

247
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,670
none of this would've happened.

248
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,750
We'd still be good sisters.

249
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,950
When I become the music minister,

250
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,950
I'll bring you and our parents over.

251
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,100
We'll keep living happily together.

252
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,100
I also want to be the music minister.

253
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,900
You know what?

254
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,390
I've also thought about

255
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,160
what it'd be like if we competed

256
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,290
against each other.

257
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,760
I thought that no matter who won,

258
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,320
we'd be happy for the other.

259
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,470
But now...

260
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,390
I was wrong.

261
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,450
Of course you were.

262
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,950
Why else would you be here?

263
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,340
The music minister position will be mine alone.

264
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh, right.

265
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,700
Not just the position.

266
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,220
Young Lord will be mine too.

267
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,310
Alright.

268
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,480
I have things to attend to.

269
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,750
I've to go.

270
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,770
Young Lord?

271
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,050

272
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,750

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,450
Have you found evidence to prove my innocence?

276
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,750
Not yet.

277
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,350
His Majesty wants to banish me from Symphony City.

278
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,320
Do you know that?

279
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,680
I know.

280
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,390
But you know I didn't do it.

281
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,060
I...

282
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,400
All the evidence now

283
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,710
points to you as the culprit.

284
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
His Majesty only looks at evidence.

285
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,520
Because my sister is lying.

286
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,970
Right.

287
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,310
You and my sister have been betrothed.

288
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,700
So you want me out of Symphony City

289
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,310
just so you can be with her.

290
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,390
You promised me

291
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,630
you'd handle your relationship with her.

292
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,070
Is this your final answer to me?

293
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,130
Things aren't as simple as you think.

294
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,090
I still have to do what I need to do.

295
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,340
Your departure...

296
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,870
is the best choice.

297
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,810
My departure?

298
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,580
For you, my departure from Symphony City...

299
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,160
is the best choice?

300
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,350
Yes.

301
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,740
Fine.

Even if you and my sister are betrothed...

303
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,270
I must prove my innocence

304
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,380
before leaving.

305
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,470
I must explain it

309
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,270
Let go of me!

310
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,530
He won't believe you!

311
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,000

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,430
The workshop arson

377
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,920
is damaging to Dongsheng's reputation.

378
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,040
His Majesty wants to suppress this matter as soon as possible.

379
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,580
Now all the evidence points to you.

380
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,880
There's no other way.

381
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,170
He can only make you leave.

382
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,050
Ruofei.

383
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,260
I'm of no help.

385
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,760
You've already helped me a lot.

386
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,070
Thank you.

387
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,670
Then I'll just

388
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,760
return to Cloud City.

389
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,370
Eleven,

390
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,840
Biao,

391
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,590
and Monkey are waiting for me.

392
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Symphony Workshop doesn't want me,

393
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,230
but I still have Green Flash Workshop.

394
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,260
Okay.

395
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,020
Let's get some food first.

396
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,960
We'll return to Cloud City tomorrow morning.

397
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,820
We?

398
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,260
I've bid my farewell to His Majesty.

399
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,510
I came here because of you.

400
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,760
Now that you're leaving,

401
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
there's no point in staying.

402
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,420
Wherever Jin goes, I go.

403
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,820
If Jin is going to Cloud City,

404
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,690
I'm going too.

405
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,460
Thank you.

406
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,140
Alright.

407
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,270
Cheer up.

408
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,970
Let's get some yummy food.

409
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,350
I'm so hungry.

410
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,030
Let's go.

411
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,660
Mayor.

412
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,690
How are the preparations?

413
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,890
Everything is ready.

414
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,440
But I believe

415
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,730
this operation is still a bit hasty.

416
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,390
Yun Mu must be extremely guarded against us.

417
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,390
Maybe this time,

418
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,250
it's a trap to lure us in,

419
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,360
waiting for us to take the bait.

420
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,970
Mayor.

421
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,360
Please reconsider.

422
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,930
Didn't you say Xiaoqi was poisoned

423
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,390
and has been unconscious?

424
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,710
Yes.

425
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,120
And I heard from Jin

426
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,550
there's a banquet today.

427
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,010
Everyone in their mansion is drinking,

428
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,940
even the guards.

429
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,980
It's the perfect opportunity!

430
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,200
This banquet is what's most suspicious.

431
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,930
What's so suspicious about it?

432
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,810
I think Yun Mu's scared you

433
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,270
because you failed twice.

434
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,150
Yun Mu

435
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,050
has already bullied my Shanshan.

436
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,710
And I heard

437
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,050
my elder brother has driven

438
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,780
Su Ruofei out of Symphony City.

439
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,270
It's paving the way

440
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,070
for marrying Shanshan to Yun Mu.

441
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,130
If I wait any more,

442
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,060
I'd have to watch them get married!

443
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,440
I understand.

444
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,530
Go quickly!

445
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,970
[Young Lord's Mansion]

446
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,050
Come on!

447
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,150
Another one.

448
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,550
Fill it up!

449
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,280
Here!

450
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,940
Why did you drink so much?

451
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,000
Will she be okay?

452
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,910
Huang Ying.

453
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,170
I'm fine.

454
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,470
Come on.

455
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,270
Let's keep drinking.

456
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,560
Drink...

457
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,920
-Enough. Give it to me.
-Drink up.

458
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,690
Stop drinking.

459
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,150
Give it!

460
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,710
No!

461
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,800
-Give it to me.
-Candied haws!

462
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,200
Candied haws!

463
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,540
Candied haws...

464
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,500
Candied haws...

465
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
You want some?

466
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,390
Yes.

467
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,750
Why are you laughing?

468
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,180
He still says he doesn't like me.

469
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,670
Liar.

470
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,040
Fill it up!

471
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,420
Go!

472
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,670
Okay, okay.

473
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,190
-Stop drinking.
-Jin Shangyu!

474
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:48,820
Gentlemen.

475
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,190
You like me! You like me!

476
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,070
Okay, okay.

477
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,990
He likes you. He likes you.

478
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,910
Let's sit.

479
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,230
Come on.

480
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,510
He likes me.

481
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,150
He likes me.

482
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,670
Have you heard?

483
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,630
Young Lord's Mansion was just attacked by assassins.

484
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,160
They're searching the city for accomplices.

485
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,990
Young Lord's Mansion is heavily guarded.

486
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,790
These assassins

487
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,710
were just throwing eggs at a wall.

488
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,440
You're wrong.

489
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,410
I heard these assassins were all well-trained.

490
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,530
Quite a few died.

491
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,460
Excuse me.

492
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,570
Is Young Lord okay?

493
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,270
Yeah.

494
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,470
I heard he was injured.

495
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,140
Waiter!

496
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,280
Waiter!

497
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,970
Yes, ma'am!

498
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,280
Quiet down.

499
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,460
Can you look after her?

500
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,270
I'll be right back.

501
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,400
Where are you going?

502
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,550
Be good.

503
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,750
Be good.

504
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,940
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

505
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,540
How was it?
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

506
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:44,570
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

507
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,190
Mayor.
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

508
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

509
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,850
Did we succeed?
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

510
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,060
Did we succeed?

511
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Where's Huang Fu?

512
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,800
General Huang is dead.

513
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,350
Dead?

514
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,120
Impossible.

515
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,450
How could that old fox die?

516
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,710
Investigate again.

517
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,700
Tell him to come see me!

518
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,850
There's no mistake.

519
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,070
He fell into Yun Mu's ambush.

520
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,470
They've been... completely wiped out.

521
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,660
Huang Fu?

522
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,280
I didn't expect...

523
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,070
you were faking your coma.

524
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,940
Of course.

525
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,110
Having to lie in bed all day

526
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,950
without moving

527
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,150
and drinking such bitter medicine.

528
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,220
It was suffocating!

529
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,080
General Huang.

530
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,850
Long time no see.

531
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,620
To think you'd personally act as bait

532
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,170
to lure me in.

533
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm truly flattered.

534
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,420
You think you can capture me alive?

535
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,170
Dream on!

536
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,930
Phosphorus fire pill?

537
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,080
Young Lord.

538
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,150
Our...

539
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,400
evidence has died.

540
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,380
To think Huang Fu

541
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,990
would go to such lengths

542
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,070
for Yun Shang.

543
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,680
So they never

544
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,310
planned on returning alive.

545
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,260
They were determined to protect him at all costs.

546
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,250
No way.

547
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,610
No. No way.

548
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,580
Impossible!

549
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,350
Yun Mu's lot must be

550
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,420
spreading fake news.

551
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,280
Go find him now.

552
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,380
I must see him dead or alive!

553
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,390
Go find him now!

554
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,100
Mayor.

555
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't think you can see him.

556
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
He went with phosphorus fire pills.

557
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,290
His body has become nothing but a pile...

558
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,330
a pile of charred remains.

559
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,300
What?

560
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,450
Self-immolation?

561
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,850
Before General Huang left,

562
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,510
he specifically told me

563
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,480
that this mission was extremely dangerous.

564
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,640
He told me

565
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,440
if anything were to happen,

566
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,720
he'd find a way to keep you safe.

567
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,460
He also instructed me

568
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,550
to stay by your side

569
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,480
to protect you from now on.

570
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,020
But I never imagined

571
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,720
that the way he spoke of... would be so brutal.

572
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,740
So...

573
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,510
So from the very start,

574
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,750
he knew he... wouldn't return.

575
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,630
I forced him to go.

576
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,860
I must avenge him!

577
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,520
Mayor!

578
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:54,800
Let go!

579
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:54,910
[Assert Your Power With Courage]
Let go!

580
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,790
Mayor, you mustn't!
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

581
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,390
Let go!
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

582
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:56,430
-If you go now...
-Let go of me!
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

583
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,550
-If you go now...
-Let go of me!

584
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,210
His sacrifice will be in vain!

585
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,770
He always hoped you'd come to your senses

586
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,470
and not be blinded by romantic feelings

587
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,930
anymore!

588
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,130
Don't you get it by now?

589
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,950
Mayor!

590
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,310
[Assert Your Power With Courage]

591
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,700
[Young Lord's Mansion]

592
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,990
Let me in!

593
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,970
Xiaoqi!

594
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,260
Let her go.

595
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,070
Xiaoqi!

596
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,290
Is Young Lord okay?

597
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,360
Is he badly hurt?

598
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,710
He still has important matters to attend to.

599
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,110
Wait for him in the study.

600
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,110
Okay.

601
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,070
Here are your candied haws!

602
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,120
You're back, sir.

603
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,930
Waiter.

604
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,920
Where is she?

605
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,170
She left in a hurry.

606
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,420
It seemed urgent.

607
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,350
She's gone?

608
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,640
Where to?

609
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,820
She didn't say.

610
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,350
Sir.

611
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,570
I'll get back to work.

612
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,240
This...

613
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,510
How did it end up here?

614
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,490
Why are you here?

615
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,980
Are you okay?

616
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,230
I'm fine.

617
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,840
I...

618
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,220
How did my jasper end up here?

619
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,110
Did your men who

620
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,810
sealed my workshop take it?

621
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,710
Your jasper?

622
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,680
I've nurtured this jasper for years.

623
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,760
Wait.

624
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,910
How do you know it's called jasper?

625
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
Did your sister tell you?

626
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,060
My sister?

627
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,610
Wait.

628
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,880
This jasper is mine.

629
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,480
I even named it.

630
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,300
Are you better?

631
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,270
Much better.

632
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,430
Is this the legendary green flash?

633
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,310
Green flash?

634
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,690
What is this?

635
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,530
It's so beautiful.

636
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,930
I've never seen it before too.

637
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,230
It looks like a piece of jade.

638
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,390
It is soft.

639
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,090
Let's...

640
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,990
call it jasper.

641
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,500
What?

642
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,640
Jasper.

643
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,250
Jasper?

644
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,280
Nice name.

645
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,930
What's wrong?

646
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,820
Nothing.

647
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,430
There's buzzing in my ears.

648
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,630
I can't hear clearly.

649
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,420
I'm about to leave Cloud City.

650
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,400
Since we both discovered this jasper,

651
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,290
why don't we split it?

652
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,700
When I come back,

653
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,450
we can use it to find each other.

654
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,480
Okay.

655
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,860
Here, take it.

656
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,750
This isn't fair.

657
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,640
I want the bigger half.

658
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,360
How is it unfair?

659
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,240
If it's up to you,

660
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,410
which one would you take?

661
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,160
I'm not like you.

662
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,380
I'd take the smaller piece.

663
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,740
That's right.

664
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,870
As you wish.

665
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,810
You're welcome.

666
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,510
Stingy!

667
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,890
You're so cunning!

668
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,070
I want the bigger half!

669
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,030
You said you wanted the small one.

670
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,240
Come and get it! Come on!

671
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,510
Give it back to me.

672
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,350
Stingy!

673
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,840
Give it back!

674
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,810
Give it back to me! Give it!

675
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,590
Give it back to me!

676
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,400
It's the bigger piece.

677
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,440
So...

678
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,220
That stingy boy back then...

679
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,710
was actually you?

680
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,380
You mean...

681
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,660
You named it jasper?

682
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,140
So you are...
