Xiaoqi.

5
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,340
Young Lord, what’s wrong?

6
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,540
Is there an assassin?

7
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,350
Go ask her

8
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,880
is she going to sleep or not?

9
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,610
She's been disturbing me all night. I can't rest.

10
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,720
Why are you still standing there?

11
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,430
Go quickly!

12
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,930
Ms. Su,

13
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,510
the Young Lord asks if you're going to sleep.

14
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,660
Tell him that

15
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,190
he's the one tossing and turning.

16
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,850
He's making so much noise I can't sleep.

17
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,910
Tell him to stop being unerasonable.

18
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,810
She says you're being unreasonable.

19
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,260
I'm unreasonable?

20
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,990
I sent you to Symphony Workshop

21
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,430
to be a musician,

22
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,110
not to reminisce with Jin Shangyu,

23
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,950
causing controversy

24
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,410
and affecting the reputation of my mansion.

25
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,110
Go.

26
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,190
The Young Lord said—

27
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,090
He shouldn't say anything.

28
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,400
As the Young Lord,

29
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,390
he's actually joining those people in making groundless accusations.

30
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,080
Shangyu and I are buddies

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,990
who grew up together since childhood.

32
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,230
Certain people don't believe me

33
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,050
and are even spreading rumors over there.

34
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,610
Go.

35
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm spreading rumors?

36
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,030
To make a groundless accusation, there must be something to accuse.

37
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,750
Without that,

38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,230
others can't make accusations even if they want.

39
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,870
Moreover,

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,400
you went to practice with Jin Shangyu

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,330
and you two were all touchy-feely.

42
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,190
If that's not grounds for accusations, what is it?

43
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,710
Go.

44
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,190
You are

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,750
seriously so petty.

46
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,550
What is she doing over there?

47
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,630
She said...

48
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,670
Said what?

49
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,590
You're seriously so petty.

50
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,070
You dare to insult me?

51
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,510
I didn't insult you.

52
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,790
Then who insulted me?

53
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,270
I insulted you.

54
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000

Oh, right.

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,580
Doesn't he have a sweetheart?

58
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll show her portrait to my sister.

59
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,390
Let her see this little devil's true colors.

60
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,470
It's her.

61
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,540
The little devil even said I know her.

62
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,150
She does look familiar.

63
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,800
This—

64
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,110
This is too familiar.

65
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,860
It can't be me, can it?

66
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,010
The little devil actually likes me?

67
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,540
It can't be.

68
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,560
This is definitely a trap.

I'm not following you.

It's so pretty.

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,710
I think yours is pretty.

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,990
Look, it's purple.

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,030

Go ahead.

91
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,550

I just saw it.

95
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,480
I was going to ask you about it.

he likes.

101

These girls heard what he said.

102
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,250
That's why they dressed up like this.

103
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,230
So, Mr. Jin is the one you have feelings for.

104
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,900
How is that possible?

105
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,640

who is it that you have feelings for?

It's...

110
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,110
Alright.

111
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,070
You won't even tell your sister the truth.

112
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,110
Yesterday, Mr. Jin

113
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,720
gave such obvious hints in public,

114
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
yet you still want to deny it.

115
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,380
Ruoshan,

116
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,190
maybe Shangyu was just saying that casually,

117
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,120
while those people took it seriously.

118
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,180
Alright, alright.

119
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,630
I know you're shy.

120
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,710
But even if you don't like him,

121
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,270
how do you know Mr. Jin doesn't like you?

122
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,530
I've said all I need to say.

123
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,800
You should think about it carefully.

124
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:22,990
By the way,

125
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,820
do you want to participate in the musician audition

126
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,010
for the ceremony?

127
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,110
Of course I want to participate.

128
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,640
Although I might not be able to beat you,

129
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,190
even if I lose,

130
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,850
it's still a rare opportunity for me to improve.

131
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,030
Good.

132
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,830
I also look forward to competing with you on the same stage.

133
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,630
This is a rare opportunity.

134
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,590
The Symphony Workshop is full of talented people.

135
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,600
Don't slack off.

136
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,430
Don't worry.

137
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,830
I won't let you down.

138
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,740
I'm going to practice now.

139
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,070
Go ahead.

140
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm off to practice.

141
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,450
Young Lord,

142
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,800
I just asked Fei specifically.

143
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,800
Fei...

144
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,670
indeed has feelings for Master Jin.

145
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,070
Although this girl doesn't truly understand it,

146
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,190
her feelings

147
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,620
can't be hidden.

148
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,840
Ruoshan, thank you.

149
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,110
I'll head off now.

150
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,800
Now that the seed of suspicion has been planted,

151
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,750
I'll just wait for it to take root and bear fruit.

152
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,990
Only by making the Young Lord completely give up on Fei

153
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,750
will I have a chance to get him back in my grasp.

154
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,700
This is so annoying.

155
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,630
They locked me up for so long.

156
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,350
I wonder if my Jin misses me.

157
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,970
Why are they copying Su Ruofei?

158
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,880
What are they...

159
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,170
What's going on with them?

160
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,160
Have you all gone crazy?

161
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm not too sure about the details.

162
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,500
I heard it's because yesterday, Master Jin

163
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,100
publicly described what kind of girl he likes.

164
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,430
Shangyu likes me?

165
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,270
How is that possible?

166
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,190
Ruoshan must be overthinking it.

167
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,950
But those musicians' outfits...

168
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,050
In terms of looks and ability,

169
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,040
where exactly did I fall short?

170
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,930
Huang Ying.

171
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,790
You're back.

172
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,920
How did it go?

173
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,870
It's fine now.

174
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,220
The timbre of your drum is quite good.

175
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,100
May I try it?

176
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,070
This is my favorite drum.

177
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,630
The timbre is indeed quite good.

178
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,810
Huang Ying!

179
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,510
You...

180
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,700
Why did you break my drum?

181
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,430
Your drum is not sturdy enough.

183
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,090
Huang Ying.

184
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,770
You went too far.

185
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,240
Why are you so angry?

186
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,550
It's not your drum.

187
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,670
Since I broke it, I'll just pay her for it, alright?

188
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,400
How dare you!

189
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,230
Now that you're in the Symphony Workshop,

190
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,790
you must follow the rules here.

191
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,870
You openly damaged a fellow musician's instrument.

192
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,160
This will be recorded as a major demerit.

193
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,460
If there's a next time,

194
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,350
you'll be stripped of your musician status

195
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,680
and expelled from the Symphony Workshop.

196
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,350
Fine.

197
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,710
Now I understand.

198
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,670
You two are both on her side, aren't you?

199
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,030
Alright.

200
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,150
No need to wait for next time.

201
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,110
I'll do it right now.

202
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,770
Huang Ying!

203
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

204
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,660
Ruofei.

205
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,030
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,350
Come with me.

207
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,670
Let's go.

208
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,390
You're hurting me.

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,950
I was too lenient with you before, was I?

210
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,070
Do you need to be taught a lesson

211
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,790
to behave properly?

212
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,600
What lesson are you going to teach me?

213
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,480
Then hit me!

214
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,190
Hit me.

215
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,660
Hit me!

216
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:44,880
Stop it!

217
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,390
[Breeze Pavilion]
Stop it!

218
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,800
[Breeze Pavilion]

219
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,920
Why did you break Su Ruofei's drum?
[Breeze Pavilion]

220
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,030
Why did you break Su Ruofei's drum?

221
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,270
Because you like her!

222
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,390
Don't think I don't know that those people

223
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,270
dressed up like that

224
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,580
all because of Su Ruofei!

225
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,210
Yes.

226
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,980
I do like her.

227
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,910
Now you know there's no possibility between us.

228
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,970
Why do you like her?

229
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,550
Why do I like her?

230
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,330
Does liking someone need a reason?

231
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,190
What about her?

232
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,050
Does she like you?

233
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Does she know you like her?

234
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,470
You haven't told her?

235
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,730
You don't even dare to tell her.

236
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,940
And you still say you like her?

237
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,380
Who says I don't dare?

238
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,310
I don't believe you dare.

239
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,230
Go tell her now.

240
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,030
Fine, I'll go.

241
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,100
What's wrong? Don't want to go anymore?

242
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,870
I know what you're afraid of.

243
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,030
You're afraid she doesn't like you.

244
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,320
You're afraid that if you tell her,

245
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,110
the relationship between you two

246
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,550
will become even more distant than it is now.

247
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,750
So, you don't actually like Su Ruofei.

248
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,120
What gives you the right to say that?

249
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,650
Do you know how many times you've rejected me?

250
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,810
I'm not afraid of being rejected by you at all.

251
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm only afraid

252
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,170
that you don't know I like you.

253
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm not afraid that you don't like me either.

254
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,830
I'm only afraid of losing you,

255
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,670
you know?

256
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,180
So, you don't actually like Su Ruofei.

257
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,460
You're right.

258
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,520
I shouldn't be afraid.

259
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,190
So what if she rejects me?

260
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
What I should really be afraid of

261
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,280
is that I've liked her for so many years...

262
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,790
Yet she never knew.

263
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,960
Ruofei.

264
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,430
I'm truly sorry.

265
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,120
Huang Ying did this because of me.

266
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,620
Don't say sorry.

267
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,090
This isn't your fault.

268
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,420
How about this?

269
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,950
I'll try my best to repair this drum.

270
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,910
If I can't fix it,

271
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,680
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

272
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,090
This has nothing to do with you.

273
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,430
Don't feel guilty.

274
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,390
Actually, it's not guilt.

275
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,990
Because...

276
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,730
Your business is my business.

277
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
I can't run away anymore.

278
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,140
Today,

279
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,860
I must say everything I want to say.

280
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,210
Ruofei.

281
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,320
They're not wrong.

282
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,650
Huang Ying is not wrong either.

283
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,070
I do like you.

284
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,760
Shangyu,

285
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,270
stop joking with me.

286
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,210
I'm not joking.

287
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,030
Actually...

288
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,520
I've liked you since we were young.

289
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,310
When I was little, the thing that made me happiest

290
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,910
was being with you.

291
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,720
Even just looking at you

292
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,720
could make me happy for the entire day.

293
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,030
I was afraid you'd think I was fat,

294
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,350
so I gave up

295
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,410
the meat buns I loved eating the most.

296
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,080
I only dared to eat sparingly every day.

297
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,540
I traveled all over Dongsheng

298
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,410
just to become a better musician.

299
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,830
Because only then

300
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,740
could I have more courage

301
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,900
and confidence to stand by your side again.

302
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,070
They all envy me.

303
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,440
They say I'm the renowned Master Jin of Dongsheng.

304
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,040
But they don't know

305
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,910
that what really makes me the happiest

306
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,320
is being your little tagalong.

307
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,430
Ruofei.

308
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,550
I like you.

309
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,790
It's okay.

310
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,240
You don't need to be so nervous.

311
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm not telling you all this

312
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,870
to demand

313
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,670
an immediate response from you.

314
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,120
I just suddenly realized

315
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,230
that when I like someone,

316
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,610
I should bravely tell her.

317
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,490
This way, there won't be any regrets.

318
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,630
Shangyu.

319
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,430
I've always thought of you as

320
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,030
my best friend.

321
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,230
And...

322
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,130
And...

323
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,770
I already have someone I like.

324
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,910
Why are you here?

325
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,960
If I didn't come now,

326
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,940
I'm afraid I'd have to watch my person

327
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,450
be snatched away by Mr. Jin in public.

328
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,110
Let's go.

329
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,180
Wait a moment.

330
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,830
My feelings for Ruofei

331
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,270
are already well known in Symphony Workshop.

332
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,510
A gentleman's pursuit of love is open and honest.

333
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,910
There's nothing to hide.

334
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,590
Mr. Jin, you're so carefree.

335
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,160
It's truly admirable.

336
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,710
But you're right.

337
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,050
A gentleman's pursuit of love

338
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,850
indeed shouldn't be hidden.

339
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,110
Su Ruofei.

340
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,550
There's something I, the Young Lord,

341
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,230
must tell you clearly today.

342
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,990
You entered my heart long ago.

343
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,870
You've always been the one I liked.

344
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,910
Yun Mu.

345
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,000
So, the person in that painting really is me.

346
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,730
♫Your eyes melt into the ice♫

347
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,970
And just now, I wanted to say
♫Your eyes melt into the ice♫

348
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,060
And just now, I wanted to say

349
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,610
♫And turn it into my longing♫
And just now, I wanted to say

350
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,250
♫And turn it into my longing♫

351
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,550
that you're the one in my heart.
♫And turn it into my longing♫

352
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,020
that you're the one in my heart.

353
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,790
♫So much longing; the word is too long♫
that you're the one in my heart.

354
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,150
♫So much longing; the word is too long♫

355
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,940
Do you
♫So much longing; the word is too long♫

356
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,740
♫So much longing; the word is too long♫

357
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,220
like me?
♫So much longing; the word is too long♫

358
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,260
like me?

359
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,780
♫The stars and moon look at each other♫
like me?

360
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,810
♫The stars and moon look at each other♫

361
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,450
♫The light in my heart stirs up the waves♫

362
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,240
♫It shines because of you♫

363
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,830
♫Too much stubbornness is hidden for you♫

364
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,440
♫Don't look; forget♫

365
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,530
♫You are like the green flash of destiny above the sky♫

366
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:27,490
♫A snapshot of this moment stays in my heart forever♫

367
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:35,150
♫Let me compose and sing for you♫

368
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:43,040
♫So what if eyes grow teary?♫

369
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,870
Oh no.

370
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,510
What should I do?

371
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,990
I won't be able to show my face in Symphony Workshop anymore.

372
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,670
It's going to be a storm of drama from now on.

373
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,110
What are you worrying about?

374
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,200
Is it embarrassing to kiss me, the Young Lord?

375
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,830
It's not about embarrassment.

376
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,260
It's just that everyone in town

377
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,580
thinks I'm your favored courtesan.

378
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,750
Your behavior

379
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,970
makes things even harder to explain.

380
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,270
Are you done talking?

381
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,200
The first house rule

382
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,310
is to look at me when speaking to me.

383
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,710
Why are you the Young Lord?

384
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,590
Why did I have to fall for you of all people?

385
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,710
You finally admitted that you like me.

386
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,590
I...

387
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,550
Alright, don't worry.

388
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,600
I'll definitely propose my marriage to my father.

389
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,330
Then I'll marry you with great pomp and ceremony,

390
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,780
and make you the Young Lord's wife.

391
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,870
Stop talking.

392
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,360
No one will dare to criticize you.

393
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,900
And also,

394
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,030
if my status

395
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,590
becomes an obstacle in our relationship,

396
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,990
I'm willing to give it up.

397
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,430
Who said I was going to marry you?

398
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,030
Self-conceited.

399
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,190
Self-conceited?

400
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,470
You hugged me in public

401
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,990
and...

402
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,550
I...

403
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,390
What? You won't marry me?

404
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,550
Are you going to abandon me after leading me on?

405
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,110
You...

406
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,430
What about me?

407
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,470
Now everyone knows about

408
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,780
your feelings for me.

409
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,510
You should prepare well

410
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,020
for this test on Yearning.

411
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,410
Win the audition

412
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,230
to not waste my painstaking efforts.

413
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,100
You should just

414
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,710
put your worries away.

415
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,190
I will definitely win the audition,

416
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,710
perform for Madam Yaoshan,

417
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,970
and bring honor to Green Flash Workshop.

418
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,470
That's more like it.

419
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,630
Are you alright, old sir?

420
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,510
I'm fine.

421
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,710
Thank you, young master.

422
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,110
Good that you're alright.

423
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,090
It's a trick.

424
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,150
Old sir,

425
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,270
are you alright?

426
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm fine.

427
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,150
Thanks to this young gentleman.

428
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,070
It's good that you're okay.

429
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,230
Would you like me to bring you home?

430
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,820
No need, no need.

431
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,420
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

432
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,180
You can't finish all this by yourself.

433
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,950
I'll keep you company.

434
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,830
I'll eat with you.

435
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,270
I have investigated.

436
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,030
He is indeed

437
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,180
the person who has been delivering goods to the Symphony City restaurant.

438
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,610
He might have been bribed.

439
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,860
And that person deliberately didn't make a sound.

440
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,630
This was clearly a test.

441
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,720
If that's really the case,

442
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,750
it means my uncle

443
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,550
has already become suspicious about my deafness.

444
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,090
It was my negligence, sir.

445
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,250
This is not your fault.

446
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,130
I was careless myself.

447
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,870
However, given Yun Shang's personality,

448
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,430
he probably wouldn't stoop to using such tactics.

449
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,220
It should be Huang Fu's idea.

450
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,730
Him again.

451
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,010
Young Lord,

452
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,860
why don't you let me find a way to eliminate him?

453
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,550
No.

454
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,400
Huang Fu is brave and cunning.

455
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,710
He's also very sly.

456
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,280
Acting rashly would only fall into his trap.

457
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,120
This test wasn't really successful.

458
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,950
I believe they will have more tricks up their sleeves.

459
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,790
Xiaoqi,

460
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,150
we need to be more careful from now on.

461
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,190
Yes.

462
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,730
Young Lord.

463
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,570
But we owe thanks to Ms. Su this time.

464
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,150
You indeed took in a good ear.

465
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,630
Indeed.

466
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,190
Thanks to Ruofei.

467
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,860
[Zhaoxi Villa]

468
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,030
It seems

469
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,900
Yun Mu's hearing indeed has problems.

470
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,970
It's a pity we were interrupted in the end.

471
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,830
We couldn't gather more information.

472
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,290
Should we report this to the mayor?

473
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,800
Not for now.

474
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,750
We don't have concrete evidence yet.

475
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,350
The mayor is impulsive.

476
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,430
If this matter is exposed,

477
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,350
Yun Mu will easily be on guard.

478
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,060
The ceremony is approaching.

479
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,590
Let's not cause trouble for the mayor.

480
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,350
Once we catch Yun Mu's weakness,

481
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,610
it won't be too late to report to the mayor then.

482
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,340
Understood.

483
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,920
How is it, sir?

484
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,690
Can the drumhead be repaired?

485
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,190
Young Lord,

486
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,470
repairing this drum won't be difficult.

487
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,950
The challenge is finding

488
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,890
a drumhead similar to the original.

489
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,000
Otherwise, even if it's repaired,

490
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,990
both the timbre and feel

491
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,760
might be different from the original.

492
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,630
It would be of no use.

493
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,290
Can you find a suitable drumhead?

494
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,710
Well...

495
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,430
I can only do his best.

496
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,720
I remember Yongkang Palace

497
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,600
has a treasured Lingxiao drum.

498
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,630
You want to use the Lingxiao drum to repair this one?

499
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,630
That's right.

500
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,630
Is that possible?

501
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,660
It's possible, yes,

502
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,410
but isn't it a bit of a waste?

503
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,970
It's not a waste.

504
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,220
Let's use the Lingxiao drum to repair it.

505
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,080
How long do you think it will take?

506
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,000
If we have the drumhead,

507
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,260
it can be repaired quickly.

508
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,970
Thank you for your trouble, sir.

509
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,570
Here.

510
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,310
I'll have someone send this drum and the Lingxiao drum

511
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,910
to your residence tomorrow.

512
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,490
I will take my leave now.

513
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,150
He is

514
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,240
the most skilled instrument craftsman in Dongsheng.

515
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,770
He'll definitely be able to repair your drum.

516
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,790
What's this Lingxiao drum you just mentioned?

517
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,510
The Lingxiao drum

518
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,170
is a drum my father treasures.

519
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,230
They say the drumhead is made from alligator skin.

520
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,370
Back when my father conquered Dongsheng,

521
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,470
the Lingxiao drum was used as a war drum.

522
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,350
But after peace was restored,

523
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,510
my father kept it as a treasure.

524
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,910
It's so precious.

525
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,590
To use it to repair my drum?

526
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,190
That won't do.

527
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,190
It's too wasteful.

528
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,520
What's wrong with that?

529
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,980
Are you saying you won't repair your drum?

530
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,560
It does need to be repaired,

531
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,150
but...

532
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,220
No more buts.

533
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,790
You must remember

534
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,670
that the greatest respect for an instrument

535
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,110
is to use it to play

536
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,370
the most moving music.

537
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,660
Rather than keeping the Lingxiao drum locked away,

538
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,030
I believe my father would prefer

539
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,710
for it to be played again.

540
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,160
Don't you think?

541
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,430
Thank you, Little Dev...

542
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,310
Young Lord.

543
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,950
Little Devil is fine.

544
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,110
Why the sudden change?

545
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,350
You think I don't know how much

546
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,610
you badmouthed me behind my back before?

547
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,910
Don't worry.

548
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,870
From now on,

549
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,630
I won't badmouth you anymore.

550
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,230
Really?

551
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,550
Alright, let's go.

552
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,950
Where to?

553
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,560
To our room to sleep, of course.

554
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,830
If you haven't had enough yet,

555
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,290
I can certainly continue.

556
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,330
How many times have you said that today?

557
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,670
Can't you think of something else?

558
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,460

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,560
is when he settles down for one person.

730
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,310
Are you willing to give up all this?

731
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,240
I'm not willing!

732
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,860
From childhood until now,

733
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,990
I've always worked 1,000 times

734
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,350
harder than Su Ruofei.

735
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,390
I became the top musician in Cloud City.

736
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,710
I became the good daughter in my parents' eyes.

737
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,230
I'm better than her in every way

738
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,990
and give in to her in everything.

739
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,320
Why does she still have to take him from me?

740
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,520
So what if the Young Lord likes her?

741
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,780
She's nothing but an entertainer.

742
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,950
As for you,

743
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,080
you are highly appreciated by Madam Yaoshan.

744
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,770
Who do you think His Majesty and Madam would prefer

745
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,210
to be the future wife of the Young Lord?

746
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,910
I know what to do now.

747
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,610
I've said before

748
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,080
that the Young Lord and Ruofei

749
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,660
are a match made in heaven.

750
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,080
They should be together.

751
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,280
I can't believe I guessed correctly.

752
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,140
Now, the entire Symphony Workshop

753
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,460
is saying Ruofei is the future wife of the Young Lord.

754
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,170
Ruofei,

755
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,890
you'll definitely win the audition this time

756
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,900
and become the ceremony's musician.

757
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,390
No,

758
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,030
you'll definitely become the music minister.

759
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,870
I told you

760
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,270
to not to spread rumors.

761
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,580
Now the trouble is gone,

762
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,380
but the gossip can't be stopped.

763
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,570
Let them talk if they want to.

764
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,190
Besides,

765
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,870
what they're saying isn't wrong.

766
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,470
You will be the Young Lord's wife in the future.

767
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,680
Stop it.

768
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,330
Oh, right, Ruofei.

769
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,550
Are you planning to perform a solo for this audition

770
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,550
or as an ensemble?

771
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,680
Can we collaborate with you?

772
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,030
I've just composed a new piece

773
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
and I'd like to invite you to join me.

774
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,280
We'd love to!

775
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,750
Yes, yes!

776
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,390
We're in!

777
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,140
[Prelude to Yearning]

778
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,950
That's great!
[Prelude to Yearning]

779
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:51,970
[Prelude to Yearning]

780
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,890
We're going to perform at the ceremony!
[Prelude to Yearning]

781
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,470
We're going to perform at the ceremony!

782
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,840
I'm going to succeed!

783
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,030
[Prelude to Yearning]
I'm going to succeed!

784
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,590
[Prelude to Yearning]

785
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,290
Huang Ying.

00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:56,480
[Prelude to Yearning]

787
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,110
Huang Ying?

788
00:40:59,630 --> 00:40:59,760
[Prelude to Yearning]

789
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,220
I happen to have an opening for a pipa player.
[Prelude to Yearning]

790
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,440
[Prelude to Yearning]

791
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,940
Would you like to join us?
[Prelude to Yearning]

792
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,000
Would you like to join us?

793
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,020
[Prelude to Yearning]

794
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,260
Prelude to Yearning.
[Prelude to Yearning]

795
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,310
Prelude to Yearning.

796
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,680
[Prelude to Yearning]

797
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,390
Was this the piece composed
[Prelude to Yearning]

798
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:21,430
[Prelude to Yearning]

799
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,100
after you two kissed?
[Prelude to Yearning]

800
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,640
after you two kissed?

801
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,550
Don't say such nonsense!

802
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Ms. Huang isn't speaking nonsense.

803
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,530
What do you say?

804
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,390
Do you want to join Ruofei's team?

805
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,350
Alright.

806
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,930
Let me see

807
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,040
how good the Yearning that you've composed

808
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,590
for the Young Lord is.

809
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,350
I'm in.

810
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,320
Why isn't Master Jin here?

811
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,900
Yeah, that's right.

812
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,760
We have Prelude to Yearning here.

813
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,820
He has a Yearning Tribulation there.

814
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,270
He must be going through his own tribulation.

815
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,080
Alright, let's not talk about him.

816
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,270
When do we start?

817
00:41:59,110 --> 00:41:59,670
Okay.

818
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,750
Since we've chosen to work together,

819
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,240
there are some things I need to make clear.

820
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,040
Regardless of my relationship with the Young Lord,

821
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,960
we must

822
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,430
rely on our own abilities this time

823
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,560
to win the audition.

824
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,750
I know there will be a lot of

825
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,490
gossip about me in the future,

826
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,000
but I can use my music

827
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,490
to disprove those rumors.

828
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,360
I need your help too.

829
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Let's work together to make the Qinghe Group

830
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,380
the best group in the Symphony Workshop.

831
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,440
-Come on!
-Come on!

832
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,340
Alright, let's begin.

833
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,510
Who is it?

834
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,890
Ruoshan, why are you here?

835
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,390
I have something to tell you.

836
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,270
Do you have a moment?

837
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,030
Sure.

838
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,230
You all familiarize yourselves with the music first.

839
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,270
I'll be back soon.

840
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,180
Let's go.

841
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,410
Have a seat.

842
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,170
Ruoshan,

843
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,440
what's so mysterious

844
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,970
that you had to bring me here?

845
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,410
Tell me the truth.

846
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,800
What exactly is your relationship with the Young Lord?

847
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,460
Young Lord and I?

848
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,610
I wasn't sure before,

849
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,450
but now I believe

850
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,350
Young Lord and I

851
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,690
have mutual feelings for each other.

852
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,870
As sisters, I never thought

853
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,000
that we would fall for the same person one day.

854
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,440
The same person?

855
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,860
Ruoshan,

856
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,350
do you also...

857
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,390
Fei,

858
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,680
I have sincere feelings for Young Lord.

859
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,940
Can you please let him be with me instead?

860
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,670
-Ruoshan...
-Fei,

861
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,050
I've always let you have your way in everything,

862
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,210
always giving in to you.

863
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,080
Can you give in to me just this once?

864
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,480
Let Young Lord be with me.

865
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,920
-Give him to me.
-Ruoshan.

866
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,810
Ruoshan.

867
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,380
I know

868
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,650
you've always been good to me since we were little.

869
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,200
We're very close,

870
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,290
even closer than with our parents.

871
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,030
Whatever you want,

872
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:26,870
as long as I have it,

873
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,120
I'll give it to you.

874
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,850
But Yun Mu is a person.

875
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,230
I have no right to decide

876
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,590
what he should choose.

877
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,690
Yun Mu and I have mutual feelings for each other.

878
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,010
I can give you anything,

879
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,710
but feelings are the one thing I'm unable to give

880
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:48,700
and can't give.

881
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,630
Ruoshan.

882
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,710
There's another way.

883
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,280
Fei,

884
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,510
there's another way.

885
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,930
We're already sisters.

886
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,160
We can both marry him, right?

887
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,460
After marrying him,

888
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,830
we'll still be sisters.

889
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,190
Let's marry him together, okay?

890
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:08,950
Ruoshan!

891
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,900
I'm sorry.

892
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,160
You really won't give in?

893
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,380
I can't give in.

894
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,720
I don't have the right

895
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,550
to make this decision for Yun Mu.

896
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:37,970
I understand.

897
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,200
You can leave now.

898
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,670
Ruoshan.

899
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,350
Get out!

900
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,610
Then let's talk again

901
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,500
when you've calmed down.

902
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,510
Fei,

903
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,150
I gave you a chance.

904
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,550
You're the one who refused.

905
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,670
Don't blame me for being heartless then.
