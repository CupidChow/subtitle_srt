I'm sorry.

102
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,360
I shouldn't have shut down your workshop.

103
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,370
You actually apologized.

104
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,490
I am

105
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,060
not a selfish person

106
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,180
who holds grudges.

107
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,650
Besides, I've already had someone

108
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,140
lift the ban on your workshop.

109
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,660

That's more like it.

111
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,750
I've been meaning to ask,

112
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,420
why did you specifically choose me to be your entertainer?

113
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,040
What exactly did you see in me?

114
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,630
I've got my eye on you.

115
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,250
I'm warning you,

116
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,420
don't you dare try anything funny.

117
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,480
I mean I've got my eye on these hands of yours.

118
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,720
So just focus on being my entertainer, that's all.

119
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,790
My hands are more attractive than my face?

120
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,210
I thought

121
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,360
you were really coveting my beauty.

122
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,940
You must have some misunderstanding about beauty.

123
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,450
No wonder you think I'm not good-looking.

124
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,480
Turns out it's your taste that's the problem.

125
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,430
I... You...

126
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,940
I won't bother arguing with you.

127

128
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,010

Don't worry, Fei!

130
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,640
We'll practice diligently!

131
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,530
Our Green Flash Workshop won't be defeated!

132
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,010
This tune doesn't sound half bad.

133
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,570
It does have a certain rustic charm.

134
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,540
It's just that in the melody,

135
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
there's a hint of petty vulgarity.

136
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,160
Yes, yes.

137
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,200
The tunes from these private workshops

138
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,960
are just for a taste of rustic flavor.

139
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,220
How could they compare to

140
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,260
the refined melodies of your Melody Workshop?

141
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,840
I don't want it.

142
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,260
I'll do it myself.

143
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,500
Thank you.

144
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,610
I don't want anything you've used.

145
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
Well, I don't need it either.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
Let's continue.

147
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,320
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

148
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,690
You've had a tiring journey.

149
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,940
I see you haven't stopped playing music.

150
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,550
The Young Lord is indeed obsessed with music.

151
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,620
He's about to wear me out.

152
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,910
You know what?

153
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,050
If he could, he would make me

154
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,560
try all eighteen types of instruments.

155
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,300
I think the Young Lord might be training you.

156
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,560
You should know,

157
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,790
to become the world's top musician,

158
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,580
besides having musical skills,

159
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,330
you also need extraordinary mental strength.

160
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,160
What do you mean?

161
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,590
Years ago, when I was in the Western Regions,

162
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,820
I encountered a group of bandits on horses

163
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,140
robbing some merchants.

164
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,700
The bandit leader was ruthless.

165
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,750
But he happened to be a music fanatic.

166
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,540
So I made a bet with him.

167
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,290
If I could play

168
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,900
a piece of music he had never heard before,

169
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,330
he would release one merchant.

170
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,480
For a day and a night, I improvised

171
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,860
and played over a hundred new pieces.

172
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,680
He then released all the merchants.

173
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,410
I believe through the Young Lord's training,

174
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,920
you will surely improve your mental strength,

175
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,740
and endure what others cannot.

176
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,780
Mr. Jin, how did you manage to do it?

177
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,500
You improvised over a hundred new pieces?

178
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,780
Please tell me more about it.

179
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,690
Send someone to scout the surrounding area.

180
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,900
Make sure to inspect everything.

181
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,540
Yes, sir.

182
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,140
Go ahead.

183
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,730
Mu.

184
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,340
Mu!

185
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,620
Why isn't he responding?

186
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,180
Mu.

187
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,580
The mayor is calling you.

188
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,580
Uncle.

189
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,930
Why didn't you answer when I called?

190
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,540
Please don't blame me, Uncle.

191
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,500
I just woke up.

192
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,740
My head is still a bit foggy.

193
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,920
I didn't hear you calling me.

194
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,060
Your constitution is weak.

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,660
It's only the first day out, and you're already like this.

196
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,810
My bad, Uncle.

197
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,740
Mayor.

198
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,780
The mountain path is rugged.

199
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,070
And it's getting late.

200
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,670
Why don't you and the Young Lord rest first?

201
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,260
I'll take some men to scout ahead.

202
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,860
Go ahead.

203
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,180
I'll take my leave, sir.

204
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,220
What are you looking at, Uncle?

205
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,100
Nothing.

206
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,220
Come, have some tea.

207
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,170
Alright.

208
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,790
Xiaoqi.

209
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,660
About the music score I asked you to find earlier...

210
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,420
Are these the two you're looking for?

211
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,340
That's right.

212
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,140
It's freshly roasted.

213
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,720
Here, Shanshan.

214
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,490
You eat first.

215
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,500
Uncle.

216
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,420
When I used to go hunting with Father,

217
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,780
we often ate roasted lamb leg.

218
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,430
I have my own way of eating it.

219
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,530
I wonder if you'd like to try it, Uncle.

220
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,610
What way is that?

221
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,710
Xiaoqi.

222
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,500
Uncle, Boss Su,

223
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,470
try it.

224
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,590
Let's try.

225
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,680
How does it taste?

226
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,250
Delicious.

227
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,300
It's good, indeed.

228
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,710
But eating it in such small pieces

229
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,780
seems like a hassle, doesn't it?

230
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,060
It's more satisfying to eat it whole.

231
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,140
Uncle.

232
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,690
Just eating like this is too boring.

233
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,630
Isn't that Su Ruofei

234
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,140
already your entertainer?

235
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,450
Why don't you have her come over and play a tune

236
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,530
to liven things up for us?

237
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,720
She's been playing all the way here.

238
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,830
If she plays again...

239
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,420
Mayor.

240
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,800
It's been a tiring day for Fei.

241
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,110
Is that so?

242
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,190
Alright, let her rest for a while then.

243
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,030
This is good.

244
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,620
Is it like this?

245
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,440
Yes, that's right.

246
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,740
Then at this moment,

247
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,900
you need to lower it a bit.

248
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,380
Play it like this.

249
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,270
Actually, having her play a bit more

250
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,270
wouldn't be impossible.

251
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,660
Mr. Jin.

252
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,360
-This portion is for you.
-Don't leave it here.

253
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,450
I'm not used to eating these.

254
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,940
I'll just eat this.

255
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,080
Well, then put it here.

256
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,840
We'll eat it.

257
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,150
Mr. Jin truly has an otherworldly air about him.

258
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,530
In comparison, we seem rather uncouth.

259
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,710
Listen to that, just listen.

260
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,920
This tune is quite unpleasant.

261
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,420
It's ruining my appetite.

262
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,100
Tell her to play something else.

263
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,500
Something more cheerful.

264
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,780
Uncle.

265
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,500
Perhaps she's hungry.

266
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,330
If she doesn't play well soon,

267
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,340
she might not get a chance to eat at all.

268
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,900
Fine, I won't eat then.

269
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,870
You made me your private entertainer

270
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,120
to perform for you alone.

271
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,650
So why should I play for anyone else?

272
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,480
This little girl is quite interesting.

273
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,290
Shanshan.

274
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,940
You know, this sister of yours,

275
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,860
even though she's become Mu's entertainer,

276
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,390
she's still so fearless.

277
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,030
She's quite bold and unafraid of authority.

278
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,470
Mayor, you have great judgment.

279
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,020
Fei.

280
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,560
Since we're in high spirits today,

281
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,950
why don't I play a tune for the Mayor

282
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,000
and the Young Lord as well?

283
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,610
Sounds good.

284
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,270
Sounds good.

285
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,290
I've heard that my elder brother admires your talent.

286
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,250
He even allows you to enter the palace without bowing,

287
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,330
and leave without bidding farewell.

288
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,900
Your music must be extraordinary.

289
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,930
His Majesty is too kind.

290
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,010
No need to be modest.

291
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,670
Jin, bring us some wine.

292
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,940
-Okay.
-Keep the wine warm.

293
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,570
I'll drink after the performance.

294
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,260
It's indeed 'Intoxicated by the Clear Breeze'.

295
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,510
I've heard this piece before.

296
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,520
Back in Cloud City,

297
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,960
it was played everywhere, in every street and alley.

298
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,010
So it's called 'Intoxicated by the Clear Breeze'.

299
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,720
This is the piece that made Mr. Jin famous.

300
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,790
Even now,

301
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,410
it's still widely celebrated.

302
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,500
The original composer's rendition is still the best.

303
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,010
This carefree and unrestrained spirit

304
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,460
cannot be imitated by others.

305
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,030
This is too much.

306
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,600
He really refused to give me food.

307
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,050
Don't expect me to play for him again in the future.

308
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,920
I was wondering where you'd gone.

309
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,790
So you're hiding here alone.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,820
Young Lord, you didn't come here specifically

311
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,230
to make me play for you, did you?

312
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,700
It's one thing not to let me rest,

313
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,960
but at least let my liuqin take a break.

314
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,350
It smells so good.

315
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,860
Thank you.

316
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,370
Did I say it was for you?

317
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,620
Eat up.

318
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,670
It's for you.

319
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,670
I won't eat it.

320
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,590
You won't eat?

321
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,430
When you were playing earlier,

322
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,300
your eyes were fixed on this chicken leg.

323
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,420
You were almost drooling on your liuqin.

324
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,420
Eat it.

325
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,310
I said I won't eat it.

326
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,550
Take it away. I'm not hungry.

327
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,480
Eat it.

328
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,880
You'll need the energy to stay angry at me.

329
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,660
Mr. Jin.

330
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,720
Mr. Jin.

331
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,490
Why have you come here?

332
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,470
Did you come to find me?

333
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,670
I came to bring you a chicken leg.

334
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,480
You must be hungry.

335
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,260
I am.

336
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,390
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

337
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,250
It smells so good.

338
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,930
Eat slowly.

339
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,710
I didn't expect

340
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,230
Mr. Jin to care so much

341
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,230
about my entertainer.

342
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,630
You even personally delivered a chicken leg.

343
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,860
Don't you care about her too?

344
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,980
In fact, I was late in delivering it.

345
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,130
Not at all.

346
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,990
I wasn't planning to eat his anyway.

347
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,260
Xiaoqi.

348
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,460
Eat the chicken leg.

349
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,800
Thank you, Young Lord.

350
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,040
Eat slowly.

351
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,790
Look, your mouth is all greasy.

352
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,510
What are you doing?

353
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,190
Don't move.

354
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,320
Hand.

355
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,850
Remember, you are my entertainer.

356
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,850
You must always be mindful of your appearance.

357
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,150
Otherwise, outsiders would think my Young Lord's mansion

358
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,300
has no discipline.

359
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,790
It's getting late.

360
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,610
Mr. Jin, let's go.

361
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,590
Alright.

362
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,710
What are you doing?

363
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,560
Come with me.

364
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,590
Gentlemen.

365
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,920
Which gang are you from?

366
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm Jin Shangyu.

367
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,340
Tell us what you want.

368
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,960
If I'd known there'd be a fight, I would have eaten more.

369
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,290
Protect Ruofei.

370
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,040
Young Lord, be careful.

371
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,140
Quick, go help them.

372
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,750
Don't worry about me.

373
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,790
I can protect myself.

374
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,190
R-really?

375
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,120
Go quickly!

376
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,830
Out of nowhere,

377
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,320
how did we run into bandits?

378
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,630
Mr. Jin must not get hurt.

379
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,670
I can't believe that this little devil

380
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,990
looks quite handsome when he's fighting.

381
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,860
No matter how handsome, he's still a bad guy.

382
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,400
Mu!

383
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,290
Wait a moment.

384
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,150
Uncle.

385
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,760
Follow me and fight our way out.

386
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,860
What should we do now?

387
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,170
Don't move without my order.

388
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,850
Mayor, it's me.

389
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,870
Of course I know it's you.

390
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,740
Take them and leave quickly.

391
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,350
But...

392
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,070
Retreat!

393
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,780
Don't pursue a fleeing enemy.

394
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,220
Is everyone unharmed?

395
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,110
Yes.

396
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,530
Thanks to your timely arrival, Uncle.

397
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,660
Are you hurt?

398
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,470
Are you alright?

399
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:11,950
I'm fine.

400
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,680
It's good that everyone is safe.

401
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,280
We shouldn't linger here.

402
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,510
Let's return to the camp first.

403
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,540
Ruoshan, let me tell you.

404
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,400
The mayor is really amazing.

405
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,230
As soon as he arrived, he immediately

406
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,940
defeated those bandits.

407
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,820
It was just chasing away a few petty thieves.

408
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,810
It's nothing special.

409
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,950
Fei,

410
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,560
wasn't all this trouble because of you?

411
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,560
If you hadn't run off,

412
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,100
how would you have attracted these bandits?

413
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,870
Quickly thank the Young Lord,

414
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,540
the mayor, and Mr. Jin.

415
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,170
Thank you for saving us, Mayor.

416
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,230
Thank you for saving us, Mr. Jin.

417
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,020
Fei, what are you waiting for?

418
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,970
Thank the Young Lord.

419
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,310
Thank you, Young Lord.

420
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,920
I can't hear what you're saying.

421
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,110
Thank you, Young Lord!

422
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,680
That's more like it.

423
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,430
Alright.

424
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,770
You all should go back and rest.

425
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,510
Let's go.

426
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,500
Let's go too, Xiaoqi.

427
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,170
Mu.

428
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,310
What is it, Uncle?

429
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,470
Are you hurt?

430
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm fine.

431
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,670
That's good.

432
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,310
Mayor.

433
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,390
I arrived too late to save you.

434
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,420
I beg for your punishment, Mayor.

435
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,560
Useless.

436
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,880
You said you would be the vanguard,

437
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,820
yet you didn't even know about the bandits here.

438
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I have failed in my duty.

439
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,180
Uncle, there's no need to be angry.

440
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
General Huang couldn't have predicted

441
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,830
that bandits would dare to rob us.

442
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,600
Xiaoqi.

443
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,990
Have you discovered

444
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,310
any of the bandits' information?

445
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,870
Not yet.

446
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,910
But I've examined

447
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,150
their bodies.

448
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,310
They all have calluses on the web of their right hand

449
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,990
and the palm of their left hand.

450
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,520
There are also even calluses on their inner thighs.

451
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,180
Calluses on the inner thigh indicate years of horseback riding.

452
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,520
The hands suggest they're used to wielding swords and shields.

453
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,580
I'm afraid only the military cavalry

454
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,310
would have such calluses.

455
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,890
Uncle.

456
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,440
What?

457
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,400
Are there any deserters from the army?

458
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,280
Nonsense.

459
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,570
How can there be any deserters under my command?

460
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,110
Perhaps they are skirmishers from other cities

461
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,030
who have fled here.

462
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,260
This is Cloud City territory, after all.

463
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,870
I'm afraid we'll have to trouble you to investigate, Uncle.

464
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,800
Alright.

465
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,340
Huang Fu.

466
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,080
I order you to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.

467
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,600
Consider it a way to redeem yourself.

468
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,990
Yes.

469
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,990
I will certainly investigate thoroughly.

470
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:41,990
Young Lord.

471
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,470
I believe this matter is suspicious.

472
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,550
Under the rule of the mayor of Cloud City,

473
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,070
how could bandits appear?

474
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,370
They're soldiers too.

475
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,580
Do you think it's possible that the mayor of Cloud City

476
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,350
wanted to eliminate you under the guise of a bandit attack?

477
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,720
How dare you send people

478
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,120
behind my back to assassinate Mu?

479
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,570
You mobilized troops without authorization.

480
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,310
Do you really think I won't kill you?

481
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,520
My life is worthless.

482
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,870
I simply couldn't bear to see Yun Mu

483
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,460
take what should rightfully be yours,

484
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,610
the position of royal advisor.

485
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,660
Get up.

486
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,870
But if this matter

487
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,310
was truly done by my uncle,

488
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,940
why would he suddenly appear

489
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,680
and help us fight off the enemies?

490
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,740
Why are you so certain

491
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,920
that Yun Mu will definitely compete with me for the position?

492
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,120
Twelve years ago, he survived the poisoning.

493
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,930
I've had doubts ever since.

494
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,350
He used to be calm and steady.

495
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,400
But he claimed to be ill for half a year

496
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,350
and after recovering,

497
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,520
his personality seemed to have changed completely.

498
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,030
I suspect

499
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,100
he must have noticed something

500
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,710
and is pretending to be weak

501
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,590
to bide his time and build up strength

502
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,190
for a grand counterattack.

503
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,470
To be honest, I've always suspected

504
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,030
that the assassination attempt 12 years ago

505
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,270
had something to do with my uncle.

506
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,590
But this time when we encountered the bandits,

507
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,080
he stepped in to save us again.

508
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,940
I'm finding it increasingly difficult to understand him.

509
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,510
Even if he has no intention of usurping the position,

510
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,640
there's no guarantee that His Majesty won't pass it to him.

511
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,890
His Majesty ordered you to personally escort the group.

512
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,620
If you really step into Symphony City,

513
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,990
it'll be like a tiger entering a cage.

514
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,640
It will be too easy

515
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,220
for them to attack you.

516
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,750
Are you saying

517
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,030
my elder brother might harm me?

518
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,710
His Majesty's arrangement for the mayor of Cloud City to return to Symphony City

519
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,270
must be more than just a simple escort mission.

520
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,250
It's likely related to appointing the royal advisor.

521
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,230
We must be more careful.

522
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,330
Indeed.

523
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,590
Since Yun Mu has already discovered

524
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,990
that the bandits were disguised soldiers,

525
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,710
it's hard to say they won't suspect me.

526
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,310
I can't confront my uncle directly

527
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
right now.

528
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,600
That's why I asked him to investigate.

529
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm hoping to give him a way out.

530
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,130
However, since he's entrusted this matter

531
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
to me to handle,

532
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,780
it shows he doesn't want to break ties with me yet.

533
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,340
Just make sure you handle this matter beautifully.

534
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,830
Mayor.

535
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,560
I promise you.

536
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,910
Once I discover

537
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,860
that my brother intends to pass the throne to Mu,

538
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,430
I will personally eliminate him.

539
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,190
But before that,

540
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,460
spare his life.

541
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,930
Understood.

542
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,230
However, for the rest of our journey,

543
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,980
I don't think any other problems will arise.

544
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,030
Young Lord.

545
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,240
Boss Su, were you waiting for me?

546
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,220
Young Lord, thank you for protecting my younger sister.

547
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,890
Boss Su, you are exaggerating.

548
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,750
She is not only your sister,

549
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,270
but also my newly recruited entertainer.

550
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,030
Protecting her is naturally my duty.

551
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,770
Moreover, you saved me in the past.

552
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,550
I'm merely repaying that favor.

553
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,190
Young Lord, I can't

554
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,420
accept such praise.

555
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,240
Besides,

556
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,720
the lives of us two sisters

557
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,120
are nothing compared to yours.

558
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,590
That's not true.

559
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,890
You are just as important to me.

560
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,910
-Young Lord, I...
-Shanshan.

561
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,190
Uncle.

562
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,730
Get in the carriage.

563
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,100
Then I will take my leave.

564
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,100
I hope to have the chance to repay you in the future.

565
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,120
Okay.

566
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,200
It seems my uncle is truly infatuated with her.

567
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,590
I wonder if my recognition of her

568
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,590
will make this relationship even more complicated.

569
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,870
That was truly amazing.

570
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,190
The composition techniques you just taught me

571
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,050
were incredibly useful.

572
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
How about next time, we...

573
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,350
You should head back first.

574
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,610
I'll teach you slowly on the way.

575
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,830
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

576
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,640
Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Jin.

577
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,010
Young Lord, you're too kind.

578
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,680
Actually,

579
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,840
I did it mainly to protect Su Ruofei this time.

580
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,690
Is it still about that favor you mentioned last time?

581
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,110
Indeed.

582
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,720
I promised to help her revive the workshop.

583
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,660
Before I repay this favor,

584
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,890
I won't let anything happen to her.

585
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,000
You are indeed a man of your word.

586
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,510
When we return to Symphony City,

587
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,360
I hope you'll visit the mansion more often.

588
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,150
Certainly.

589
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,920
Let's go.

590
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,620
You're quite conscientious today.

591
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,080
It's better than being scolded by you.

592
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,230
Alright, let's stop for a moment.

593
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,030
I have a question for you.

594
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,750
What favor does Mr. Jin owe you exactly?

595
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,860
It's not really a favor.

596
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,640
It's just that when I was on the road before,

597
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,790
I helped him avoid Huang Ying once.

598
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,110
Is it that simple?

599
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
You helped him avoid Huang Ying once,

600
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,710
and he's protecting you like this?

601
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,980
Doesn't this just prove

602
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,570
that our Mr. Jin Shangyu is a chivalrous hero?

603
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,430
My kindness was like a drop of water,

604
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,780
but he repays it with a gushing spring.

605
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,520
Stop right there.

606
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,490
Play.

607
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,360
After all that talk,

608
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,030
you still just want me to play music.

609
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,630
Excuse me,

610
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,010
the hot buns are here.

611
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,180
Miss,

612
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,360
the usual today?

613
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,110
The usual.

614
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,710
Alright, just a moment.

615
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,800
You won't let me enter Cloud City?

616
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,280
Then I'll wait here in Symphony City.

617
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,310
This is the only way to Symphony Workshop.

618
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,350
I bet I'll run into you.

619
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,100
Miss,

620
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,970
you've been coming here for several days in a row.

621
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,650
I see you're carrying a pipa.

622
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,880
Are you trying to enter the Symphony Workshop of Symphony City?

623
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,670
I'm here to find my husband.

624
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,620
Is your husband also a musician?

625
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,640
My husband?

626
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,510
He's the second-best musician in the world.

627
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,490
Second?

628
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,100
Then who's the first?

629
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,040
Me.

630
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,780
Impressive, truly impressive.

631
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,460
[Symphony City]

632
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,750
So this is Symphony City?

633
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,400
It's indeed grander than Cloud City.

634
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,930
You don't need to be so excited.

635
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,960
You'll be living here for a long time.

636
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,270
You'll have time to enjoy Symphony City's prosperity.

637
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,410
Can I come out to have fun anytime?

638
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,980
It'll depend on my mood.

639
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,360
It's been many years since I've returned to Symphony City.

640
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,730
Symphony City has become more and more prosperous.

641
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,520
Shanshan,

642
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,550
come and take a look too.

643
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,250
I just want to go to Symphony Workshop right away.

644
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,200
Alright.

645
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,350
I have to go see my brother later,

646
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,710
so I can't accompany you.

647
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,760
But don't worry.

648
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,960
I'll recommend you to my brother and sister-in-law.

649
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,300
I'll take you to meet my sister-in-law later.

650
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,130
You'll surely have a lot to talk about.

651
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,590
Really?

652
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,120
Of course.

653
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,830
I said I'll help you become the music minister.

654
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,990
I never go back on my word.

655
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,680
Thank you, Mayor.

656
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,030
Why are you being so formal with me?

657
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,470
Will we pass by Symphony Workshop?

658
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,140
No.

659
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,400
But if you want to go,

660
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,090
I'll personally take you there.

661
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,700
Xiaoqi will take you back to the mansion first.

662
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,400
I have to to pay my respects to His Majesty.

663
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,010
Pay respects to His Majesty?

664
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,680
You can meet Madam Yaoshan now.

665
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,860
Take me with you.

666
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,680
That will have to wait until you have the qualifications for an audience.

667
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,930
Can Mr. Jin go?

668
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,360
What about my sister?

669
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,610
Can my sister go?

670
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,840
If you keep chattering,

671
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,300
you'll never get to see Madam Yaoshan.

672
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,410
That's more like it.

673
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,260
The wine in Symphony City is really good.

674
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,990
Jin!

675
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,070
Jin, Jin.

676
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,520
Jin!

677
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,580
Mr. Jin, how have you been?

678
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,530
Thanks to Your Majesty's blessing,

679
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,580
I've been well.

680
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,620
Mu has done a good job on this errand.

681
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,800
You even brought Mr. Jin here.

682
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,830
It's a great achievement.

683
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,550
Your Majesty,

684
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,180
I have two small requests regarding my stay

685
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,500
at the Symphony Workshop.

686
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
I hope Your Majesty can grant them.

687
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,160
Speak freely.

688
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,240
First,

689
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,580
I won't participate in the competition for the position of music minister.

690
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,620
Second,

691
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,290
I don't want to be a judge at the Symphony Workshop.

692
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,060
I just want to find a quiet place

693
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,900
to compose music in.

694
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,570
If Your Majesty wants to listen to music,

695
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,100
I'll be at your service anytime

696
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,470
as long as you prepare good wine.

697
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,430
Alright.

698
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,220
Father,

699
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,720
Mr. Jin

700
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,690
can only stay until the end of Mother's Jiuru Banquet.

701
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,330
I took the liberty

702
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,550
of agreeing to Mr. Jin's requests first,

703
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,210
but the final decision is still up to you.

704
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,290
Since you've already promised Mr. Jin,

705
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,610
how can I go back on one's word?

706
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,880
It's granted.

707
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,400
Mr. Jin,

708
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,560
why don't you stay in the palace

709
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,990
like before?

710
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,840
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty,

711
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,120
but this time,

712
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,690
I'd prefer to stay at the Symphony Workshop.

713
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,120
Very well.

714
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,080
Then stay at the Breeze Pavilion of the Symphony Workshop.

715
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,270
You're allowed to enter the palace anytime.

716
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,530
Thank you, Your Majesty.

717
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,250
Mu,

718
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,860
your mother knows you're back.

719
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,700
She wants you to bring the musicians from Cloud City

720
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,840
to see her with you

721
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,560
to ease her homesickness.

722
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,560
Go quickly now.

723
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,670
Okay.

724
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,600
Then I'll take my leave.

725
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,050
I'll head back to the Symphony Workshop first.

726
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,990
Why did my brother let Mu

727
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,580
take Shanshan to my sister-in-law?

728
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,790
Isn't that stealing my credit?

729
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,830
Shang.

730
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,440
Brother.

731
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,720
I've missed you so much.

732
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,060
I've missed you too, Brother.

733
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,260
Come, come, have a seat.

734
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,930
You must be tired from the journey.

735
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,030
This short journey is nothing.

736
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,750
It's much easier compared to fighting in battles.

737
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,870
You've been stationed in Cloud City all these years.

738
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,890
I often tell the other mayors

739
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,030
that the stability of Dongsheng

740
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,510
depends on Cloud City.

741
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,840
As long as Dongsheng is stable,

742
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,720
I won't fear even death.

743
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,710
As expected of my good little brother.

744
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,830
I'm getting old now.

745
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,290
The future of Dongsheng

746
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,510
will depend on you and Mu from now on.

747
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,500
Dongsheng's current territory

748
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,240
was gained because you led us mayors

749
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,790
to fight for each inch with our blood.

750
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,680
Only we know the hardships we've been through.

751
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,010
That's why we must maintain Dongsheng's stability.

752
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,270
Mu was born in peaceful times.

753
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,830
How can he understand our hardships?

754
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,800
I see that all he does

755
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,520
is hang around with those entertainers.

756
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,060
Brother, you really should have a good talk with him.

757
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,260
In the future,

758
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,470
Dongsheng will rely on us.

759
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,790
Indeed.

760
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,500
Mu is still young now.

761
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,950
I'm worried about him too.

762
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,550
That's why I specifically asked you to come along this time.

763
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,590
I want you, as his uncle,

764
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,160
to guide him well.

765
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,920
No matter how close the other mayors are,

766
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,310
they can't compare to us.

767
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,910
After all, we are family.

768
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,030
We must stay united.

769
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,930
Rest assured, Brother.

770
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,810
Mu is my only nephew.

771
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,210
I will certainly take good care of him.

772
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,260
Of course.

773
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,880
Now that you're here,

774
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,530
don't rush in returning.

775
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,160
Wait until after your sister-in-law's birthday banquet.

776
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,720
During this time,

777
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,000
let's catch up, brother to brother.

778
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,800
Alright, thank you, Brother.

779
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,760
Come, cheers.

780
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,310
Cheers.

781
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,200
I can stay to accompany Shanshan now.
