The sound it makes is amazing.

Your workshop is incredible.

39
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,790
When you came to the Symphony Workshop the other day,

40
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,380
there were too many people, so we didn't greet you.

41
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,470

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,270
that instead of helping you,

43
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,260
Su Ruoshan had someone kick you out.

44
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,380
She didn't look like your sister at all.

that we were talentless,

64
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,100
we wouldn't have fallen so low

65
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,350
as to play accompaniment for those second-rate musicians.

66
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,990
This time,

67
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,470
we must teach Su Ruoshan a lesson.

Master Jin may have a free spirit,

71
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,480
but the Young Lord is not a nobody.

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,830
How could he possibly perform on the street

73
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,690
with Su Ruofei?

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,780
We saw it with our own eyes!

75
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,990
So,

76
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,720
the rumor is true?

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,010
The Young Lord likes Su Ruofei.

78
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,780
That's why he abandoned Ms. Su

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,160
and went all the way to Cloud City.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,390
Why hasn't the official marriage decree

81
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,510
been issued yet?

82
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,570
In my opinion, they're not likely to get married.

83
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,990
They chose to perform at the Moonlight Tower

84
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,150
near the Symphony Workshop.

85
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,970

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
No.

87
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,370

Where are you all going?

90
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,760
Ms. Su.

91
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,270
It was nothing but a crowd-pleasing

92
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,360
street performance,

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,090
yet you're so unsettled.

94
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,360
No wonder they look down on us

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
and dare to challenge us.

96
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,040
Su Ruofei alone is no threat,

97
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,670
but the Young Lord and Master Jin have…

98
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,380
So what?

99
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,840
Don't forget

100
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,670
that this is the Symphony Workshop.

101

104
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,130
let alone that insignificant Green Flash Workshop.

105
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,190
Ms. Su is right.

106
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,890
We have no reason to fear them.

107
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,100

112
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,400

113
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,690
to attract attention,

114
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,590
but so what?

115
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,070
You're not even qualified to participate

116
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
in the Jiuru Banquet.

117
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm the only one who can be the music minister.

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,940

It's fine.

Come on, eat up.

129
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,770
Delicious.

130
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,120

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
What's wrong?

132
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,360
N-Nothing.

133
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,500
I didn't expect our first performance

134

to be so well-received.

135
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,110
I knew it all along.

136
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,300
Just look at

who we have on our team.

138
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,480
Exactly.

139
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,930
In Symphony City,

140
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,930
I do have some prestige.

141
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,310
Don't forget

142
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,030
how charming Shangyu is.

143
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,870
I can only say Shangyu and I

144
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,420
are on par with each other.

145
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,270
Right.

146
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,070
Indeed.

147
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,870
That's right.

148
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,410
Am I right, Shangyu?

Now that everyone is full of confidence,

160
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,730
I can't let them worry about me and be distracted.

161
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,920
Why are you hiding here alone?

162
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,840
The smell of alcohol is too strong in there.

163
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,440
I came out for some fresh air.

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
You do need some fresh air.

165
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,070
If I remember correctly, someone is a bad drunk.

166
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,580
Who are you calling a bad drunk?

167
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,790
Dear Boss Su.

168
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,810
May I dance with you?

169
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,890

Didn't I tell you in my letter

188

to wait for news at the Symphony Workshop?

189

Have you heard that the Young Lord and the Green Flash Workshop

190

performed on the street?

191
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Yes, I have.

192
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,780
What's your plan?

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,060
What exactly happened

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,810
during your trip to Cloud City?

195
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,010
How did the Young Lord return safely to Symphony City?

196
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,820
And Fei.

197
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,270
Wasn't her hand injured?

198
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,790
How could she still perform on the street?

199
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,780
She even came to the Symphony Workshop to issue a challenge.

200
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,610
I know nothing about these things.

201
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,700
How can I be at ease?

202
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,810
It's all my fault.

203
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,120
Come on, sit down first.

204
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,890
Sit down.

205
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,010
My bad.

206
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
It's all my fault.

207
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,210
I just didn't want you to get involved in this

208
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,340
and be implicated because of me if something went wrong,

209
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,800
so I didn't make things clear in my letter.

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,750
Jin indeed

211
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,300
hurt Su Ruofei's hand,

212
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
but he didn't hurt it badly enough.

213
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,820
Since that's the case,

214
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
I'll order another attempt.

215
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,470
I misunderstood you, Mayor.

216
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,720
There's no need for further action against Fei.

217
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,430
The musician audition for the Jiuru Banquet is approaching.

218
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,470
She's not qualified for it.

219
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,670
I don't need to worry.

220
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,590
As for the Young Lord,

221
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,260
he escaped from your grasp this time.

222
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,210
It'll be difficult for you to act against him again.

223
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,790
This time in Cloud City,

224
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,200
I didn't kill Mu as planned,

225
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,040
but I discovered

226
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,190
a shocking secret.

227
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
Yun Mu

228
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,240
can never become the royal advisor.

229
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,270
What secret?

230
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,670
Isn't that Master Jin?

231
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,810
It's really Master Jin.

232
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,750
-Master Jin.
-Master Jin.

233
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,350
We have a few questions

234
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,490
we'd like to ask you.

235
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,710
-Why is he leaving?
-Master Jin!

236
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,470
Master Jin!

237
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,210
-Master Jin!
-Master Jin!

238
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,090
Where is he?

239
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,360
Let's check up ahead.

240
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,710
Okay.

241
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,750
Huang Ying!

242
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,130
[Huiyin Hall]

243
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,780
In the blink of an eye,

244
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,360
you've spent countless days and nights

245
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,820
at the Symphony Workshop.

246
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,250
Here, you've honed your musical skills

247
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,990
and finally completed

248
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,250
the highly significant audition today.

249
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,100
After our deliberation,

250
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,060
the lead musicians for the Jiuru Banquet will be

251
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,670
Su Ruoshan and her Shouyang Group.

252
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,310
Great!

253
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:14,860
Great!

254
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,580
[Jiuru Banquet]

255
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,030
This is the invitation from the Yongkang Palace
[Jiuru Banquet]

256
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,350
for the Jiuru Banquet.
[Jiuru Banquet]

257
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,420
[Jiuru Banquet]

258
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,380
I've filled in the names of the leading members of the Shouyang Group.

259
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,380
Su Ruoshan, please come forward on behalf of the Shouyang Group

260
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,170
to receive this honor.

261
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,440
[Huiyin Hall]

262
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,450
[Jiuru Banquet]

263
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,750
This time, you'll lead the musicians

264
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,290
to perform for His Majesty and Madam Yaoshan.

265
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,900
You must give it your all

266
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,310
and bring glory to the Symphony Workshop.

267
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,900
Yes, Music Director.

268
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,810
If I'm right,

269
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,640
when you return,

270
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,540
your status will be different.

271
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,620
I will definitely not fail

272
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,030
your teachings.

273
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,320
What do you want?

274
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Don't you know us?

275
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,220
You…

276
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,380
It's you two!

277
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,940
Let's go. We'll buy you tea.

278
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,670
Let's go.

279
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,350
My buns!

280
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,760
Here, Monkey.

281
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,110
A toast to you.

282
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,790
Cheers.

283
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,120
Monkey,

284
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,950
we used to be in the same group

285
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,340
with Ruofei at the Symphony Workshop.

286
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,480
At that time, Ruofei helped us a lot.

287
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,690
She's talented

288
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,710
and very skilled.

289
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,200
We benefited a lot from working with her.

290
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,990
Yes.

291
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,080
At that time, Ruofei, Huang Ying, and the two of us

292
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,110
outshone

293
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,000
Su Ruoshan's Shouyang Group every time we performed.

294
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
Of course.

295
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,040
But unfortunately, it was also the reason

296
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,270
why Ruofei suffered misfortunes later.

297
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,100
Because of Su Ruoshan?

298
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,400
Yes.

299
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,980
Many people say in private

300
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,320
that Su Ruoshan was jealous of Ruofei,

301
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,350
so she framed her

302
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,030
and got her kicked out of the Symphony Workshop.

303
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,230
Don't talk nonsense.

304
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,970
They are sisters.

305
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,260
Why is Su Ruoshan so cruel?

306
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,800
Indeed.

307
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,260
What exactly happened?

308
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,750
Fei never told us about it.

309
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:32,810
Closer.

310
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
That was outrageous!

311
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,510
She's just a coachman's daughter!

312
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,030
S-She…

313
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,720
A coachman's daughter?

314
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,520
How dare she bully Fei like that?

315
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,820
Wait, Monkey.

316
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,950
Why did you call her a coachman's daughter?

317
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,710
Sit down. Tell us about it.

318
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,510
Take your time. Tell us about it.

319
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,950
You…

320
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,790
-Take your time. Tell us about it.
-Calm down.

321
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,560
Her family and mine were neighbors.

322
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,780
Her father was Fei's family's coachman

323
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,650
and died young.

324
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,610
Mr. Su kindly adopted her.

325
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,690
Who would have thought

326
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,230
that she's an...

327
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:11,760
Is that so?

328
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,510
An ingrate!

329
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,230
If it weren't for the Su family,

330
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,400
she w-w-wouldn't be who she is today.

331
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,880
Monkey.

332
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,100
Monkey.

333
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,260
Calm down.

334
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,210
Look at her.

335
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,470
I'm so surprised.

336
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,770
It's her.

337
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,470
Have you heard?

338
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,000
It's her?

339
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,290
Indeed,

340
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,310
you can't judge a book by its cover.

341
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,790
Exactly.

342
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,210
She's so good at acting.

343
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,180
Ms. Su.

344
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,890
Where is everyone else?

345
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,460
I'm the only one who came today.

346
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,890
Only you?

347
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,290
Give it to me.

348
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,430
[Cultivate With Music]
Give it to me.

349
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,650
[Cultivate With Music]

350
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,620
What are you doing?
[Cultivate With Music]

351
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,350
Give it to me.
[Cultivate With Music]

352
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:12,840
[Cultivate With Music]

353
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,460
We're discussing how to play soccer.

354
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,090
Right?

355
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,150
Yes.

356
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,450
The Jiuru Banquet is coming,

357
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,650
yet you're fooling around here.

358
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,980
Go back to practice now!

359
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,760
Guys, look.

360
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,890
Ms. Su is still on her high horse.

361
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,650
Do you mean

362
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,940
you're not going back?

363
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,680
No.

364
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,720
With your current status,

365
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,680
you think you can give us orders?

366
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,920
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

367
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,750
-You're just a coachman's daughter.
-Yes.

368
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,150
What gives you the right to order us around?

369
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,620
Someone took pity on her,

370
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,740
yet she's seeing herself as someone important.

371
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,640
What are you talking about?

372
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,400
Isn't it clear enough?

373
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,350
You're the daughter of a coachman.

374
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,610
Now, we all know

375
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,380
that you're nothing but a servant.

376
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,720
So stop giving yourself airs.

377
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,270
You…

378
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,550
How dare you try to slap me?

379
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,650
My hand!

380
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,880
My hand!

381
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,710
Anyone who talks

382
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,920
that nonsense again

383
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,040
will end up just like him.

384
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,800
My hand.

385
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,150
My hand!

386
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,800
Don't you know

387
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,590
that in Dongsheng,

388
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,320
the Yun family calls the shots?

389
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,230
[Cloud Pavilion]

390
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,230
Shanshan.

391
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,100
Those scumbags

392
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,530
spread rumors and caused you trouble.

393
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,990
Don't take

394
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,270
what they said to heart.

395
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,910
Okay?

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,680
What if what they said is true?

397
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,370
Thank you, Mayor, for helping me out just now

398
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,570
and saving my face in front of everyone.

399
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,000
Now that you've known my parentage,

400
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,640
please forget all the promises made before.

401
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,210
Shanshan.

402
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,540
What are you talking about?

403
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,570
I like you for you,

404
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,970
not for your parentage.

405
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,170
If you want status,

406
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,260
before long,

407
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,470
I'll make sure you stand

408
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,870
on the top of the pyramid.

409
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,450
I'll make everyone who mocked you

410
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,680
grovel at your feet.

411
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,590
I know you're just trying to comfort me,

412
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,220
but I feel very content.

413
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,040
Shanshan.

414
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,690
What do I need to do

415
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,070
to make you believe I'm serious about you?

416
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,930
Look.

417
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,770
Where did you get this?

418
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,140
On the night the Symphony Workshop caught fire,

419
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,000
I led people in for investigation

420
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,250
and found this.

421
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,990
I was afraid someone might find it and suspect you,

422
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,490
so I hid it.

423
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,100
You knew all along that I set the fire.

424
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,470
Everyone says I'm foolish,

425
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,600
including Huang Fu.

426
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,050
They all think

427
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,000
you've blinded me.

428
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,150
They say you're…

429
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,360
They say you're the bane of my life.

430
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,320
But what does that mean?

431
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,710
It's just men's excuse

432
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,970
for their ineptitude.

433
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,450
When they like you,

434
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,210
you're their beloved.

435
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,160
They say

436
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,610
they can give up everything for you.

437
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,280
But when things go south,

438
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,470
they blame women for being the bane

439
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,150
and say they were bewitched.

440
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,120
Such men

441
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,640
are nothing but cowards!

442
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,310
I've done many things along the way…

443
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,710
So many that I don't know which ones were right

444
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,420
and which ones were wrong.

445
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,100
Right choices

446
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,730
or wrong decisions,

447
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't care.

448
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,780
You're the woman I love.

449
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,960
Even if you had committed a terrible crime,

450
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,480
I'd bear the consequences with you.

451
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,770
Actually, I know…

452
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,770
you don't like me at all.

453
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,450
You've been using me all this time.

454
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,760
But so what?

455
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,670
Even if I'm being used by you,

456
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,890
as long as I can be by your side,

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,130
I'm satisfied.

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,900
Let me check on you.

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,570
What happened?

507
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,110
Did you get into a fight?

508
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,960
I…

509
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,510
Eleven,

510
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,460
go get some medicine for his wounds.

511
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,730
Okay.

512
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,780
No.

513
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,500
I-I was just walking

514
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,000
when someone suddenly rushed out and hit me.

515
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,360
He said I s-slandered an important figure

516
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,360
a-and threatened

517
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,010
to c-cut out my tongue.

518
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,790
Did you reveal

519
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,790
Su Ruoshan's parentage to someone?

520
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,320
Recently, I've heard

521
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,860
that many people at the Symphony Workshop are gossiping

522
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,160
about Su Ruoshan being a coachman's daughter.

523
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,000
I…

524
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,200
I was just too angry,

525
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,400
and what I said is true.

526
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,050
Alright.

527
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,900
You should all be careful when going out lately.

528
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,260
Let me do the shopping from now on.

529
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,060
By the way…

530
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,140
When I was being beaten,

531
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,650
someone saved me with this.

532
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,330
Where were you beaten?

533
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,350
J-Just in that alley on my way back.

534
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,950
As I thought, she's been around all along.

535
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,600
Who's playing that ominous tune?

537
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,120
Ruoshan, how was it?

538
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,950
How did I play?

539
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,020
[Cloud Pavilion]

540
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,030
You came here at night

541
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,550
to play a funeral tune.

542
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,770
What do you mean?

543
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,090
I played this tune

544
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,240
to bid farewell to Biao.

545
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,510
Biao was killed

546
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,970
by the assassins sent by Cloud City's mayor.

547
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,420
Do you know that?

548
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,400
Why should I know about that?

549
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,930
Then I'll tell you something you should know.

550
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,620
Monkey got beaten up

551
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,080
because he revealed your parentage.

552
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,550
A loose-lipped jerk.

553
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,770
It serves him right.

554
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,070
Actually, I also think he shouldn't have spoken carelessly

555
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,750
and revealed your secret.

556
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,680
But you shouldn't have

557
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,510
sent someone to hurt him either.

558
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,490
If you're right

559
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,110
that he's a jerk…

560
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,330
Then, Ruoshan,

561
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,840
does it mean you're a bitch?

562
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,000
What are you saying?

563
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,340
I never thought

564
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,860
you'd become so vulgar!

565
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,270
I'd rather become vulgar

566
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,290
than become despicable like you!

567
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,670
You…

568
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,840
I thought you were just good at music,

569
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,670
but it turns out

570
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,230
that you're also good at mechanisms.

571
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,980
You were so clever to tie a string to the hanging light

572
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,540
and put a fuse in the candle.

573
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,070
Ruoshan, you're truly ingenious.

574
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,960
It's a pity you have ill intentions.

575
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,660
Did you come here

576
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,830
just to say strange things?

577
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,470
No.

578
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,820
I'm here to warn you.

579
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,510
Su Ruoshan,

580
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,040
from now on, we're no longer sisters.

581
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,390
In the future,

582
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,520
if you dare to lay a finger on my friend again,

583
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,810
next time I play a funeral tune with this suona,

584
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,680
it'll be for you.

585
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,170
Are you threatening me?

586
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,700
Don't you feel threatened?

587
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,250
Then I'll tell you one more thing.

588
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,080
The position of music minister…

589
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,880
As long as I'm breathing,

590
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,540
you can never get it.

591
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,320
You think you can defeat me?

592
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,060
Fine.

593
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,340
But your musical skills

594
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,600
need to be as good as your ability to boast first.

595
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,380
Then, let's wait and see?

596
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,370
No problem.

Boss Su.

609
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,270
My mistress heard you play just now

610
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,430
and was very impressed.

611
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,870
She'd like to meet you.

612
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,790
Your mistress?

613
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,270
Do I know her?

614
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,720
She must appreciate you very much.

615
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,990
Let me accompany you to meet her.

616
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,150
Fei.

617
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,390
Let's go.

618
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,450
Please wait here for a moment.

619
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,470
I wonder who it is that wants to meet you.

620
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,800
Perhaps it's someone who likes the Green Flash Workshop.

621
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,410
I hope so.

622
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,220
Ms. Su, you're truly an excellent musician.

623
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,110
That Green Flash Song made me feel

624
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,540
indescribable freshness

625
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,950
and exuberance.

626
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,770
Thank you for your praise.

627
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,550
May I know who you are?

628
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,030
You altered my song

629
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,120
and stole the heart of my good-for-nothing son,

630
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,290
yet you don't know who I am.

631
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,970
It makes me a bit sad.

632
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,430
You're Madam Yaoshan?

633
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,720
Madam Yaoshan, greetings.

634
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,500
Please, rise.

635
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,370
Thank you, Madam Yaoshan.

636
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,210
Have a seat.

637
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,520
I heard from Mu that you were originally

638
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,030
ranked top in the audition for the ceremonial musician.

639
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,360
But due to the fire in the instrument room,

640
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,490
you lost the qualification to participate in the Jiuru Banquet.

641
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,270
However, your Green Flash Song

642
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,110
made me feel as if I had returned

643
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,040
to Cloud City which I always missed

644
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,790
and seen long rivers and endless green forests.

645
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,620
It was truly marvelous.

646
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,560
I took the liberty of altering your song.

647
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,010
Please forgive me, Your Ladyship.

648
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,820
No song remains unchanged forever.

649
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,400
Music is inherently tied to one's state of mind.

650
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,330
Different moods naturally lead to different tunes.

651
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,930
If every song was the same,

652
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,470
how boring would this world be?

653
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,270
Take the Green Flash Song, for instance.

654
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,100
I've heard it countless times,

655
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,240
but only your version made me feel

656
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,780
the essence of the Green Flash Forest in Cloud City.

657
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,460
Really?

658
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,870
Mother,

659
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,690
I was right, wasn't I?

660
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,350
Her workshop is wonderful.

661
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,880
How can you bear to let it fade into obscurity?

662
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Ms. Su.

663
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,230
I wonder if you're interested in

664
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,910
bringing your Green Flash Workshop

665
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,840
to perform at my birthday banquet.

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,490

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,750
The Jiuru Banquet!

669
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,000
I can perform at the Jiuru Banquet?

670
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,580
Silly girl,

671
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,510
don't look at me.

672
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,760
Say thank you.

673
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,910
Thank you, Madam Yaoshan.

674
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,460
No need for such formality.

675
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,800
However, when you played the Green Flash Song just now,

676
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,730
there was a bar where your rhythm was off.

677
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,060
What was the problem?

678
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,580
Perhaps it's because I performed for a long time

679
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,110
and my hands were a bit sore.

680
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,910
Then you should have a good rest.

681
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,080
I hope that at my birthday banquet,

682
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,140
I can see your perfect performance.

683
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,070
It'll be good for you two.

684
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,030
Okay.

685
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,530
I'll practice hard

686
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,260
and meet

687
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,750
your expectations of us.

Only you

705
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,680
could persuade Madam Yaoshan to come.

706
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,900
I just acted as a go-between.

707
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,620
We're invited because our Green Flash Workshop

708
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,020
has gained recognition.

709
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,550
Otherwise, no matter how much I talked,

710
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,090
I couldn't get this invitation.

711
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,820

By the way, Ruofei,

716
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,400
did you not sleep well last night?

717
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,200
There was a small mistake today.

718
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,250
I'm fine.

719
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Don't worry.

720
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,170
I'll make sure she gets good rest.

What's wrong?

736
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,550
When did your hand become like this?

737
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,400
I…

738
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,310
Didn't I just say?

739
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,270
My hand is just a bit sore from performing for so long.

740
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,280
Don't lie to me.

741
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,820
After this hand was injured that day,

742
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,120
it became stiff and slow

743
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,950
and shakes uncontrollably when I exert force.

744
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,030
But don't worry.

745
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,250
It should be a temporary symptom.

746
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,590
I believe it'll get better soon.

747
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,510
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

748
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,400
No.

749
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,070
We can't be careless about this.

750
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,370
I'll have Xiaoqi invite Imperial Physician Zhang over.

751
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,680
He's an expert

752
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,540
on treating external injuries.

753
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,840
Does it hurt?

754
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,020
A little.

755
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,660
Imperial Physician Zhang.

756
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,060
How is Ruofei's hand?

757
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,910
Your Highness, don't worry.

758
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Ms. Su's hand injury is not serious.

759
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,310
It appears to have healed on the surface,

760
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,960
but the muscle and bone have not fully healed.

761
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,020
She only needs acupuncture for about a week

762
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,670
along with acupressure to promote blood circulation.

763
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,800
Then she'll be fine.

764
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,960
So my hand can heal before the Jiuru Banquet?

765
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,920
Then please come here daily to perform acupuncture.

766
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,550
I'll personally do the acupressure part myself.

767
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,140
Okay. I'll go get prepared.

768
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm very good at acupressure.

769
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,610
You're quite good.

770
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,630
Of course.
