00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,230
music should bring people joy.

192
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,790
There shouldn't be

193
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,150
so many rigid rules.

194
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,220
Later, I met

195
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,540
Monkey Zhao, Eleven, and Biao.

196
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,840
We established Green Flash Workshop.

197
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,310
Those were my happiest times.

198
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,300
We created many beautiful and innovative tunes.

199
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,830
But my favorite

200
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,510
is still "Green Flash Song."

201
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,840
It contains some wonderful memories.

202
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,550
I've arranged many versions of it.

203
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,830
I've been hoping for the day

204
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,390
I could play it for Madam Yaoshan.

205
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,820
I want to tell her

206
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,630
that there's a young girl

207
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,860
who has admired her all her life

208
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,790
and hopes to become

209
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,830
as great a musician as her.

210
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,690
But more than that, I want to prove to her

211
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,430
that my innovative music and other folk music

212
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,230
are not beneath standard music.

213
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,030
I hope all musicians and songs in the world

214
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,530
can be distinguished by schools

215
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,490
and styles

216
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,100
but not how standard they are.

217
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,030
After all, my original music aspiration

218
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,110
is to bring joy to everyone.

219
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,910
Well said.

220
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,580
[Constant Reflection and Cultivation]

221
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,700
Music brings joy to people.
[Constant Reflection and Cultivation]

222
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,660
[Constant Reflection and Cultivation]

223
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,060
I never would've guessed
[Constant Reflection and Cultivation]

224
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,170
[Constant Reflection and Cultivation]

225
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,710
that such a mischievous little wildcat

226
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,490
would have such grand dreams.

227
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,150
If that's the case,

228
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll take you

229
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,630
to meet Madam Yaoshan tomorrow, yeah?

230
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,390
Really?

231
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,190
But I don't want to meet her like this.

232
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,990
Why not?

233
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,150
I want to rely on my own abilities

234
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,070
to perform in front of her.

235
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,310
I thought I had a chance,

236
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,230
but now I don't even have my music status

237
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,870
or the chance to enter Symphony Workshop.

238
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,310
It's okay.

239
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,560
From now on,

240
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,110
I'll just be content

241
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,450
to be your little ears.

242
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,060
Xiaoqi told me everything about you.

243
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,470
All these years...

244
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
you've suffered.

245
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,220
About this suffering...

246
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,420
I've gotten used to it after all this time.

247
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,390
But from now on, because I have you,

248
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,640
everything will be different.

249
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,070
Young Lord.

250
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,110
I'll go play the qin now.

251
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,250
[Open and Aboveboard]

252
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,720
You've wiped

253
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,270
this chair eight times.

254
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,590
Have I?

255
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
You've wiped this table five times.

256
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,590
What's up?

257
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,010
Nothing.

258
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,890
Stop there.

259
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,310
Come here.

260
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,540
Usually, when I told you to clean here once every three days,

261
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,590
you often dragged it out.

262
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,540
Why are you suddenly so diligent?

263
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,360
Tell me.

264
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,090
Do you need a favor from me,

265
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,050
or did you get into trouble?

266
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,550
You never allow others into this study.

267
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,840
But Su Ruofei has proven trustworthy.

268
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,300
You can entrust the tasks in the study to her.

269
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,890
I believe

270
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,680
she can take good care of you.

271
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,840
I see.

272
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,570
You rascal. Trying to slack off?

273
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,010
Alright.

274
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,970
You're by my side day and night.

275
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,910
I'm well aware of your hard work.

276
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,650
Let that little wildcat take over for a few days.

277
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,450
Take a few days off.

278
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,200
Anything else?

279
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,350
I've followed you for many years.

280
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,960
I've never once felt tired.

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,260
If I may speak frankly,

282
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,790
though you're my master,

283
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,450
you're more like an elder brother.

284
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,080
I bear in mind the years of care you've given me.

285
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,600
I want to serve you forever.

286
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,100
But...

287
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,180
I'll make you some tea.

288
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,570
You didn't finish.

289
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,230
It's rare for him to be so emotional.

290
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,060
He even got shy by his own words.

291
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,430
Xiaoqi.

292
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,430
Xiaoqi?

293
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,270
Where's Xiaoqi?

294
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm looking for him too.

295
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,070
He's not here?

296
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,470
Why are you here?

297
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,270
Xiaoqi is really unreasonable.

298
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,710
It was bad enough that he lectured me yesterday.

299
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm good-tempered.

300
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,280
Today,

301
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,110
he actually wrote a long list for me,

302
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,950
telling me to follow it

303
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,990
and take care of you item by item.

304
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,820
Fine.

305
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,470
If I'm doing all the chores,

306
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,530
what's he for then?

307
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,030
See for yourself.

308
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,230
Ms. Su, you've been here for a while.

309
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,990
You're familiar with Young Lord's

310
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,330
daily preferences by now.

311
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,790
For trivial matters in maintaining the study,

312
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,470
I've detailed the instructions.

313
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,590
You must memorize them.

314
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,110
Right?

315
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,710
Take good care of Young Lord.

316
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,960
Please accept my kowtow in gratitude.

317
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,770
Don't move.

318
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:19,830
[Protect and listen to Young Lord]
Don't move.

319
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,750
[Protect and listen to Young Lord]

320
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,240
Only two people know about this secret.
[Protect and listen to Young Lord]

321
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,950
Only two people know about this secret.

322
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,860
From now on, it's still only for two people.

323
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,100
[Isn't there a third person now?]
From now on, it's still only for two people.

324
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,130
[Isn't there a third person now?]

325
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,070
There mustn't be a third person.

326
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,100
Oh no.

327
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,580
Where are you going?

328
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,470
Xiaoqi!

329
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,830
You rascal. What's this for?

330
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,670
Young Lord.

331
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,880
What's going on?

332
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,810
When I first followed you,

333
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,470
you once said

334
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,240
the secret of your hearing is for just two people.

335
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,870
Now...

336
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,880
Su Ruofei is more suitable to be your ears.

337
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,050
So I wanted to emulate

338
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,260
what Steward Wang did...

339
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,030
Emulate?

340
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,320
Emulate his death to show loyalty?

341
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,970
I was still young then.

342
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,830
I only knew he was wholeheartedly protecting me.

343
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,870
But when he decided to die,

344
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,400
I couldn't stop him in time.

345
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,350
Do you know

346
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,350
how many years I've regretted that?

347
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,570
Young Lord.

348
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,590
Didn't you say I'm more like an elder brother

349
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,690
than your master?

350
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,960
Raise your head.

351
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,620
Trust me.

352
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,650
I will protect you.

353
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,030
Like you've protected me all these years.

354
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,190
So...

355
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,030
I don't have to die?

356
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,960
I can accompany you for a lifetime?

357
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,360
But remember this,

358
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,270
no more petty tricks like this again.

359
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,110
You hear me?

360
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,750
Actually, I didn't want to

361
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,190
die just like that.

362
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,350
My greatest wish

363
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,150
is to go through fire and water for you,

364
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,890
die for you...

365
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,710
Stop.

366
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,690
Die for me?

367
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,960
Enough already.

368
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,480
Get rid of all this nonsense.

369
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,630
Also, those days of vacation I promised you

370
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,430
are canceled.

371
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,250
Come to my study after you've cleaned up.

372
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,290
Yes.

373
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,350
These are...

374
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,950
Where is it?

375
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,660
What are you looking for?

376
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,750
What is this?

377
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,010

What's wrong?

564
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,640
I need to keep an eye on you at night.

565
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,350
If there are assassins again,

566
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,430
I can warn you.

567
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,710
Are you okay?

568
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,070
It's nothing.

569
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,270
The tea's too hot.

570
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,670
It's not hot.

571
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,480
Actually,

572
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,540
you don't need to sneak back at night.

573
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,350
That won't do.

574
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,590
You've been so generous

575
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,030
to help me enter the workshop.

576
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,190
How could I abandon you?

577
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,190
Besides,

578
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,510
look at Xiaoqi.

579
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,190
He accompanies you 24 hours a day

580
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,830
without rest.

581
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,710
Look,

582
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,710
he even has white hair.

583
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,150
He's aging so fast.

584
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,310
What a poor youth.

585
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,380
Here, take it back.

586
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,200
So

587
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,800
you need to give him time to breathe.

588
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,360
During the day, he'll accompany you,

589
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,230
and at night, I'll accompany you.

590
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,710
Each with our own duty.

591
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,290
How did I come up with

592
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,830
such a perfect solution?

593
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,990
It is quite good.

594
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,810
Are you finished?

595
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,840
Actually, I was about to say

596
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,880
you don't need to sneak back at night

597
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,270
because I've already instructed Minister Ling.

598
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,440
When the workshop closes,

599
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,110
you don't have to stay there.

600
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,390
I just didn't expect

601
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,310
you to bring it up on your own.

602
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,070
You've arranged everything?

603
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

604
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,280
Then I wouldn't have known

605
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,950
you were worried about me.

606
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,150
Don't be so smug.

607
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,070
I'm just maintaining

608
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,910
my basic principles as a person, that's all.

609
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,100
You... you two...

610
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,110
Why are you looking at me like that?

611
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,190
I'll go practice the qin.

612
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,160
Bye.

613
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,980
Young Lord.

614
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,310
Why are you smiling?

615
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,870
This little wildcat suddenly retracted her claws.

616
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
It's actually quite cute.

617
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,820
What are you smiling about?

618
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,030
Well,

619
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,380
you're enjoying the fruits of your labor.

620
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm happy for you, Young Lord.

621
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,550
This doesn't really count as a fruit.

622
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,150
At most, it's just a flower.

623
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,790
A flower?

624
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,070
Y-Young Lord.

625
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,770
Do I look old to you?

626
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,020
I'd say you do, a little bit.

627
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,520
Zhou Ya said she was checking the Hidden Gem Contest notice.

628
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,980
What's taking her so long?

629
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,250
Chujiu.

630
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,560
Go take a look.

631
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,570
I'm here!

632
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,040
Look at this!

633
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,490
[Hidden Gem Contest]

634
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,550
The notice says
[Hidden Gem Contest]

635
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,450
that if you have a music status,
[Hidden Gem Contest]

636
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,110
that if you have a music status,

637
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,910
you'll get to

638
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,310
register for the workshop again.

639
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,670
It's in three days from now.

640
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,830
The centennial celebration is already over.

641
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,230
Why's there suddenly a Hidden Gem Contest?

642
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,990
I heard this contest

643
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,980
has been a tradition since long ago.

644
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,350
But since everyone

645
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,850
cherished the chance to join the workshop,

646
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,430
no one would wait till this contest.

647
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,160
So over time, it was forgotten.

648
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,150
But this time, Young Lord and Master Jin proposed it

649
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,750
to His Majesty together.

650
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,390
Young Lord and Master Jin?

651
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,130
Hidden Gem Contest?

652
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,750
Could it be that Fei is joining it?

655

[Symphony Workshop]

656
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,710
Here.

657
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,890
Liu Xinnian.

658
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,320
Here.

659
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,670
Wu Wei.

660
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,460
Here.

661
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,600
Huang Ying.

662
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,680
Huang Ying?

663
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,990
Is it her?

664
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,270
Huang Ying.

665
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:09,870
Here!

666
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,200
Why are you so late?

667
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,790
Symphony Workshop is too big.

668
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,330
I got lost by accident.

669
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,060
It's you?

670
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,270
You...

671
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,400
Feng Duoli.

672
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,830
What a coincidence.

673
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,530
Aren't you Young Lord's entertainer?

674
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,530
Why are you

675
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,540
trying to join Symphony Workshop?

676
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,100
It's not for my Jin, is it?

677
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,090
Don't worry.

678
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,130
I do not covet your Jin.

679
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,230
We're just friends.

680
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,430
You can't be friends.

681
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
You're too much.

682
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,100
I've known Shangyu longer than you have.

683
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,500
You're not together.

684
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,680
And even if you were,

685
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,280
we could still be friends.

686
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,930
Fine.

687
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,390
Don't think about staying in Symphony Workshop then.

688
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,560
You're so unreasonable.

689
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,740
I am unreasonable.

690
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,240
Now that everyone is here,

691
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,750
get ready

692
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,810
for the exam.

693
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:10,950
[Quyin Hall]
for the exam.

Young Lord.

696
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,880
if you want to watch,

697
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,160
why don't you just go in?

698
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,560
Why must we hide and peek?

699
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,230
We can't go in and watch.

700
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,470
Su Ruofei's victory

701
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,870
has to look like it was

702
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,380
attained fair and square.

703
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,980
If I went in,

704
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,930
even if Ruofei won,

705
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,750
they'd think

706
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,320
it was because of me

707
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,870
that she made it in.

708
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,910
You're so considerate of her.

709
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,340
But if we keep squatting here,

710
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,270
what if someone discovers us?

711
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,850
It'd damage your dignity.

712
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,430
My dignity

713
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,830
won't be damaged

714
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,090
by such a small matter.

715
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,260
Why are you so talkative today?

716
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Don't disturb me.

721
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,030
to simultaneously play the new piece

722
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,190
we composed,

723
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,960
"Breaking the Formation."

724
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,270
Whoever plays this piece completely

725
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,230
will make it into the workshop.

726
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,630
The same piece?

727
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,760
Isn't that too easy?

728
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,550
Let's begin.

00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,260
[Breaking the Formation]

730
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,280
She wasn't nervous in the first round.

731
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,460
She did well in the second round too.

732
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,650
The third round is quite challenging.

733
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,190
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

734
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,840
Su Ruofei.

00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,390
Huang Ying.

00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,100
Wu Wei.

737
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,390
Liu Xinnian.

738
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,070
Congratulations, you've made it.

739
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,600
-Congrats.

741
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,320
Did Su Ruofei make it?

742
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,910
Is it surprising?

743
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,450
I've long predicted

744
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,650
she would make it.

745
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,290
Shall we go back now?

746
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,890
What did you say?

747
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,820
Shall we go back?

748
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,310
There's still the grouping later.

749
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,310
We'll leave after.

750
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:44,910
Okay.

00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,600
we hide somewhere else?

753
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,470
What's wrong with you today?

754
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,660
Just stay here!

755
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,440
My... my legs are numb.

756
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,950
You think mine aren't?

757
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,480
Bear with it.

758
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,450
Thank you, Minister Ling.

759
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,260
Huang Ying.

760
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,000
Congratulations.

761
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,500
Thank you, Minister Ling.

762
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,950
Congratulations.

763
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,720
-Thank you, Minister Ling.
-Thank you, Minister Ling.

764
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,520
Wait for me.

765
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,220
Fei.

766
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:32,930
Sister!

767
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,190
Why didn't you tell me

768
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,310
about something so major?

769
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,070
I was too busy practicing,

770
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,350
so I forgot to tell you.

771
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,570
Look!

772
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,040
I passed!

773
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,870
That's great.

774
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,510
Now

775
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,620
we can be together.

776
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,920
Hurray!

777
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:49,940
Look!

778
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,140
Ruofei.

779
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,960
Congratulations!

780
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,150
Jin!

781
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,190
Did you miss me?

782
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,630
I can't breathe!

783
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,170
Answer me one question first.

784
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,100
I don't like you.

785
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,640
Liar!

786
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,030
If you don't like me,

787
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,820
why did you ask His Majesty

788
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,320
to hold this Hidden Gem Contest just for me?

789
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,590
Who said this contest was held for you?

790
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,070
Don't deny it.

791
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:15,610
Okay.

792
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,940
You four will form one group.

793
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,970
You'll be the Rhyming Qinghe Group.

794
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,190
Su Ruoshan.

795
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,850
You are hereby granted the title of First-Rank Qingyin.

796
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,180
May you never forget the teachings of our ancestors.

797
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,630
Possess the sincerity of heaven and earth,

798
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,980
attain the virtue of the divine,

799
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,590
and prosper the spirit of all beings.

800
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,310
I, Su Ruoshan, will never forget.

801
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,870
This Su Ruoshan is only 17 years old.

802
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,150
She must be the youngest

803
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,470
Qingyin in Cloud City.

804
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,020
You're wrong.

805
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,190
I heard her sister

806
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,320
got the Qingyin title at the age of ten.

807
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,320
But for some unknown reason,

808
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,050
she suddenly gave up the title.

809
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,140
So her sister's more impressive.
