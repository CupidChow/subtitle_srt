about how Ruofei failed to seduce me

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,460
and got forced back to Cloud City.

110
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,190
You suspect these two matters are related?

111
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,940
Whether they're related or not,

112
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,200
I must make a trip to Cloud City in person.

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,310
If they really intend to use Su Ruofei

114
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,310
to lure you there,

115
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,870
wouldn't you be walking right into their trap?

116
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,870
Please think twice, Your Highness.

117
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,350
I thought that as long as Ruofei left me,

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,610
she could stay away from those schemes and troubles.

119
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,020
But I never expected

120
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,750
Uncle to actually make a move against her.

121
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,840
Since that's the case,

122
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,430
I might as well go there myself

123
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,750
and present them with an even bigger target.

124
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,710
I'd like to see

125
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,670
what other tricks they can come up with.

127
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,030
Select several dozen elites from the secret guards

128
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,960
and ask them to follow me in secret.

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,410
As you command, Your Highness.

130
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,690
As for His Majesty...

131
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,340
This is utter nonsense!

132
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,750
You, a dignified Young Lord,

133
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,200
actually want to chase an arsonist all the way to Cloud City?

134
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,660
Don't even think about it!

135
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,370
Father, please calm down.

136
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,820
Regarding the arson at the Symphony Workshop,

137
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,550
I've already made some progress in investigation.

138
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,090
Although no conclusive evidence has been found,

139
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,190
I'm certain

140
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,090
it wasn't Su Ruofei who did it.

141
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,180
It was because of my momentary hesitation back then

142
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,830
that she was wrongly accused and had to leave.

143
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,610
Now I must clear her name.

144
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,310
Enough!

145
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,870
As the Young Lord,

146
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,530
you must always remember your position.

147
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,750
Your every word and action

148
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,040
must not be reckless or arbitrary,

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,380
including the person you marry.

150
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,990
Everything must be befitting of your status.

151
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,050
Only then will the people be convinced and submissive.

152
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,450
Don't forget that

153
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,450
you still have the marriage arrangement I bestowed upon you.

154
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,480
His Majesty insists on arranging a marriage for you.

155
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,680
His Majesty insists on making me leave.

156
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,630
So you have no choice!

157
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,750
Father.

158
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,110
As you just said,

159
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,290
since I am the Young Lord,

160
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,130
the person I marry should match my status.

161
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,630
But what if I were to give up my position as Young Lord?

162
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,070
What did you just say?

163
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,710
Father.

164
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,080
I must go to Cloud City.

165
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,940
If you insist on making me marry someone else,

166
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,110
you might as well just strip me of

167
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,430
my title as Young Lord.

168
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,110
I'm willing to be an ordinary person

169
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,810
and live freely in the mountains with the one I love,

170
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,520
as a normal couple.

171
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,270

What brings you two here?

182
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,990
Your Highness,

183
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,190
we have been cleaning

184
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,420
and repairing the instrument room recently.

185
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,720
We found something weird.

186
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
We specially brought it here to you.

187
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,030
What's this?

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,930
This should be the wax left after

189
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,930
a candle burned out.

190
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,390
But most of it seems to have been scraped away.

191
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,910
Right.

192
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,810
We never use candles in the instrument room.

193
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,390
We thought

194
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,090
this must be the evidence left by the arsonist.

195
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,820
So we specially brought it to you, Your Highness.

196
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,140
This is great evidence.

197
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,500
I was just about to go to Cloud City to find Ruofei.

198
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,230
Let me thank you both on her behalf.

199
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,870
Really?

200
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,110
Are you going to bring Ruofei back here?

201
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,950
I'm going to stay there with her.

202
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,350
Saddle up. We're heading to Cloud City.

203
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,410
-Stay there?
-Yes.

204
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,030
See you.

205
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,300
[Notice]

206
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,320
[Green Flash Workshop is recruiting. Only requirement: True passion for music. No other restrictions.]

207
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,930
The notice has been posted for several days,

208
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,460
but no one has come to apply.

209
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,000
It must have been affected by the rumors.

210
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,560
It seems that the rumor

211
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,450
was spread by someone with malicious intent.

212
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,140
Who else could it be?

213
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,100
It seems that even though you left Symphony City,

214
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,390
there are still people who can't stand to see you doing well.

215
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,150
Who is it?

216
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,160
Who's deliberately making things difficult for Fei?

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,450
Who? Who is it?

218
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,040
Who?

219
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,440
What we should do is think carefully about

220
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,640
how to attract people to come and apply.

221
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,250

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,480
Congratulations, My Lord. You've got what you want.

223
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,180
Congratulations, My Lord. You've got what you want.

224
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,860
It's because your strategy worked, Shanshan.

225
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,060
Yun Mu actually returned to Cloud City.

226
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,010
Everyone has always thought that Young Lord was a playboy,

227
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,080
but they didn't know he could be so devoted.

228
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,260
To think he would travel thousands of miles

229
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,300
for his loved one.

230
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,190
Whether he's a playboy or a faithful man,

231
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,780
as long as he dares to set foot in Cloud City,

232
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,430
I won't let him leave alive.

234
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,710

I saw a lot of people.
[Green Flash Workshop]

238
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:14,790
I saw a lot of people.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,550
I guess they're here to apply.

240
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,810
Hurry up and get ready.

241
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,550
What kind of place is this?

242
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,480
This... This...

243
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,710
I don't think they're here to apply.

244
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,440
It looks more like they're here to cause trouble.

245
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,960
[Green Flash Workshop]

246
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,460
Look, it's Master Jin.
[Green Flash Workshop]

247
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,860
I didn't lie to you, did I?

[Green Flash Workshop]

249
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,630
Master Jin is right here.
[Green Flash Workshop]

250
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,830
Master Jin is really here.
[Green Flash Workshop]

251
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,710
Master Jin is really here.

252
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,390
It's really him.

253
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,950
Why did he come to a place like this?

254
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,230
Exactly.

255
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,710
It is rumored that Master Jin has been traveling all over the world.

256
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,880
I didn't expect him to actually join

257
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,240
this notorious Green Flash Workshop.

258
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,800
Nonsense! What did you say?

259
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,630
I think it must be this Su Ruofei

260
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,230
who failed to seduce the Young Lord

261
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,070
that bewitched Master Jin.

262
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,470
Master Jin.

263
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,020
Don't be fooled by this woman.

264
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,740
You...

265
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,990
Watch your mouth.

266
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,430
Master Jin.

267
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,430
I'm the boss of No-Time Workshop in Wushuang City.

268
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,420
Seeing you here today,

269
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,430
I'd like to specially invite you to join us.

270
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,350
The Green Flash Workshop is truly garbage

271
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,550
and not worthy of you.

272
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,150
I...

273
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,820
Master Jin.

274
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm the boss of Rosy Cloud Workshop in Zhuque City.

275
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,510
We've specially come to invite you to join us, Master Jin.

276
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,790
Master Jin, we're short-staffed too.

You're all familiar with music theory,

281
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,220
You're all familiar with music theory,

282
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,870
and you're supposed to be sensitive and discerning.

283
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,730
You should be able to distinguish right from wrong.

284
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,360
I didn't expect that you'd believe the rumors so easily

285
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,590
and still act so righteous.

286
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,070
I...

287
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,750
This...

288
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,470
This is really ridiculous to me.

289
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,630
Why can't Master Jin join us?

290
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,270
Everyone.

291
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,620
If you are here

292
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,120
to join Green Flash Workshop,

293
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,580
you're more than welcome.

294
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,750
But if you're just here

295
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,610
to cause trouble and make a scene,

296
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,030
then please go back

297
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,730
to wherever you came from.

298
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,620
What kind of nonsense is that?

299
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,500
Who'd want to join them?

300
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,710

How about it?

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,270
No one wants to join you, right?

is none of your concern.

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,040
You're determined to cause trouble, aren't you?

352
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,980
I'm determined to stay.

But our workshop's musician quota

356
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,130
is full.

357
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,630
There's only one vacancy for a music apprentice,

358
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,170
who's responsible for chopping wood, sweeping,

359
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,290
serving tea,

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,320

361
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,270
I wonder if you'd deign to do this, Your Highness?

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,430
What kind of talk is this?

363
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,190
Okay, no problem.

367
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,950
I'll be your little music apprentice.

368
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,150
Young Lord has even joined the Green Flash Workshop.

369
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,210
It seems the rumor is false after all.

370
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,150
Xiaoqi.

371
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,920
Why are you smiling?

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,330
Smiling is not allowed.

373
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,950
Tell me.

374
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,860
What are you here for?

375
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,430
Ruofei.

376
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,930
I know I hurt you before...

377
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,300
Stop right there.

378
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,310
I don't want to talk about what happened in Symphony City anymore.

379
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,620
I've already forgotten

380
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,310
everything about you before.

381
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,310
If you're here for those things,

382
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,630
please leave.

383
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,050
Please calm down, Madam.

384
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,070
Actually, after I arrived in Cloud City,

385
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,880
I heard some unfavorable rumors about you, Madam.

386
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,650
Since you want to revitalize the workshop,

387
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,580
why not let me stay for a while longer?

388
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,440
That way, those rumors will naturally be dispelled.

389
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,870
For the entire workshop,

390
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,470
it would be all benefit and no harm.

391
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,780
Young Lord isn't really

392
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,110
going to be a music apprentice here, is he?

393
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,070
Alright then.

394
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,620
Since you want to be a music apprentice so bad,

395
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,910
I'll grant your wish.

396
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,550
However, being a music apprentice at our Green Flash Workshop

397
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,780
isn't easy.

398
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,590
Especially for someone like you,

399
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,750
a pampered Young Lord.

400
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,360
I...

401
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm all ears, Madam.

402
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,820
First,

403
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,300
you have to get up between 5 to 7 am every day,

404
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,270
boil water, chop firewood, and cook,

405
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,780
because you're responsible for everyone's three meals a day.

406
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,220
Okay, no problem.

407
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,800
Second,

408
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,270
when everyone else is practicing their instruments,

409
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,530
you're in charge of serving tea.

410
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,030
When everyone else is taking a break,

411
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,300
you're responsible for cleaning the instruments.

412
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,080
When everyone else is sleeping,

413
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,860
you're responsible for cleaning every room in this workshop,

414
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,570
as well as

415
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,430
every tree in this courtyard.

416
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,530
And you have to do this every day.

417
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,880
Alright, no problem.

418
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,950
Then I'll start learning today.

419
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,230
Is she really going to make Young Lord do all this?

420
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,090
I wonder if you have any other arrangements, Madam.

421
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,180
Besides,

422
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,330
you must complete all these tasks yourself.

423
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,350
You're not allowed to hire any help.

424
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,190
Oh, right.

425
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,840
All the rooms here are full.

426
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,190
You can only sleep in the courtyard.

427
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,960
Are you willing to do that?

428
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,150
Of course I am.

429
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,990
I don't have much experience as a music apprentice.

430
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,590
I'm lucky enough

431
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,900
that you're willing to take me in, Madam.

432
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,960
Of course I'm willing to do anything.

433
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,710
Good.

434
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,470
Very good.

435
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,110
From now on,

436
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,190
you, as a music apprentice, will be called Mu.

437
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,310
Mu.

438
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,230
Then I, Mu, thank you for giving me this name, Madam.

439
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,590
He's the Young Lord.

440
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,470
Exactly.

441
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,270
How can we call the Young Lord Mu?

442
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,070
He agreed to all that?

443
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,030
Alright.

444
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,660
Is there anything else?

445
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,070
Then go do your work.

446
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,820
Yes.

447
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,720
Also,

448
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,200
don't

449
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,240
wander around in front of me today.

450
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
I don't want to see your face.

451
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,710
Okay.

452
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,250
It's just I don't know where the vegetable garden is.

454
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,180
Show him to the vegetable garden.

455
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,680
Okay.

456
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,600
Your Highness, please.

457
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,490
Please call me Mu.

458
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,310
Thank you.

-Call him Mu.

Please.

Alright, thank you.

00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,010
What are your plans next?

464
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,650
Are you really going to let him stay?

465
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,870
I want to see

466
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,510
what he's up to.

467
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,790
By the way,

468
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,740
take down that notice.

469
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,790
His status is special,

470
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,300
and there are many prying eyes around.

471
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,900

Well, Master Jin.

475
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,890
Are we really going to call him Mu?

476
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,550
Do as Fei says.

477
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,130
But he's Young... Young Lord.

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,070
We...

479
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,730
So what if he's the Young Lord?

480
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,460
In Symphony City,

481
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
he bullied your dear Fei quite a lot.

482
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,580
Let's take this opportunity

483
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,830
to settle old scores and get revenge.

484
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,670
He dared to bully Fei?

485
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,710
We'll definitely make him suffer.

486
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,430
Yes. Let's go get even with him.

487
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,750
-In the vegetable garden.
-Right.

-Where’s my hoe?
-Speaking of your hoe,

489
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,510
where... Where's my sickle?

490

I'll let myself in.

Who allowed you to come in?

495
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,540
Get out.

00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,350
I don't know what's wrong with them,

553
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,500
but they suddenly seem possessed.

554
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Biao keeps saying he's a frog.

555
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,990
He's usually the most talkative,

556
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,390
but now he can only croak.

557
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,670
Monkey is even scarier.

558
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,270
He's been reciting poetry since he finished eating.

559
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,330
And he suddenly stopped stuttering.

560
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,170
This is quite cute, isn't it?

561
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,470
When did they start acting like this?

562
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,830
About a quarter of an hour after lunch.

563
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,540
Lunch...

564
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,450
Did you two have lunch?

565
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,750
I haven't had time to eat yet.

566
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,600
Is what Mu made even edible?

567
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,630
I have no appetite.

568
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,550
What about Shangyu? Did Shangyu eat it?

569
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,460
Don't worry.

570
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,530
Since it was Mu's cooking,

571
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,260
he definitely wouldn't eat it.

572
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,710
I delivered Master Jin's meal to him.

573
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,590
I forgot to tell him

574
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,250
that it was made by Young Lord.

575
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,660
I'll keep an eye on these two.

576
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,470
Go get Yun Mu.

577
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,150
Okay.

578
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,000
Jin!

579
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,970
Biao!

580
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,260
Biao!

581
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,160
Jin!

582
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,800
You didn't eat all this food, did you?

583
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,310
Jin?

584
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,690
Are you alright, Jin?

585
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,810
Are you okay, Jin?

586
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,950
Stop talking.

587
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,110
Pipa.

588
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,610
Play it.

589
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,340
Hurry up!

590
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,650
Okay, okay, okay.

591
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,600
Jin!

592
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,960
Are you okay?

593
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,750
Don't stop.

594
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,630
Jin.

595
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,350
Are you okay, Jin?

596
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,970
-Stop it.
-Let go of me!

597
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,060
Mortals must not profane this deity.

598
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,390
Stop... Stop it.

599
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,250
So annoying!

600
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,330
Don't touch me!

601
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,700
This won't do. Come here!

602
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,910
Let's go.

603
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,510
Come on, let's go.

604
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,460
You...

605
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,930
Poisonous weeds?

606
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,290
You mean these are poisonous weeds?

607
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,370
How are they different from wild vegetables?

608
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,950
This thing is called daylily.

609
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,310
When I was little and went herb-picking with my father,

610
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,240
he taught me that

611
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,020
this weed is highly toxic.

612
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,320
It's hallucinogenic,

613
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,840
and it can cause drastic changes in behavior for those who accidentally ingest it,

614
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,370
making them act completely out of character.

615
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,250
What's wrong?

616
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,910
Do you want to be poisoned too?

617
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,210
We don't have time to take care of you as well.

618
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,370
So is this poison life-threatening?

619
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,790
Do we need to call a doctor?

620
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,570
Don't worry.

621
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,810
There is actually a kind of herb that can detoxify this poison.

622
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,150
Its name is woad.

623
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,270
When I was little, my father and I

624
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,330
saw it once in the Green Flash Forest.

625
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,770
Unfortunately, while it thrives in warm temperatures and can withstand cold,

626
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,480
this herb is particularly susceptible to flooding.

627
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,040
It's very rare in our waterside Cloud City,

628
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,010
and it's quite difficult to find.

629
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,150
Woad...

630
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,230
Woad...

631
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,130
Eleven.

632
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,830
Can you draw it for me?

633
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,270
I'll go to the mountains and look for it.

634
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,090
Alright.

635
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,190
Forget it.

636
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,890
You don't even know the difference between grains.

637
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,990
You can't even distinguish poisonous weeds from wild vegetables.

638
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,360
You've only been here for less than a day, and you've already got people poisoned.

639
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,460
Green Flash Workshop can't afford

640
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,300
to have a music apprentice like this.

641
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,080
You should leave.

642
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,160
No, Madam.

643
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,700
I can learn to distinguish between grains.

644
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,990
I can practice to improve my cooking skills.

645
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,180
I'm willing to accept the punishment for getting them poisoned.

646
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,380
But it's not okay if you want me to leave.

647
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,210
As long as you stay in Cloud City for one day,

648
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,600
I must stay here.

649
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,560
You are the esteemed Young Lord.

650
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,020
You surely can't stay here forever, can you?

651
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,450
Then I may as well give up my position as the Young Lord.

652
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,970
Young Lord.

653
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,610
You said you'd give up your position as the Young Lord?

654
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,860
You believe what he said?

655
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,760
If what he said was credible,

656
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I wouldn't be in this situation now.

657
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,440
Madam.

658
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,470
Fei is really...

659
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,650
I told you not to call me Young Lord.

660
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,640
Call me Mu.

661
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,860
Okay, Mu.

662
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,990
But I still need to trouble you

663
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,300
to draw it as soon as possible.

664
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,900
Alright, I'll go draw it now.

665
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,520
Here's the drawing of the herb.

666
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,690
Mu.

667
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,480
Are you really going by yourself?

668
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,580
I'll leave things here to you.

669
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,820
After I find the herb,

670
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,750
I'll come back as soon as possible.

671
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
This herb is very rare.

672
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,930
It may not be easy to find.

673
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,280
Please be very careful.

674
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,130
Don't worry.

675
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
With this drawing,

676
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,220
I definitely won't make a mistake.

677
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,830
Oh, right.

678
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,250
How are they doing now?

679
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,980
The woad my father brought back years ago

680
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,840
was dried and ground into powder.

681
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,150
But now

682
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,730
there's only a little bit left.

683
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,260
It's only enough to make one dose of decoction.

684
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,900
I've already sent it to Master Jin.

685
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,960
Huang Ying will make sure he takes it.

686
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,190
As for Monkey and Biao,

687
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,710
they've worn themselves out.

688
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,540
Fei has taken them back to their rooms to rest.

689
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,700
They should be fine.

690
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,070
However, you'd better

691
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,520
bring back the herb before dark.

692
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,660
Otherwise, if it takes too long,

693
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,590
I'm afraid even if the poison is detoxified, it'll still cause damage.

694
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,490
Don't worry.

695
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,460
I'll definitely be back before dark.

696
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,020
Okay.

697
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,120
Your Highness.

698
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,920
Let me go for you instead.

699
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,570
Have you forgotten your own task?

700
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,900
Nothing

701
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,650
is more important than the safety of this forest.

702
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,610
Have you made all the arrangements

703
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,870
in the forest as I instructed?

704
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,530
Please rest assured.

705
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,480
Everything has been arranged properly.

706
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,760
The secret guards have been divided into two shifts,

707
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,540
guarding day and night.

708
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,330
Hidden bells have also been placed around the forest.

709
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,430
If there's any movement,

710
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,230
the bells will ring as a warning.

711
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,150
Well done.

712
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:42,780
Also,

713
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,910
add more manpower

714
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,650
to monitor the Mayor's Mansion day and night.

715
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,840
Report to me immediately if there's any unusual activity.

716
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,700
Your Highness.

717
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,740
You're still trying to distract me, aren't you?

718
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,230
Since I'm already here,

719
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,060
I must ensure their safety.

720
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,860
Xiaoqi.

721
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,920
This is an order.

722
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,990
[Green Flash Workshop]

723
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,850
Your Highness.

[Green Flash Workshop]

725
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,390
I hope Mu can find the herb successfully.
[Green Flash Workshop]

726
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:12,780
I hope Mu can find the herb successfully.

727
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,790
He really went by himself?

728
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,760
Yes.

729
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,760
He went alone.

730
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,870
Alone...

731
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,510
The noble Young Lord of Dongsheng

732
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,630
has been treated as a common servant by you all

733
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,360
since he came here.

734
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,330
He never said a single word of complaint.

735
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,950
Now, because of Young Lord's unintentional mistake,

736
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,020
they got poisoned.

737
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,340
With Young Lord's proud character,

738
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,070
he must be very regretful.

739
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,470
That's why he insisted on going by himself.

740
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,980
I already told him

741
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,220
that he didn't have to go.

742
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,260
I would go myself.

743
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,210
You... Why didn't you stop him?

744
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,990
You know very well that Young Lord's ears...

745
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,430
That Young Lord's condition is special.

746
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,370
How dangerous it is for him to go out alone.

747
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,100
How can you say such things now?

748
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,960
Are you completely heartless?

749
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,700
Fei, where are you going?

750
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,260
This guy is good for nothing.

751
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,110
What if he can't find the antidote

752
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,690
and delays Monkey and the others' detoxification?

753
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,020
I'll go and check on him.

754
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,230
But I've already given Mu the drawing.

755
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,630
At least she still has some conscience.

756
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,940
You insolent commoner!

757
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,060
Do you know I'm the Heavenly Master of the Long Zither,

758
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,270
the one who oversees the world's top musicians...

759
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,270
Here. Here.

760
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,150
All right. Alll right.

761
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,300
Heavenly Master of the Long Zither.

762
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,230
Calm down now.

763
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,690
Take your medicine, okay?

764
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,510
This...

765
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,430
It's so bitter!

766
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,690
What is this medicine?

767
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,490
You can't waste it no matter what.

768
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,300
This is the last bowl we've got left.

769
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,900
Mu went to pick herbs,

770
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,890
and we don't know when he'll be back.

771
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,820
I refuse to consume

772
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,020
such distasteful and vulgar medicine.

773
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,190
Let me tell you.

774
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,510
You'll have to drink this today,

775
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,820
whether you like it or not.

776
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,430
Come on.

777
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,890
Open your mouth.

778
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,880
Open your mouth.

779
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,380
Drink it.

780
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,600
Swallow it, quick.

781
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,580
You...

782
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,700
Fine.

783
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Don't blame me for using force then.

784
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,000
Can you swallow it now?

785
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,830
It tastes pretty good.

786
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,470
I'd like another sip.

787
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Little Devil!

788
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,190
I almost forgot he can't hear.

789
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,270
He can't hear,

790
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,990
yet he insisted on coming out here alone.

791
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,770
He's just trying to cause trouble.

792
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,610
This is all of his own will.

793
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,250
Besides, he caused trouble himself in the first place.

794
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,110
He deserves it.

795
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,510
Little Devil!

796
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,100
Where on earth did he go?

797
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,850
What if he encounters a venomous snake like I did?

798
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,550
Report.

799
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,770
Hidden bell mechanism detected ahead.

800
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,510
Let's go check it out.

801
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,470
Ruofei.

802
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,090
Ruofei.

803
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,510
Why are you here?

804
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,910
I...

805
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,610
Were you worried about me?

806
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,980
Don't think too much.

807
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,630
Even though you've been cold towards me,

808
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,980
you still care about me deep down, don't you?

809
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,510
I was just worried that you couldn't find the herb

810
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,910
and you'd get yourself lost.

811
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,030
It's just Monkey and Biao

812
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,640
haven't been detoxified yet.

813
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,170
I don't want to bear

814
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,350
the grave sin of murdering the Young Lord on top of that.

815
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,230
I was forced.

816
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,510
Did you find the herb?

817
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,400
Look.

818
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,680
What are you waiting for then?

819
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,710
Monkey and Biao

820
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,330
are still waiting for us to go back and save them.

821
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,130
Let's go back.

822
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,190
Wait for me.

823
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,040
Wait for me.

824
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,550
Go.

825
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,380
Notify our men to retreat.

826
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,250
Don't alert the enemy.

827
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,980
-Yes.
-Yes.

828
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,430
[Green Flash Workshop]

829
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,430
We found the herb.
[Green Flash Workshop]

830
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,760
Come out and take a look.
[Green Flash Workshop]

831
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:37,890
[Green Flash Workshop]

832
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,150
You found the herb?

833
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,210
Let me see.

834
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,440
Look, is this it?

835
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,590
That's right.

836
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,510
This is it.

837
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,120
Mu.

838
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,860
What does that herb you used for cooking look like?

839
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,300
Where did you get it?

840
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,370
What?

841
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,060
You want to try it again?

842
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,750
No, no.

843
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,300
Of course not.

844
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:23,880
You,

845
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,990
come with me.

846
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,910
Eleven, here.

847
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,590
Okay.

848
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,550
What's your real purpose of coming to Cloud City?

849
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,430
You've already hurt Ruofei once.

850
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,990
I won't allow it to happen again.

851
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,440
I came here this time

852
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,510
to stay

853
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,230
by Ruofei's side

854
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,490
and prevent her from getting hurt again.

855
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,280
It was because you didn't believe her

856
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,390
that she was wrongfully imprisoned

857
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,230
and expelled from the Symphony Workshop.

858
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,830
Now you tell me you're here to protect her?

859
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,840
I've never doubted her.

860
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,660
It's just there wasn't enough evidence at that time.

861
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,320
We couldn't conclude it was Su Ruoshan's doing.

862
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,990
What about the arranged marriage then?

863
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,900
The arranged marriage was my father's doing.

864
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,030
He had his own considerations.

865
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,710
I argued with him about it later,

866
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,310
but it didn't lead anywhere.

867
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,760
So according to you,

868
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,080
all the mistakes were made by others,

869
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,390
and you have nothing to do with anything, is that right?

870
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:33,740
No.

871
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,360
Of course I made my own mistakes.

872
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,270
My mistake was that I only cared about myself

873
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,070
and ignored Ruofei's feelings.

874
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,270
I always thought

875
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,190
that as long as she left me,

876
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,380
she could stay away from those dangers.

877
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,240
What dangers?

878
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,930
Mr. Jin, you've been in this world for a long time.

879
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,990
Things like struggling for power and status

880
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,230
and brothers turning against each other

881
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,590
shouldn't be new to you.

882
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,630
If Ruofei had stayed by my side,

883
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,800
she could have been implicated.

884
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,330
That's why I chose to let her leave.

885
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,630
Then why did you come to find her?

886
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,910
To be honest,

887
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,350
before I came,

888
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,060
I had already resigned from my position as Young Lord to His Majesty,

889
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,420
and I turned down the arranged marriage.

890
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,260
I just want to be by her side,

891
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,500
even if as an ordinary person.

892
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,030
This is the future I wish for.

893
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,700
If you don't believe me, Mr. Jin,

894
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,830
you can kill me right now.

895
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,820
I can trust you this once.

896
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,360
But if I find out

897
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,100
that you're hiding anything from me,

898
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,500
I won't let you go easily.

899
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,110
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

900
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,010
You don't need to thank me.

901
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,610
Even if you had your reasons,

902
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,830
you can't undo

903
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,370
the pain you caused Su Ruofei.

904
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,430
She may seem carefree on the outside,

905
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,360
but when her feelings are hurt,

906
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,990
she doesn't forgive easily.

907
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,920
I understand everything you said.

908
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,150
It was only when she really left that I realized

909
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,670
nothing in this vast world,

910
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,230
could compare to her smile.

911
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,710
As long as I can be by her side,

912
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,620
even if it's just to help her carry instruments,

913
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,060
or be a small attendant,

914
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,220
I'm willing to do it.

915
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,360
I didn't expect that

916
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,220
Little Devil's feelings for you are quite sincere.

917
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,500
So what?

918
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,240
In this world, sincerity without trust

919
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,230
means nothing.

920
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,400
Moreover, he's still the one from back then.

921
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,650
