00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,310
I didn't expect she would rather die

4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,670
than reveal the secret of your ears.

5
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,410
Since she has proven her loyalty,

6
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,370
I can start training her to use the secret codes.

7
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,950
However,

8
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,950
I only asked you to test her a little.

9
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,750
But you

10
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,470
actually injured her.

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,230
I was just trying to make it more real,

12
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,760
so I pressured her a bit.

13
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm guilty.

14

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,600
It's my fault, too.

16

Go.

18
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,830
Go to the imperial doctor and get some of the best medicine for wounds.

19

20

24

didn't you promise me yesterday

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,390
that we'd start practicing so I could be your little ears today?

26
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,020

it can treat external injuries without leaving scars.

It can promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis.

I thought I'd help you apply it so you could heal in a few days.

170

Mr. Jin, you've never been one to fuss over minor details,

171
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,110
but barging into my bedchamber

172
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,270
is extremely disrespectful.

continue to host you in my mansion.

175
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,560
It's my fault this time.

176
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,110
I apologize to you here, Young Lord.

177

However, although Ruofei is your private entertainer,

Aren't you afraid of ruining her reputation?

181

Moreover,

182
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,550
since Ruofei moved into the Young Lord's Mansion,

183
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,110
she's either been injured or frightened.

184
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,570
It seems that her life here

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,730
is not as pleasant as it should be.

186
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,740
Sir, are you criticizing me

187
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,660
about how I treat my own people?

188
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,400
Your own people?

189
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,410
It seems Ruofei…

190
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,890
has never been yours, has she?

191
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,460
Let's talk this through calmly.

192
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,600
It's not a big deal.

193
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,000
Shangyu.

194
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,630
There's nothing between the Young Lord and me.

195
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,230
He was just helping me apply medicine here.

196
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,160
Young Lord.

197
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,510
Shangyu is my best friend.

198
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,510
He might've been overly concerned about me,

199
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,240
so he didn't mean to offend you.

200
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,240
This doesn't concern you.

201
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,660
Go back and lie down.

202
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,270
Xiaoqi.

203
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,720
Yes, Young Lord?

204
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,990
Escort Mr. Jin back to the Symphony Workshop.

205

[The Daylily Courtyard for a Long Time]

206
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,200
Mr. Jin, please.

207
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,930
Ruofei.

208
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,070
Take good rest.

209
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,350
I'll come to see you another day.

210
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,190
I'll see him off.

211
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,950
Come back.

212
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,390
I just said,

213
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,860
go back and lie down.

214
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,360
Apply the medicine yourself from now on.

215
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,090
Young Lord.

216
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,780
Young Lord.

217
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,110
Mr. Jin has already left.

218
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,510
I wanted to see him off, but he didn't let me.

219
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,670
Pass down the order.

220
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,150
If Jin Shangyu comes to see Su Ruofei again,

221
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,760
do everything you can to stop or block him.

222
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,020
W-Why?

223
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,230
He's trying to get my person.

224
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,110
Isn't this reason enough?

225
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,030
Your person?

226
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,940
Su Ruofei?

227
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,690
Young Lord…

228
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,230
Something's not right…

229
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,770
The Young Lord's behavior is definitely not normal.

230
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,910
I think I've seen it in my novels.

231
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,320
I need to go back and check.

232
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,230
[Symphony Workshop]

233
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
What exquisite konghou skills!

234
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,510
This trip was worth it.

235
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,640
Really impressive.

236
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,510
Ms. Su

237
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,990
was personally received by Madam Yaoshan.

238
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,630
How could this year's Flowing Stream Musical Gathering

239
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,360
be without her participation?

240
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,360
Mr. Dai, I think you want to invite Ms. Su

241
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,150
to attend the gathering with you, right?

242
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,670
Mr. Xu, don't you want to?

243
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,790
Of course not.

244
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,590
I can't stand

245
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,310
your hypocrisy the most.

246
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,670
What are you arguing about here?

247
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,270
Can't you hear Shanshan playing the konghou?

248
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,030
When she's playing,

249
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,890
she doesn't like to be disturbed.

250
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,950
Greetings, Mayor of Cloud City.

251
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,350
What are you doing here?

252
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,200
Mayor,

253
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,110
for this year's Flowing Stream Musical Gathering at the Symphony Workshop,

254
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,310
we specially came to invite Ms. Su to attend.

255
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,640
Who do you think you are?

256
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,990
With me, the mayor, here,

257
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,110
how could it be your turn to invite Shanshan?

258
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,970
Get out of here!

259
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,750
-Yes.
-Yes.

260
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,710
Let's go.

261
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,630
I knew it.

262
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,120
Many people would covet my Shanshan.

263
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,360
Fortunately, I came prepared.

264
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,270
Come on, give it to me.

265
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,400
Here you are, Mayor.

266
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,030
Stay here and keep watch.

267
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,870
Don't let anyone in.

268
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,350
Yes.

269
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,920
Shanshan.

270
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,710
Have you finished practicing your konghou?

271
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,820
May I come in?

272
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,510
Shanshan.

273
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,490
Shanshan.

274
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,590
-I heard you practicing.
-Mayor.

275
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,050
I didn't dare to disturb you.

276
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,430
I even waited for you at the door for a while.

277
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,490
Come on. Come here.

278
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,810
Take a look at this.

279
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,550
I found the best embroidery workshop in Symphony City

280
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,740
and had a set of embroidered clothes made for you.

281
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,910
See if you like it.

282
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,070
Come on. Have a seat.

283
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,080
Mayor, there's no need for such extravagance.

284
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
I've told you before

285
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,970
I don't lack anything here.

286
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,200
Besides, these embroidered clothes are clearly costly.

287
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,700
I can't accept such a gift.

288
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,390
In a few days, the Symphony Workshop

289
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,460
will hold the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering.

290
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,030
You'll definitely need this.

291
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,830
Keep it.

292
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,700
Oh, right.

293
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,060
I also had a Cloud City–style carriage

294
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,150
made for you.

295
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,150
It will be ready in a while.

296
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,340
I'll have it delivered to you directly.

297
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,990
By the way,

298
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,670
are you comfortable in this residence?

299
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,350
I can buy another house for you

300
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,670
near the Symphony Workshop.

301
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,750
Mayor, please don't worry.

302
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,950
I'm quite comfortable living here in the Symphony Workshop.

303
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,870
Well then, you can't refuse the carriage.

304
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,070
It will be ready soon.

305
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,750
Then, thank you, Mayor.

306
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,040
I will certainly perform well

307
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,270
and showcase the elegance

308
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,030
of our Cloud City musicians to everyone.

309
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,180
Of course.

310
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,960
When you stand there,

311
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,530
you'll definitely be the most outstanding.

312
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,220
Oh, Shanshan,

313
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,870
do you know what the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering is for?

314
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,670
I heard it was a grand music event

315
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,070
held by Madam Yaoshan

316
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,130
after she became the music minister.

317
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,490
It's more than that.

318
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,690
I've inquired about it in detail.

319
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,170
In previous years, many musicians

320
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,750
start a relationship through music pairing at this gathering.

321
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,110
So, I came to ask you

322
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,950
what piece you'll play by then.

323
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,950
I'll play a piece to respond to yours.

324
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,150
Mayor, your hands are meant for battling enemies,

325
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,000
not for playing musical instruments.

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,430
Why lower yourself to this?

327
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,990
No, no, it's not lowering myself.

328
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,320
Don't worry, Shanshan.

329
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,710
I've already found some teachers.

330
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,240
I will practice diligently

331
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,470
and won't embarrass you in front of everyone.

332
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,590
No, Mayor.

333
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,150
-I...
-Alright.

334
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,750
I won't disturb your practice anymore.

335
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,310
I should go back and practice as well.

336
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,670
You don't need to see me out.

337
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,130
Let's see each other at the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering.

338
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,990
Don't see me out. Don't.

339
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,520
-Keep practicing.
-Mayor.

340
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm leaving.

341
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,560
I wonder if the Young Lord will attend the gathering.

342
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,910
Does he only feel gratitude towards that jasper girl

343
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,960
and nothing else?

344
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,050
No matter what,

345
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,140
that jasper girl holds a special place

346
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,370
in his heart.

347
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,070
At this gathering,

348
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,270
I must match my music with his.

349
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,330
Only then can we get closer.

350
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,220
[Young Lord's Mansion]

352
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400

355

Shangyu.

356
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,230
Why are you sneaking around secretly?

357
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,440
The Young Lord ordered

358
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,710
to prevent me from seeing you,

359
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,950
so I had to sneak in by climbing over the wall.

360
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,170
Prevent you from seeing me?

361
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:29,810
Why?

362
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,160
Never mind. Let's not talk about that.

363
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,670
Ruofei,

364
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,250
I recently looked at a house.

365
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,080
The scenery is beautiful, and the environment is elegant.

366
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,170
I've bought it.

367
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,810
Will you leave with me?

368
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,790
Leave with you?

369
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,070
Or, if you don't want to stay in Symphony City,

370
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,870
I can take you back to Cloud City.

371
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,480
Or, wherever you want to go,

372
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,640
I can take you there.

373
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,310
Thank you, Shangyu.

374
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,790
But I can't leave with you.

375
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,860
W-why not?

376
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,410
Do you really want to be his entertainer?

377
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,600
I don't just want to be an entertainer.

378
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,580
I am...

379
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,510
I can't tell him about the ear thing.

380
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,600
Anyway, I have my reasons for staying.

381
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Oh, and the Young Lord promised me,

382
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,550
as long as I perform well as his entertainer,

383
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,340
he will help me restore my music status

384
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,610
and enter the Symphony Workshop.

385
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,750
Symphony Workshop?

386
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,070
I remember you always hated

387
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,310
those official workshops.

388
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,420
But the Symphony Workshop is not an ordinary official workshop.

389
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,110
Not only do I want to enter the Symphony Workshop,

390
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,350
but I also want to become the music minister.

391
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,480
The music minister?

392
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,510
Why?

393
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,000
Because once I become the music minister,

394
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,150
I can change

395
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,070
those annoying systems.

396
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,230
Talented musicians

397
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,630
like Monkey, Eleven, and Biao

398
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,150
won't be discriminated against anymore.

399
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,820
They will be respected instead.

400
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,350
Moreover, the private workshops

401
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,790
can be on equal footing with official workshops.

402
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,350
I just hope those who think they're above others

403
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,150
and are so full of themselves can realize

404
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,480
that music is not just about lofty ideals.

405
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,110
It should be more about bringing joy to people.

406
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,730
Since you have such ambitions,

407
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,950
I'll wait for you at the Symphony Workshop.

408
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,550
Alright.

409
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,110
But are you sure

410
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,670
the Young Lord will keep his promise?

411
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,780
Don't worry.

412
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,850
The Young Lord made a promise to me.

413
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,420
Besides, he still needs something from me.

414
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,540
Okay.

415
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,060
Someone's coming. I have to go now.

416
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,120
-Take care.
-Okay.

417
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,840
What are you doing here?

418
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,990
I was just feeling a bit tired from practicing,

419
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,550
so I'm taking a break here.

420
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,590
What instructions do you have, Young Lord?

421
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,190
I've thought of a new method.

422
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,790
It can also test

423
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,120
the results of your recent practice with the bell language.

427
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,960

Later, I will blindfold myself

430
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,260
and shoot these arrows at you.

431
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,590
Of course,

432
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,330
whoever can hold out till the end

433
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,450
will be rewarded handsomely.

434
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,670
This little devil is so full of tricks.

435
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,350
He's testing my bell language with such an elaborate setup.

436
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,110
All are dolled up, with singing and dancing.

437
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,930
Isn't he afraid of being overwhelmed by the fragrance?

438
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,660
How about it?

439
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,710
Are you ready?

440
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,110
We're ready.

441
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,580
Then, let's begin.

442
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,410
Let's go over there, quickly.

Alright, everyone,

454
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,990
go inside to collect your gold leaves.

455
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,150
Thank you, Young Lord.

456
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,280
[Chengxin Pavilion]
Thank you, Young Lord.

[Chengxin Pavilion]

458
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,750
Tell me, why did you shoot at me?

459
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,840
Couldn't you hear the bell language…

460
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,830
Your voice was so loud.

461
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Were you trying to reveal my secret?

462
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,110
Then, tell me.

463
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,940
Why didn't you follow the bell language instructions I gave you?

464
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,690
If I really let you win the grand prize,

465
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,570
wouldn't you ask for the moon?

466
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,910
But don't worry,

467
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,740
I've prepared some extra gold leaves for you.

468
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,890
Consider it a bonus reward.

469
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,670
I didn't expect it, either.

470
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,790
The Young Lord's arrow was pointing at me.

471
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,150
I thought I was surely going to lose.

472
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,710
Haven't you figured it out yet?

473
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,830
The game today

474
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,310
was designed by the Young Lord to cheer up Su Ruofei.

475
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,640
What do you mean by that?

476
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,440
You think you got the top prize,

477
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,670
but the Young Lord must have

478
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,700
given Su Ruofei even more in private.

479
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,570
This is what they call "spending a fortune

480
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,050
to make a beauty smile."

481
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,950
We're all entertainers,

482
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,350
but the Young Lord treats her differently.

483
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,820
It's clear that she's an entertainer on the surface,

484
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,220
but in reality, she's a favored concubine.

485
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,060
One, two, three, four, five, six.

486
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,580
Six gold leaves.

487
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,100
Do you think it's too little?

488
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,790
At least my efforts weren't in vain.

489
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,310
My hands are sore.

490
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,870
Young Lord.

491
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,050
Ms. Su has arrived.

492
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,900
Sister.

493
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,790
Ruoshan is here.

494
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,120
Greetings, Young Lord.

495
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,300
Sister.

496
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,870
I've missed you so much.

497
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,150
I've missed you, too.

498
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,880
Come, sit down quickly.

499
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,000
Come, sit.

500
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,850
You also want to sit?

501
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,230
Go stand over there.

502
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,310
It's been days since I've seen Fei.

503
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,110
I've been missing her very much.

504
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,310
Today, I can finally put my mind at ease.

505
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,120
Thank you, Young Lord, for taking such good care of my sister

506
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,720
and being so tolerant of her.

507
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,140
Ruoshan, you're being too polite.

508
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,270
Come, have some tea.

509
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,050
Last time you came, I happened to have urgent matters,

510
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,580
so I couldn't meet with you.

511
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,470
I wonder if you've been comfortable staying at the Symphony Workshop lately.

512
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,790
If you need anything, remember to come to me.

513
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,030
I appreciate your concern, Young Lord.

514
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,260
I'm doing well.

515
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,230
I've come unannounced today,

516
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,760
not just to visit my sister,

517
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,200
but most importantly…

518
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,340
It's because the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering is approaching.

519
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,820
I hope you can grace us with your presence.

533
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,750
is the Symphony Workshop fun?

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,870
tell me the truth.

What exactly are you doing in the Young Lord's Mansion?

539
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,910
Haven't I already told you?

540
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,370
Sister, as you know,

541
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,670
I'm just here to be a little entertainer.

542
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,110
But I've heard

543
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,030
you're the Young Lord's favored concubine.

544
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,580

545
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,070
Don't listen to such nonsense.

That little devil and I

547
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,710
have absolutely no relationship.

548
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,630
There's completely nothing between us.

550
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,470
as an entertainer in the Young Lord's Mansion,

551
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,430
you need to be careful with everything you say and do.

552
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,830
How dare you address the Young Lord like that?

Back in Cloud City,

554
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,470
your reckless behavior was one thing,

555
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,990
but this is Symphony City.

556
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,700
Your every word and action

557
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,560
not only represents our Su family

558
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,550
but also represents Cloud City.

559
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,550
Alright,

560
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,100
I understand, Sister.

561
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,670
But if that little devil bullies...

562
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,030
You're still calling him that?

563
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,160
Call him Young Lord.

564
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,100
Fine, fine, fine. Young Lord.

565
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,510
Happy now?

566
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,510
Sister,

567
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,310
whose side are you on anyway?

568
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,910
Of course, I'm always on your side,

569
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,780
but when you interact with the Young Lord,

570
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,780
you still need to mind your manners.

571
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,510
If you give others a reason to gossip,

572
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,110
it won't be good for a young lady like you.

573
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,110
Okay, okay, okay.

574
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,550
Let me walk you back.

575
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,080
Let's go.

578

Keep it safe for me.

579
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,430
Young Lord,

580
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,310
this kind of event is too exposing.

581
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,770
Are you sure you're going?

582
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,470
Since Ruoshan has cordially invited me,

583
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,710
of course I should go.

584
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,710
She saved me from danger back then.

585
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,830
I've always been thinking

586
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,790
about repaying her properly.

587
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,870
It's just that since I came back to Symphony City,

588
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,630
I've been busy training the little wildcat,

589
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,620
so I have neglected Ruoshan instead.

590
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,350
Young Lord,

591
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,710
you've asked Minister Ling

592
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,310
to take extra care of Boss Su,

593
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,160
and you've had me frequently send things over.

594
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,670
Boss Su will surely appreciate

595
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,930
your thoughtfulness.

596
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,350
But this Flowing Stream Musical Gathering,

597
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,300
according to what I've heard,

598
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,110
is for male and female musicians to find love through music.

599
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,840
If you accept this invitation,

600
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,530
doesn't it mean...

601
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,380
I really hadn't thought that much about it.

602
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,030
But since I've already promised Ruoshan,

603
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,230
it wouldn't be right not to go, would it?

604
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,330
Forget it.

605
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,060
I won't participate in the music pairing by then.

606
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,110
After training little ears for so long,

607
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,030
it's time to test the results.

608
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,090
How about this?

609
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,410
You can stay at the mansion that day.

610
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,990
I'll just take her alone.

611
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,690
Young Lord.

612
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,340
Don't worry.

613
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,150
Yes.

614
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,250
Mayor,

615
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,350
you rarely play music.

616
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,560
The harp is not easy to master.

617
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,520
Without three to five years,

618
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,080
it's hard to make progress.

619
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,590
That's right, Mayor.

620
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,670
The harp is indeed difficult to master quickly.

621
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,500
Why don't you try another instrument?

622
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,470
Go away.

623
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,150
I insist on learning the harp.

624
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,240
What are you doing with that broken trumpet?

625
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,570
What's wrong with them?

626
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,550
Can they teach me or not?

627
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,480
If they can't teach, kick them out.

628
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,140
-Yes, we can.
-Yes, we can.

629
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,910
We can teach.

630
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,390
As long as the mayor wants to learn,

631
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,920
he'll definitely succeed.

632
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,830
Yes.

633
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,470
If you focus on just one piece,

634
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,950
you could make it.

635
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,110
We just don't know

636
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
which piece you want to play.

637
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,430
Well, Shanshan didn't tell me

638
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,830
which piece to play.

639
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,750
Well...

640
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,330
Then, let's start from the beginning?

641
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,930
Alright, let's start from scratch.

642
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,920
Start from scratch.

Jin, what are you worrying about?

653
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,960
Is it because you haven't seen me for so long?

654
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,460
I just bought this house,

655
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,470
and you've already found it?

656
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,240
Of course.

You can't hide from me anyway.

I heard

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,750
you were kicked out of the Young Lord's Mansion.

I'm about to go preside over the Symphony Workshop.

699
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,240
That's why I moved out of the Young Lord's Mansion.

700
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,970
Have you moved out completely?

Doesn't that mean

is holding some kind of Flowing Stream Musical Gathering.

I'm not that interested, either.

Yes, I did.

but you need to behave.

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,120
and all the top musicians are here.

739
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,870
The grandeur of this gathering

740
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,470
is likely due to this reason.

741
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,850
This is the first time I've seen such a scene.

742
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,330
Can I look around?

743
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,500
Just for a little while.

744
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,030
I promise I'll be back soon.

745
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,620
Go ahead.

746
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,230
Remember what I just told you.

747
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,670
Okay.

748
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,140
I'll definitely be back

749
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,790
before the gathering starts.

750
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,380
I'm off.

751
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,030
Sister.

752
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,090
Why don't we go together?

753
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,170
I have something to do. You go ahead.

754
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
Remember, don't cause any trouble.

755
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,670
Young Lord, you really dote on my little sister.

756
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,640
You even brought her here to the gathering.

757
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,340
This gathering is a rare opportunity.

758
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,390
I thought I'd bring her out to broaden her horizons.

759
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,920
It's also a chance for you two sisters to meet.

760
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,030
You're so thoughtful.

761
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,990
To thank you for taking care of her these past few days,

762
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,920
I have specially adapted a piece.

763
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,830
Perhaps it will be a pleasant surprise for you.

764
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,100
Then, it seems I have something to look forward to.

765
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,760
Then, I will go prepare now.

766
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,950
Later, I hope

767
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,170
I can hear your wonderful music as well.

768
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,250
I'll take my leave now.

769
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,870
If we're destined to meet again, let it be through music.

770
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,520
Alright.

771
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,080
There are mountains and water. The scenery is really nice.

772
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,140
Ruofei.

773
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,580
Shangyu.

774
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,200
What are you doing here?

775
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,670
I thought you might come,

776
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,930
so I came to try my luck.

777
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,350
Looks like my luck is pretty good.

778
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,830
Of course I wouldn't miss

779
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,070
such a lively event.

780
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,490
Oh, by the way, Ruofei,

781
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,140
will you be participating in the music pairing later?

782
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,370
The music pairing?

783
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,000
What does that mean?

784
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,220
You don't know?

785
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,450
It's called "Floating Cups Along Winding Water."

786
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,060
It's a way to make friends through music.

787
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,710
A female musician will play first,

788
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,610
then she'll float her instrument on the flowing water.

789
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,750
If a male musician picks up the instrument

790
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,010
and continues to play,

791
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,230
it means he's interested in getting to know the female musician.

792
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,430
If the female musician is satisfied

793
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,750
with the male musician's performance,

794
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,710
she'll come out to meet him.

795
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,510
This embodies the idea of "Seeking a kindred spirit through music."

796
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,310
I see.

797
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,470
So, it's actually a social gathering.

798
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,930
You could say that.

799
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,870
Then, why did my sister invite that little devil?

800
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,510
Could it be she wants to pair up with him?

801
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,430
And why would that little devil accept the invitation?

802
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,430
That's the signal for everyone to get ready.

803
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,190
The music gathering is about to begin.

804
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,340
I should head back now.

805
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,110
Let's talk more later.

806
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,670
Ruofei.

807
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,910
You haven't answered me yet.

808
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,440
Will you participate in the music pairing?

809
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,750
If you play,

810
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,430
I can respond to your piece.

811
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,590
I'm just here to accompany the Young Lord and join the fun.

812
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,790
As for music pairing,

813
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,650
I probably won't do it.

814
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,270
Alright, no problem then.

815
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,270
You can go ahead.

816
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,350
I'll be going then.

817
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,160
See you later.

818
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,660
Could it be that Ruofei

819
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,090
doesn't know the meaning of the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering?

820
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,770
Why would the Young Lord bring her here?

821
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,620
Everyone, welcome to the Flowing Stream Musical Gathering.

822
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,730
[Flowing Stream Musical Gathering]

823
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,600
Ten years ago, when I first joined the Symphony Workshop,
[Flowing Stream Musical Gathering]

824
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:06,930
Ten years ago, when I first joined the Symphony Workshop,

825
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,280
the first event I attended was this very musical gathering.

826
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,400
The one hosting the gathering at that time

827
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,000
was none other than the current Madam Yaoshan.

828
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,860
That gathering brought together many beautiful couples.

829
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,300
My husband and I

830
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
also met at that gathering.

831
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,200
I hope that under my witness,

832
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,810
everyone can find their perfect match

833
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,740
and let music seal the affections.

834
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,230
What did Minister Ling say?

835
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,120
Minister Ling said

836
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,370
that she and her husband

837
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,370
met at this very musical gathering.

838
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,360
It seems this is truly a matchmaking event.

839
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,130
Did you really not know?

840
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,920
When you're conveying messages to me,

841
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,560
don't eat anything.

842
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,270
You're chewing and talking at the same time.

843
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,200
How am I supposed to read your lips?

844
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,910
Does no one speak to you

845
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,990
while eating?

846
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,150
Except for my parents and my uncle,

847
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,740
no one dares to speak to me while eating.

848
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,150
Oh, right.

849
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,110
If someone starts playing later,

850
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,770
use the bell language to convey the message to me.

851
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,610
Remember,

852
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,660
if you get it wrong, there will be consequences.

853
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,020
Even if I play it wrong,

854
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,370
you wouldn't even know.

855
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,350
What did you say?

856
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,170
It has begun.

857
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,330
Not bad flute playing.

858
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,230
Is Young Lord really just bringing Fei

859
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,630
to broaden her horizons?

860
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,460
Ah, the Purple Bamboo Melody.

861
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,630
Correct.

862
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,130
Good job.

863
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,930
Continue.

864
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,230
They really did end up together.

865
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,160
Don't forget our main task.

866
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,080
I remember.

867
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,780
What's wrong?

868
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,960
Are you tired?

869
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:12,940
No.

870
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,350
Give me your hand.

871
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,920
I'm fine.

872
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,800
You have this medicine with you all the time?

873
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,250
Let me do it myself.

874
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,310
Don't move around.

875
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,890
If it's an ordinary tune later,

876
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,220
you don't need to mimic it for me again.

877
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,980
When you're interested,

878
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,880
you can mimic it for me again.

879
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,560
At least you have some conscience.

880
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,660
Your skin is so delicate.

881
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,420
How can you

882
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,710
be my ears constantly?

883
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,890
It seems you still lack practice.

884
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,750
Once you develop calluses,

885
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,750
naturally, you won't hurt anymore.

886
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,330
It's my sister!

887
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,560
Young Lord.

888
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,210
This song...

889
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,410
I'm sure you haven't forgotten it.

890
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,310
Isn't this the Green Flash Chant written by

891
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,460
Madam Yaoshan?

892
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,380
Sister is actually playing this piece.

893
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,560
But if it were me,

894
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,720
I would play it, too.

895
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,710
This is my favorite piece.

896
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,820
What song did you hear

897
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,100
that made you so excited?

898
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,700
It's the Green Flash Song, played by my sister.

899
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,760
Her skills are indeed exceptional.

900
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,500
Let me play it for you.

901
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,510
Is that the feeling

902
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,190
Ruoshan wants to convey to me?

903
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,620
The jasper girl.
