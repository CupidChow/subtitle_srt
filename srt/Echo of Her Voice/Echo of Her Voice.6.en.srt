189
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,390
It's that way.

190
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,100
Ruofei?

191
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,930
Why are you here?

192
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,630
Jin!

193
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,630
Huang Ying?

194
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,060
It's not that I don't want to help you.

195
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,300
You're not helping yourself.

196
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,380
Jin Shangyu.

197
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,840
If you dare to leave...

198
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,780
No, no, no.

199
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,540
I'll kill her.

200
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,110
I'm not trying to leave.

201
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,910
Didn't you just hear?

202
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,180
They're calling to catch an assassin in the mansion.

203
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,420
I want to see if I can help.

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,030
She is that assassin.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,130
You think hiding in the Young Lord's Mansion

206
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,810
will stop me from coming?

207
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,810
Even if you hid in Yongkang Palace,

208
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,750
I'd still dare to go there.

209
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,830
Let her go first.

210
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,230
Yeah.

211
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,130
You've already seen your Jin.

212
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,430
Holding onto me is just getting in the way.

213
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,390
I've already caught her.

214
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,550
Why would I let her go to report on me?

215
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,880
Don't worry.

216
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,500
I absolutely won't go report anything.

217
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,920
Huang Ying.

218
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,830
I've told you countless times.

219
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,870
There's no possibility between us.

220
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,490
Why do you keep chasing after me?

221
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,540
If you didn't want it,

222
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,800
how could I always catch you?

223
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,430
Moreover,

224
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,310
whenever I'm in danger,

225
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,500
you even come to my rescue.

226
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,900
Isn't that because you have feelings for me?

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,820
I have to say something fair here,

228
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,980
Shangyu.

229
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,120
Mr. Jin.

230
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,150
You did save Ms. Huang

231
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,810
in Cloud City before.

232
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,140
You even pleaded for her in front of the little devil.

233
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,540
We all saw that.

234
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,060
That's right.

235
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,070
In that situation, anyone would—

236
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,390
However, Ms. Huang,

237
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,590
you're taking such a big risk

238
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,200
to find Jin in the Young Lord's Mansion.

239
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,150
What if you get caught?

240
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,620
If that bad-tempered little devil

241
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,320
kicks you out of Symphony City,

242
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,640
it won't be worth it, right?

243
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,390
She's right.

244
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,230
Why take such a big risk?

245
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,570
Hurry and leave.

246
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,590
I don't care.

247
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,190
It's your fault for hiding from me.

248
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,950
Unless you come back to Symphony Workshop with me.

249
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,150
Huang Ying, I...

250
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,790
Mr. Jin.

251
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,540
An assassin broke into the Young Lord's Mansion tonight.

252
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,550
I'm here on the Young Lord's orders to search the premises.

253
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,900
Have you noticed anything unusual here?

254
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,630
-No!
-No!

255
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,620
I heard a woman's voice.

256
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,110
It sounded like Ms. Su.

257
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,750
I heard it.

258
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,190
It's so late

259
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,630
and the Young Lord personally led men here.

260
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,040
Is there really an assassin?

261
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,660
Mr. Jin, were you alone in the room?

262
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,300
I thought I heard a woman's voice inside just now.

263
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,340
A woman's voice?

264
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,110
H-How is that possible?

265
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,280
I've always kept myself pure.

266
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,830
There'd never be a woman in my room.

267
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,390
Young Lord.

268
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,160
Please sit, Mr. Jin.

269
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,540
Sit.

270
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,690
How did you get in here?

271
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,220
If I didn't come in, I would have been discovered.

272
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,050
Now that you've come in, I'll be discovered.

273
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:11,830
What should we do then?

274
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,620
I told you.

275
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,430
There's no one here.

276
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,540
Mr. Jin, are you comfortable with your accommodations?

277
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,230
What a coincidence.

278
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,570
Greetings, Young Lord.

279
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,830
Mr. Jin, can you explain

280
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,670
why my entertainer

281
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,810
is in your room in the middle of the night

282
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,550
and under your bed, no less?

283
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,650
Well, we...

284
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,590
We were discussing musical instruments.

285
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,380
What kind of music instrument must be studied under the bed?

286
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,760
This one.

287
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,270
This was given to me by Shangyu.

288
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,260
I hid under the bed just now

289
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,300
because I wanted to study

290
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,630
its glow-in-the-dark effect.

291
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,190
Yes.

292
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,660
Ms. Su and I were studying this instrument.

293
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,840
Glow-in-the-dark effect?

294
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,630
Can an instrument made of this material

295
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,590
be played?

296
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,330
Of course it can.

297
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,120
Well...

298
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,160
It's not easy to master.

299
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,390
Enough.

300
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,230
You call that playing?

301
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,590
That's why we need to study it.

302
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,870
-Ruofei...
-I...

303
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,010
Let me.

304
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,760
Shangyu, you're amazing!

305
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,420
Indeed.

306
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,480
Mr. Jin's musical skills are impressive.

307
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,990
It's truly admirable.

308
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,700
See that?

309
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,750
Hear that?

310
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,550
This is what a master can do.

311
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,060
Since there are no assassins in this room,

312
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,060
I won't intrude any further.

313
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,230
Not at all.

314
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,860
Thank you for your concern, Young Lord.

315
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,530
What?

316
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,750
You're still not leaving?

317
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,060
Do you want to stay overnight?

318
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,850
I'll go.

319
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,990
Teach me this another day.

320
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,800
You weren't the only one under the bed, were you?

321
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,110
How did you know?

322
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,950
Was it Huang Ying?

323
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,540
Why are you glaring at me?

324
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
Why did you give her a gift?

325
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,550
Why did you play something she had played?

326
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,780
Why are you so nice to her?

327
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,990
Do you like her?

328
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,870
I... I...

329
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,710
What?

330
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,760
Mr. Jin was there,

331
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,470
so I protected his dignity.

332
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,790
Otherwise, did you think

333
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,350
I'd let you off so easily?

334
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,750
Studying instruments?

335
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,930
You really think I'm stupid?

336
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm a victim too.

337
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,930
Huang Ying forced me

338
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,810
to take her to see Shangyu.

339
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,960
Shangyu?

340
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,440
Now you're calling Mr. Jin by his first name, huh?

341
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,710
Shangyu asked me to call him that.

342
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,550
Where did you meet Huang Ying?

343
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,610
In the storage room.

344
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,780
I was protecting you,

345
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,630
that's what.

346
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,890
Protecting me?

347
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,030
So you do care about me.

348
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,180
Of course I care about you.

349
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,290
-But it’s two different—
-No buts.

350
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,630
I just need to know you care about me. That's enough.

351
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,020
Don't worry.

352
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,030
No matter where you go,

353
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,500
I'll always find you.

354
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,400
Horrible.

355
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,360
So, as you said,

356
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,510
you were dragged to Mr. Jin's room

357
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,230
and helped mediate between Jin Shangyu and Huang Ying.

358
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,900
If I remember correctly,

359
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,390
you should have been practicing at that time.

360
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,030
So, why were you in the storage room?

361
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,060
I just wanted to do something I liked

362
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,780
during my free time.

363
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,320
Su Ruofei.

364
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
I won't stop you from doing what you want.

365
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,300
But you can't forget

366
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
your primary duty as an entertainer.

367
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,460
Otherwise, I'll have to postpone

368
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,630
the restoration of your music status.

369
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,980
On what grounds?

370
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,150
If it weren't for you

371
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,030
exploiting me so inhumanely every day,

372
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,470
would I have gone to such lengths?

373
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,740
Moreover,

you were the one who first said you'd help restore my music status.

375
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,900
That's why I agreed to be your entertainer.

376
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,510
But you've been dragging it out.

377

You breached the agreement first.

378

Even if I help you restore your music status now,

379
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,620

With your current level,

381
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,650
if you go,

382
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,940
you'll only embarrass the Young Lord's Mansion.

What pains me the most

386
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,810
is that you'll destroy the future you've been dreaming of

387
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,390
with your own hands.

Achieving great things

389

Is what you did

396
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,380
worthy of the title of musician?

397
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,350
Is it worthy of entering the Symphony Workshop

398
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,780
and becoming the music minister?

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,940
What happened?

560
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,390
News from the Young Lord's Mansion.

561
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,660
There was an assassin in the mansion.

562
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,980
And he's already been captured.

563
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,720
What?

564
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,890
Huang Fu.

565
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,300
Mayor.

566
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,420
Didn't you say they were all elites you trained?

567
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,740
How could he be captured?

568
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,610
He could even be captured while just gathering information.

569
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,450
And you keep talking about helping me seize the position of royal advisor?

570
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,860
What can I accomplish relying on you?

571
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,410
Please rest assured, Mayor.

572
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,780
Even if Shadow is caught,

573
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,860
he'll never reveal any information about us.

574
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,060
Come with me to the Young Lord's Mansion first thing tomorrow morning.

575
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,400
Yes.

576
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,500
[Young Lord's Mansion]

577
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,860
Sorry to keep you waiting, Uncle.

578
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,460
Lord Huang is here, too?

579
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,540
Greetings, Young Lord.

580
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,460
Lord Huang, please rise.

581
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,100
Uncle,

582
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,860
you should've told me you were coming

583
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,900
so that I could

584
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,780
prepare a proper welcome for you.

585
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,080
Well, it was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

586
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,550
I was thinking, after returning to Symphony City,

587
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,380
I haven't had the chance to visit your mansion yet.

588
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,580
Thank you for your concern, Uncle.

589
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,580
However, your coming so early

590
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,100
with Lord Huang

591
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,940
gave me quite a fright.

592
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,740
I thought there might be some urgent matter.

593
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,300
You call this early?

594
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,780
At this hour in Cloud City,

595
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,120
I would've already finished training with the soldiers.

596
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,300
That's why I say, Mu,

597
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,380
you've grown too accustomed to a life of ease.

598
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,630
Uncle, you're mistaken.

599
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,600
Yesterday, I was far from at ease.

600
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,260
There were some minor issues at my mansion,

601
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,900
which kept me up until late into the night.

602
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,150
That's why I woke up a bit late today.

603
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,300
Oh, right,

604
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,330
Uncle, you and Lord Huang haven't eaten yet, have you?

605
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,570
Join me for the meal.

606
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,330
Come, serve the meal.

607
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,830
The taste is quite good.

608
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,740
Lord Huang,

609
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,700
make yourself at home.

610
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,820
Sit. Let's eat together.

611
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,210
Thank you, Young Lord.

612
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,220
Your face has been looking more radiant lately.

613
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,460
Mu, you really know how to enjoy life.

614
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,650
When we were in Cloud City,

615
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,570
I never saw you being so particular.

616
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,420
Well, I'm back in my own mansion now.

617
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,770
If I were at your place, Uncle,

618
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,360
I would have to be more restrained.

619
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,250
I want some more of this.

620
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,910
Mu,

621
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,540
we conquered Dongsheng

622
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,260
on horseback.

623
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,640
Your father and I

624
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,810
have both been on the battlefield and killed enemies.

625
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,800
How is it that you even

626
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,620
need someone to serve you your meal?

627
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,660
Uncle,

628
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,050
I've been given the title of Lord of Leisure.

629
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,260
If I can't enjoy it,

630
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,460
what's the point?

631
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,760
Fine wine, delicious food, and beautiful women

632
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,220
are all indispensable.

633
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,980
Mu,

634
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,650
you are still the son of His Majesty.

635
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,900
You should at least…

636
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,470
inquire about the state affairs.

637
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,220
State affairs are for you and Father to handle.

638
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,220
I only need to take care of the pleasures of life.

639
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,260
Isn't that enough?

640
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,970
Here, let me feed you.

641
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,660
Open your mouth.

642
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,740
Why are you angry, Uncle?

643
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,250
It's indeed my fault.

644
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,550
I've only been thinking about my own pleasure

645
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,890
but forgot about you, Uncle.

646
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,620
Come on, come, you all,

647
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,010
take good care of my uncle for me.

648
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,450
Yes.

649
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,540
Enough!

650
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,870
Mu,

651
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,460
didn't you say

652
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,060
there was an incident at your mansion last night?

653
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,080
How can you still be in the mood for fun now?

654
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,580
It's not a big deal.

655
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,270
We just caught an assassin, that's all.

656
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:42,850
An assassin?

657
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,500
How could there be an assassin in the Young Lord's Mansion?

658
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,640
Is this assassin dead or alive now?

659
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,620
Have you interrogated and found out anything?

660
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,420
As expected, my uncle cares about me the most.

661
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,930
Xiaoqi is interrogating him right now.

662
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,450
Oh, right!

663
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,310
Uncle, you and Lord Huang are both battle-hardened veterans.

664
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,540
You've captured countless enemies.

665
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,660
How should I interrogate prisoners?

666
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,500
Uncle, you could give me some tips on that.

667
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,130
I'd better not.

668
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,870
With my interrogation methods,

669
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,540
I'd take their lives in no time.

670
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,970
You'd better handle it yourself slowly.

671
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,050
I'm leaving.

672
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,790
Uncle, won't you have some more breakfast?

673
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,540
I can't eat anymore.

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,180

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,170
It's absolutely ridiculous.

[Mingren Hall]

679
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,900
You've seen it yourself.

680
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,940
How could a guy who's obsessed with women all day long

681
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,300
possibly become the royal advisor?

682
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,060
You insisted on prying into it.

683
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,900
And now look what's happened!

684
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,260

685
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,780
This is Symphony City, after all.

686
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,540
We need to be careful with our words.

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,300

00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,790
is to deal with the Shadow issue.
[Mingren Hall]

691
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,900
is to deal with the Shadow issue.

692
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,400
That's your problem to resolve.

693
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,560
If you can't resolve it tonight,

694
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,210
resolve yourself!

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,340
Yes, sir.

[Mingren Hall]

698
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,380
After wasting so much time,

699
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,700
if I go back without any information,

700
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,260
I'll surely be punished.

701
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,100
I'd better go investigate a bit more.

00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,090
You little devil, just you wait.

705
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,770
There's still plenty of time.

706
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,020
There's no plenty of time.

707
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,900
It's better to deal with the little devil quickly,

708
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,270
so I can go to the Symphony Workshop sooner.

709
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,620
A thousand blessings to you, Young Lord.

710
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,420
You may all rise.

711
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,100
Now, you don't even bow when you see me?

712
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,820
A thousand blessings to you, Young Lord.

713
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,300
How's your practice going?

714
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,660
As per your instructions,

715
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,810
I've memorized it all.

716
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,890
Would you like me to play it for you?

717
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,420
Sure.

718
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:08,940
Young Lord,

719
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,100
a lady named Su Ruoshan has arrived.

720
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,300
She's waiting at the gate, requesting an audience.

721
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,500
My sister is here.

722
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,460
Go tell Boss Su

723
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,210
that I have important matters to attend to today.

724
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,970
I'll visit her mansion another day.

725
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,100
Yes, sir.

726
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,780
Come on.

727
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,370
If you don't have time, I do.

728
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,370
I'm going to see my sister.

729
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,790
All of you may leave now.

730
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,100
-Yes.
-Yes.

731
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,020
What are you doing?

732
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,940
Don't move.

733
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,700
There's someone outside.

734
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,190
Who is it?

735
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,780
Some bad guy, of course.

736
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,550
You want me to act with you?

737
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,930
Why should I cooperate with you?

738
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,700
If you don't cooperate,

739
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,500
then I'll have to force myself on you.

740
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,950
Young Lord,

741
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,820
you're so annoying!

742
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,220
I'm not playing with you anymore.

743
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,940
My dear, whether it's the roc in the sky

744
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,640
or the giant salamander in the water,

745
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,250
as long as it's what you want,

746
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,750
I'll give it to you.

747
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,850
Really?

748
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,810
Will Young Lord give me anything I want?

749
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,810
Of course.

750
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,220
I want...

751
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,820
my letter of commitment.

752
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,100
Granted.

753
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,740
Young Lord,

754
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
you must keep your word.

755
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,900
I have promised you.

756
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,620
I will certainly help you achieve it.

757
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,770
I have one more request.

758
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,490
I want you to help me restore my music status.

759
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,060
My dear wants quite a lot.

760
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,670
If that's what you want,

761
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,640
then help me perform the act well.

762
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,700
You're so naughty.

763
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,610
Let me give you a back massage, then.

764
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,930
The pressure is just right.

765
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,430
My dear,

766
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,290
don't push your luck.

767
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,220
Is he gone?

768
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,420
Yes, Young Lord.

769
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,740
These acts of yours

770
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,630
were performed brilliantly.

771
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,140
Now that we've finished our performance,

772
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,410
let's see how they'll play their parts.

773
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,890
[Young Lord's Mansion]

774
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,660
Ms. Su,
[Young Lord's Mansion]

775
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,190
[Young Lord's Mansion]

776
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
Young Lord is unavailable today.

777
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,210
Please return for now.

778
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,170
Young Lord said

779
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,140
he'd visit Symphony Workshop another day.

780
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,740
Excuse me, Miss,

781
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,320
is there an entertainer

782
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,860
named Su Ruofei at your mansion?

783
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,740
Yes, there is.

784
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,350
Then, please let me see her.

785
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,470
I'm her sister.

786
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,510
She's with Young Lord…

787
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,890
She's with Young Lord…

788
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,020
Anyway, both she and Young Lord are unavailable.

789
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,180
Please return for now.

790
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,190
Where's my letter of commitment?

791
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,020
Your words are like gold.

792
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,050
You cannot go back on your word.

793
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,100
Xiaoqi,

794
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,690
go to the study later and give her the letter of commitment.

795
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,340
Letters.

796
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,100
Thank you, Young Lord.

797
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,880
Should I go practice my wrist bells now?

798
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,580
Go ahead.
