1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:07,737
Is she kidding me?

2
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:11,717
What's she trying to do?

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,437
Huh?

4
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:17,477
What's the thing in there?

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:28,940
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Waiting on a Miracle Team 🙏 @ Viki.com 

6
00:00:34,347 --> 00:00:35,827
What the heck is that?

7
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:40,967
All kinds of stuff, such as documents, music, and videos... can be stored here.

8
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:44,357
Like a floppy disk or a hard drive?

9
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:45,907
Yes.

10
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:47,547
You're smart.

11
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,927
Let's go see what's inside.

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,600
   
   

13
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,080
   

14
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,870
   

15
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,340
   

16
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,270
   

17
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,780
   

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,200
   

19
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,220
   

20
00:01:57,157 --> 00:02:00,557
Wow! If this gets exposed,

21
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:03,877
the entire country will get flipped upside down.

22
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:06,807
It does look crazy, even to me.

23
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:10,857
Of course, it is.

24
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:15,677
It is evidence of a conglomerate's lobbying for powerful figures in Korea.

25
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:19,537
Why did she give you such an important thing?

26
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,057
That's my question.

27
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:26,287
 Why did you give it to Yook Dong Joo? 

28
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:29,977
That's your barrier, CEO.

29
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:33,607
Yook Dong Joo looked like he'd need it more.

30
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:40,607
I also owe a debt to that lad's father.

31
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:43,687
If he discloses it right away, you'll get hurt.

32
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:47,567
Yook Dong Joo is clever.

33
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:52,037
Seeing how he didn't cower in front of Chairman Lee Tae Man, he also has some guts.

34
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:56,447
He'll choose the proper time.

35
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,857
Isn't it...

36
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,147
about time you tell me now?

37
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:08,757
Where does he live right now?

38
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,297
I apologize.

39
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:17,377
Does he not trust me?

40
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:20,127
He's trying to protect you.

41
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:33,597
   

42
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:40,757
Please stay put. You're all over the place.

43
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:48,047
Why on Earth did she give this to me?

44
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,667
If I open it up, she wouldn't be safe, either.

45
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,087
How come?

46
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,277
Because the location is Fortuna.

47
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,357
Fortuna?

48
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,567
The Goddess of fate.

49
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,097
What are you saying?

50
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,217
I'm confused about whose side the Goddess of Fate is on.

51
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:10,597
She's on our side since she gave you an important item.

52
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:13,797
The world isn't that simple.

53
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:16,507
She must have another intention.

54
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:22,427
Gosh, my brains are about to be fried.

55
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,367
Why are you drinking when your brains are about to be fried?

56
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:43,077
Beer isn't alcohol. It's a sedative.

57
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:49,427
- What are you doing? 
 - Calming myself down.

58
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:51,557
A minor can't drink alcohol!

59
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,297
You said beer isn't alcohol.

60
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,827
I'll give you something even better.

61
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:01,397
Here.

62
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:03,097
- Drink this. 
 - It's water.

63
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:07,147
It's not just water. It's sparkling water. It tastes like beer.

64
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,827
What's this supposed to taste like?

65
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:17,237
The modern-day teenagers' favorite taste.

66
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,007
Just expose it!

67
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,597
Without any conditions?

68
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:26,657
Hand it over to the press or a journalist.

69
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,917
They're figures who basically run this country.

70
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:35,527
Even if there's blatant evidence, they can cover it up if they want to.

71
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,497
How can they cover it up when the file's there?

72
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:41,417
They'll dilute the issue among a bunch of absurd excuses.

73
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:46,627
The nature of the issue will become blurry and they might even be the ones to sue me for defamation.

74
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,907
But there's the law and people who'd have seen the file.

75
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:51,397
The reality is they're found innocent due to

76
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:54,707
lack of evidence, even if video and audio evidence are provided.

77
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,047
Does that make sense?

78
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:57,917
Does it make sense you came from the past?

79
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,287
Well, that's a different matter.

80
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,427
I'm sure it'll cause a commotion for a while when exposed,

81
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:07,067
but once they start manipulating the media to their favor...

82
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,477
things will just end in vain meaninglessly after a bunch of political exchanges.

83
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,237
And people will easily forget.

84
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,477
Why are you so negative without even trying it first?

85
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:18,877
I'm not being negative. It's called being critical.

86
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,937
And the world is changed by critical people.

87
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,050
Are we trying to change the world here?

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,287
We just need to expose it.

89
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,767
Timing is what's important.

90
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,877
- The timing? 
 - What matters the most to us right now...

91
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:35,197
is bringing to light the truth from 27 years ago by finding the evidence.

92
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,647
- Do you agree? 
 - I do, and?

93
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,377
But we have no proof to bring the truth to light.

94
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:44,747
And we've already been exposed to them.

95
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,437
What's your point?

96
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:52,107
This is a type of insurance policy.

97
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:53,937
An insurance policy?

98
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,717
Something like a life jacket you use to save yourself

99
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,727
when you're about to lose your life from getting swept up by a sudden wave.

100
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:04,467
We hold onto it until we find the evidence... and make it explode when the time seems right.

101
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:12,337
Let's first make a copy.

102
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:19,407
Is the chairman of Taekang Group in the file related to the incident from 27 years ago?

103
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,707
Is he the culprit?

104
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:28,447
Is he the chaebol heir called T from the novel?

105
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:42,390
You need to promise this one thing.

106
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,597
What is it?

107
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:51,077
From now on, you'll never act on your own... putting yourself in danger, no matter what.

108
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:54,667
- You promise me, too. 
 - What promise?

109
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,347
We're going to share all the information from now on.

110
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:00,557
Secrets are never allowed to exist.

111
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,427
You should never say never.

112
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:06,457
Then I can't promise you, either.

113
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:11,717
All right.

114
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,417
Deal. I promise you.

115
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,437
Deal. Ari-ari.

116
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,907
What does that mean?

117
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,207
Purely a Korean phrase for fighting.

118
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,537
So what's your plan from now on?

119
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,357
I didn't know I had a plan until now.

120
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,237
Where are you going?

121
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,067
I think I've got a stomach virus.

122
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,617
My stomach hurts a lot, and I've got a fever, too.

123
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:36,907
Gosh, that must hurt.

124
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,827
I think I should go to the ER at the very least.

125
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,857
If it's too severe, go rest at home after visiting the hospital.

126
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:43,707
How can I do that during an emergency?

127
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:46,087
Just get treated first and let me know.

128
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,777
Okay, I'll do that.

129
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,030
   

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,740
   

131
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,220
     

132
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:12,057
I just can't understand, no matter what.

133
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:17,157
According to NFS's results,

134
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:21,567
- it means somebody messed with Jeon Doo Hyeon's corpse after he died. 
 - Yes.

135
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,987
The one who did that is the one who killed Shin Kyeong Cheol.

136
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,697
Probably.

137
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,637
Why do you think he did?

138
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:37,247
Why did he bother to damage the crime scene?

139
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:40,387
He actually covered up Byeon Jong Il's crime, didn't he?

140
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:44,627
I think Byeon Jong Il probably camouflaged Jeon Doo Hyeon's death as suicide.

141
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,497
Things like his will could've been there, too.

142
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:53,147
He changed the scene to stop it from getting closed up as suicide?

143
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:56,337
He probably wanted to warn us.

144
00:09:56,337 --> 00:10:00,880
Since Byeon Jong Il also got surprised to learn the scene was altered.

145
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:05,607
- It's a sort of a starting flare of his revenge? 
 - Most likely.

146
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:09,317
But how did he know the location of the scene? It's not like he's a god.

147
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:13,027
We didn't see anyone else in the CCTV footage.

148
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:20,767
The person who knows the scene's location is...

149
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:23,990
Noh Myeong Nam.

150
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,217
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

151
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:35,667
You're the student named Lee Ha Neul, who was at Sopyeong Lake...

152
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,457
27 years ago. Right?

153
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,967
Noh Myeong Nam's phone is off.

154
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:49,037
Are you saying Noh Myeong Nam damaged the scene?

155
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:53,307
The CCTV footage matches his testimony perfectly, doesn't it?

156
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:57,457
That's what happened at Byeon Jong Il's home. We can't check what happened after.

157
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:02,387
And we only... believed everything Noh Myeong Nam testified.

158
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:05,147
A detective showed me a montage.

159
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,707
They made it based on your picture from when you were a student.

160
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:12,257
But it didn't look much like you.

161
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:14,697
However...

162
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:17,657
I was able to recognize the eyes.

163
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:20,947
That's when I realized...

164
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:25,557
I've done a terrible thing to you.

165
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,637
I shouldn't have gone to you that night.

166
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:35,967
   

167
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:48,797
 He was already dead. I didn't kill him. 

168
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,897
 Byeon Jong Il's the one who killed him. 

169
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:53,307
 I saw him coming out of his home. 

170
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:57,157
 I tried to get him down from the tree somehow, but he was already dead. 

171
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,807
 D-Did you touch the corpse? 

172
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,607
 Y-Yes... 

173
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,787
 And what else did you do? 

174
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:15,197
 I ran away out of fear. I ran away because I was afraid of being framed again. 

175
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:18,037
 I'd rather die than go back to prison! 

176
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:22,757
 You didn't record anything that might serve as proof? 

177
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:27,397
 - Huh? 
 - You didn't take pictures or videos on your phone? 

178
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:30,547
 I couldn't even think of that. 

179
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,337
 What a foolish human. 

180
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,147
 Who can I avenge with this stupid head? 

181
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:39,387
 I spent 25 years in prison. 

182
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:43,427
 Everything was strange to me, including my phone and all— 

183
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,787
 What are you looking for? 

184
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,457
 I don't have it. 

185
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,687
 My phone's not here. 

186
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,647
 I used it as a flashlight at the mountain. 

187
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,697
 You didn't leave it in your car? 

188
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:58,967
 I must've dropped it at the mountain. 

189
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,887
   

190
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:08,407
 I erased all traces of you. 

191
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,687
 However, they'll be able to track your movement 

192
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:15,067
 from Byeon Jong Il's home to Mt. Ogeo using your phone. 

193
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,337
 What should I do? 

194
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:20,937
 Should I report this to the police and tell them Byeon Jong Il killed him? 

195
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:24,257
 There's no other proof besides your testimony. 

196
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,707
 He'll get out of this easily. 

197
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,677
 There's a CCTV in front of his house. 

198
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:35,237
 Didn't you say Byeon Jong Il didn't even come outside? 

199
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:37,807
 And I'm sure he took care of that already. 

200
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:45,577
 If the detectives come to you, just tell them everything you saw. 

201
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:50,987
 However, you've got to say you only followed to the entrance of Mt. Ogeo and came back. 

202
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,317
 Keep it in mind. 

203
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:02,017
 When the detectives come to you, you have to tell them what I told you to say. 

204
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,837
That day was the beginning. Right?

205
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,797
I was the one to sever the string which has been keeping you together...

206
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:15,117
for 25 years that night.

207
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,057
I've done a terrible thing to you.

208
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:24,157
 I heard sounds. 

209
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:28,867
 I heard the sounds of my inner wrath I've been suppressing 

210
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:32,167
 with all my might, becoming a monster and bursting out. 

211
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:37,507
 I heard the sounds of the string of self-deception I maintained 

212
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:41,027
 for my desire to live as a human being, getting cut so easily. 

213
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:45,727
 The demon's chariot wheel didn't stop. 

214
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:49,027
 It's become more evil. 

215
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:51,937
 God doesn't judge the demon. 

216
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:54,277
 I'll be the one to end this. 

217
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:57,527
 My inner darkness... 

218
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,937
 swept up all the light. 

219
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,617
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,537
Why are you apologizing?

221
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:16,147
I couldn't do anything, even though I knew...

222
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,467
you were wrongfully accused.

223
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:23,207
The evidence was gone...

224
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,027
and I ran away because...

225
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,067
I was terrified out of my wits.

226
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:35,737
I hid behind someone else's name... like the coward I was.

227
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,867
- I'm really sorry. 
 - That's not true.

228
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,677
You didn't do anything wrong.

229
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:47,477
I was only served what I deserved.

230
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:53,637
I have been only angry about what happened to me.

231
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:58,107
Every night was pain because I was so angry and distraught.

232
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,677
"Why is god so cruel to me...

233
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:04,097
who has not done anything wrong?'

234
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,237
I resented god and cursed him.

235
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:11,347
When I found out about the student from 27 years ago...

236
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:14,997
who fought alone to save a homeless person...

237
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:17,777
was you, I realized...

238
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,917
that I'm guilty.

239
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:27,587
I looked the other way, even when a person was dying.

240
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,887
Because I didn't want any trouble.

241
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:35,337
I pretended not to have seen it for such a stupid reason.

242
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:39,817
I turned my eyes, although I saw you getting beat up.

243
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,967
I turned away from a person's death and...

244
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:47,687
I pushed you into too cruel of a life...

245
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,817
when you were only 19 years old.

246
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:56,647
I was only punished for the crime I committed.

247
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,127
It's still not too late.

248
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,427
Forget everything and live your life.

249
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,347
Reading the books you like...

250
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,647
working the farms with me...

251
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,917
and sharing a glass of rice wine...

252
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:24,197
let's live like that.

253
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:28,367
Everything else is meaningless.

254
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,267
You're a good man.

255
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,947
I know it for a fact.

256
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:44,427
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,070
   

258
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,827
There's no use reading them. They've all been fabricated.

259
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:38,087
You said the guy we met last time was wrongfully accused. Right?

260
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:43,327
Yes. We need to find the proof quickly for Noh Myeong Nam's sake as well.

261
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:48,077
If that's true, that girl's father is the police officer who fabricated this case, huh?

262
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:49,547
Huh?

263
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:55,427
The girl said it back then. Her father framed the guy before.

264
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,817
You're totally right.

265
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,997
Why did I realize such an important thing only now?

266
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,887
Are you stupid?

267
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,517
My circuits were just overloaded with too many things shortly.

268
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:11,527
Will you be able to find the proof with those circuits?

269
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:16,617
They work fine as long as you don't cause any problems. All right. M-Move aside.

270
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,810
   

271
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:24,847
   

272
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,047
 Goodness. 

273
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,937
 What a good boy. 

274
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,877
Yes, this is him.

275
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:47,517
He became an assemblyman?

276
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:51,757
He probably got a strong sponsor for covering up the crime.

277
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,857
He's also probably the one who visited the bookstore the day you came here.

278
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,567
That means my father was—

279
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,197
It's Detective Park.

280
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,657
Don't forget what you promised me.

281
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:22,387
Okay.

282
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,817
- You're here? 
 - Yes.

283
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,657
You've been doing well, right?

284
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:38,387
Don't you think you're intruding on our privacy... by visiting without proper notice like this?

285
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,417
I just had something to confirm.

286
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,937
- What is it? 
 - Could I use your bathroom before that?

287
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:45,947
I guess you're in a hurry.

288
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,327
I just want to wash my hands.

289
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,617
Go ahead.

290
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,917
But where's the bathroom?

291
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,577
Over there.

292
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,497
You can't act on your own.

293
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,787
I said I got it.

294
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,847
Is it still off?

295
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:22,357
Yes.

296
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,397
That's weird.

297
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,047
The Grandeur is a stolen car.

298
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:33,947
The license plate was also reported stolen.

299
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:37,097
Just what I thought. Gosh.

300
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:40,217
I knew things were going way too smoothly.

301
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:44,147
Ask the Violent Crimes Division Team 2 for their cooperation and screenshot the CCTV video and share it.

302
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:46,777
Also, start interrogating the informants.

303
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:49,427
- Okay. 
 - You know how the hitman industry runs.

304
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,797
It's less than a six-degree of separation there.

305
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,637
I'm going to visit Noh Myeong Nam's house.

306
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:58,407
- Right now? 
 - Yeah.

307
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:01,457
- Then, I'll continue to call Noh Myeong Nam. 
 - Okay.

308
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:04,207
Huh? Where's the USB?

309
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,577
Detective Kim looked at it earlier, but it's not on his computer.

310
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,047
It's probably on his desk. Take a good look.

311
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:14,967
Where did this punk leave it?

312
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,127
I think he locked it in his drawer.

313
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,067
Where did Detective Kim go?

314
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,467
He went to the ER because his stomach virus got bad.

315
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,577
Ask Detective Kim about it.

316
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,847
What did he eat this time to get a stomach virus?

317
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:29,987
   

318
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,357
Hey, it's me. Where's the USB?

319
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,157
The USB?

320
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,157
I think I left it plugged into my computer.

321
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:46,747
If it's not there... it should be somewhere on the desk.

322
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:48,217
 It's not here, man. 

323
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:50,377
You sure you didn't put it in your drawer and locked it? Think carefully.

324
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:53,047
Did he take it with him?

325
00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:55,077
Where are you?

326
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,207
Come right back after you're done getting treated.

327
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,697
He said he left it on the computer.

328
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:04,137
He didn't leave it in the drawer?

329
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,747
He's not sure, he said.

330
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:09,227
What the hell is he thinking? Tell him to come back right now and find it!

331
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:10,837
He must've been too sick to be in the right mind.

332
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:12,877
We didn't make a copy?

333
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:15,787
We gave it to Detective Kim right after we saw it.

334
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:17,537
There's no copy?

335
00:25:17,537 --> 00:25:19,867
Don't worry. I'm sure it's inside the drawer.

336
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:22,327
It's not like the USB can walk.

337
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,927
He looks just like you. Right?

338
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,647
They do look a lot alike.

339
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,007
Are they d-doppelgangers?

340
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,177
They don't look alike. They're the same.

341
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:44,127
People can look alike or even the same. But that's not a crime.

342
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:47,207
You said the name you remembered is Lee Kang San. Right?

343
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:48,747
Yes.

344
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,637
This student's name is Lee Kang San.

345
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:55,197
And Lee Ha Neul is Lee Kang San's older brother.

346
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,547
Both people went missing 27 years ago.

347
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,967
Twenty-seven years ago? You weren't even born.

348
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,907
Also, Lee Ha Neul's student ID was found with the skeletal remains you found.

349
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,757
Who are you, really?

350
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,987
What are you doing right now? Huh?

351
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,707
What are you doing to a kid who still has an incomplete memory?

352
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,387
I'm trying to help him recover those lost memories.

353
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:28,867
You said you want to find your family.

354
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,407
How could you be so cruel?

355
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:34,017
- I'm cruel? 
 - Get out.

356
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:35,377
Talk to me if you've got something to say.

357
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,407
That's not my brother!

358
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,687
My brotheris alive.

359
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,597
He absolutely didn't die.

360
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,937
What are you saying right now?

361
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,317
I'm sorry I couldn't keep our promise.

362
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,237
What did you say just now?

363
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:58,867
I said my brother didn't die.

364
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,507
The skeletal remains don't belong to my brother.

365
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:03,477
Wait, hold on.

366
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:07,547
So you're saying Lee Ha Neul is your brother right now?

367
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:09,747
I'm Lee Kang San.

368
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,750
You're Lee Kang San?

369
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,170
Yes. Lee Ha Neul is my brother.

370
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,867
What are you saying right now?

371
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:22,327
I came from 27 years in the past.

372
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,057
- What? 
 - I'm saying I came from 1995.

373
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:29,567
You came from the past?

374
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,607
Yes.

375
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,807
You said you have supernatural powers. Now you're saying you're from the past?

376
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,937
Yes.

377
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,787
It's the truth.

378
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:56,687
Everything Kang San said... is all true.

379
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,017
Have you both... gone mad or something?

380
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:03,977
We're both fine.

381
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,447
On the day of the car accident... Kang San came to the future by traveling through space time.

382
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:23,847
   

383
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,717
Yes, Senior.

384
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,180
A copy?

385
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,850
Yes.

386
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,997
I think we lost the USB that has the CCTV footage.

387
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:36,557
 How did you lose it? 

388
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:39,277
I'll tell you the specifics later.

389
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:40,500
Did you make a copy?

390
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,020
Yes, I made a backup.

391
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,697
How troublesome.

392
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:48,117
What do you mean?

393
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:50,707
Okay, then. We'll have to look for it.

394
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,610
Should I call you back in five minutes?

395
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,740
No need. How did things go on your end?

396
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,717
I secured his DNA.

397
00:28:57,717 --> 00:29:02,307
Stop by Noh Myeong Nam's home and his laundromat. He's been out of reach for a while now.

398
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,387
I just have a bad feeling about this.

399
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:07,127
Yes. Okay.

400
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,187
She didn't make a copy?

401
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,657
No.

402
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:17,927
My goodness, this is bad.

403
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,597
We're back to square one if we lose this.

404
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:23,817
I'm sure it's in the drawer.

405
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:26,687
Tell Detective Kim to come in right now and find it!

406
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:29,607
He said he'll come once the treatment is done.

407
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,827
Why isn't she coming?

408
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,927
Did she just leave?

409
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,577
No way.

410
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:57,507
Right?

411
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:01,307
There's no way she'd just leave when we unleashed a nuclear truth.

412
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,807
Gosh, why isn't she coming?

413
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,287
Where's Detective Park?

414
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:25,577
She left.

415
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:27,987
She just left?

416
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:29,817
Yes.

417
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:32,877
Excavating the truth isn't as easy as I thought.

418
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:34,497
It's a thorny road.

419
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:36,867
Let's find my brother first.

420
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:40,607
I'm sure Brother has the videotape.

421
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,177
Would he have stayed put if he really had it?

422
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:47,767
Does the videotape even exist? What if they got rid of it already?

423
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:49,207
What's wrong with you?

424
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:50,987
What do you mean?

425
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,297
The skeletal remains aren't your brother's.

426
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:55,450
I know it, too.

427
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,650
But why are you so anxious all of a sudden?

428
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,087
You said we'll uncover the truth with the evidence.

429
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:01,637
We need to do something.

430
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:04,407
That's what will make my brother appear.

431
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,937
Let's go.

432
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:08,297
W-Where?

433
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:11,187
The man with a cross tattoo should be at the church.

434
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:13,077
We can't just recklessly barge in there.

435
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:14,517
We need to go and look for it, though.

436
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:16,837
If anyone's going, I'll be the one to go.

437
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:19,927
No one knows what will happen once the cult leader sees you.

438
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:23,357
He'll probably think I look familiar. Detective Park didn't believe us, either.

439
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,777
Oh, right. The watch.

440
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,597
The watch?

441
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,587
This is my father's watch.

442
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:38,027
He had it on even the day you came, jumping through space and time.

443
00:31:38,027 --> 00:31:41,367
You might be able to see something important from this.

444
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:51,237
I'll send you a picture, so please confirm if it's the detective

445
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,607
who took the CCTV footage two years ago.

446
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,517
   

447
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:31,107
Did you confirm?

448
00:32:32,897 --> 00:32:34,847
Are you sure?

449
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,267
Yes.

450
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:39,507
That detective...

451
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:43,597
- isn't the one. 
 - Thank you.

452
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:47,187
I'll come to see you tomorrow to have other pictures confirmed, too.

453
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,697
Yes.

454
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:50,217
Okay, then.

455
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,227
Happy now?

456
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:22,437
Good job.

457
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,187
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,787
I can't do this anymore.

459
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:37,557
- What? 
 - I can't anymore.

460
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,817
And I won't.

461
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:44,797
You say you can't do this anymore when I saved you from bankruptcy?

462
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:48,577
- I already did enough to repay you. 
 - You need to be punished, then.

463
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:55,307
On top of illegal gambling, if you sell info about police to the gambling house...

464
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:57,597
how many years do you usually get?

465
00:33:57,597 --> 00:34:00,267
Will you get a harder sentence since you're a detective?

466
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,787
No, wait. More importantly...

467
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:07,457
your old mother will have her world fall apart since you're her only hope.

468
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:11,337
You better behave properly.

469
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:15,357
If you don't repay kindness with thanks, you're not a human. You'd be an animal.

470
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:49,707
 How dare you step out of line and lecture your senior. 

471
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:51,987
 Hyungnim, it was my mistake. 

472
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,437
 It was me. I-I made a mistake. 

473
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:58,017
What the heck is this?

474
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,867
- You don't see it? 
 - I don't.

475
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:10,497
- You see nothing? 
 - Nothing.

476
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:13,847
G-Give it one more try.

477
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:16,207
We already tried many times.

478
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:18,967
What kind of power doesn't work when you need it to?

479
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:22,057
It's not like I can control it as I want.

480
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:25,677
I'm sure there's a rule to how it works.

481
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,837
   

482
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:32,237
 Hey, it's me. 

483
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:37,487
You'd be dead surprised to know who stole your dad's hit-and-run accident report and covered it up.

484
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,777
 It was Byeon Jong Il. 

485
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:41,317
How did you know?

486
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:44,927
Because my circuits are back to normal.

487
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:49,537
If he got rid of the case completely, he was trying to cover up the hit-and-run.

488
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:51,167
 It wasn't an accident. 

489
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,717
What?

490
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,417
He was murdered.

491
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,287
Are you saying it was made to look like a hit-and-run?

492
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:01,537
Could it have to do with Byeon Jong Il?

493
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:06,427
I'm sure he's the culprit, though I can't prove it.

494
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:08,087
Dong Joo...

495
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:14,337
I'm tailing Byeon Jong Il secretly right now.

496
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:15,247
You did what?

497
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:19,947
There's no way to prove he covered up the hit-and-run and finding a witness is impossible at this point,

498
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:22,897
so I followed him after waiting in front of his office.

499
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,357
Do you know how dangerous that is?

500
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:26,707
Hey, I'm the police.

501
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:28,947
That guy is one heinous bastard!

502
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:31,247
Do you know who the heinous bastard met up with?

503
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:32,487
Who did he meet?

504
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:36,037
A detective from Detective Park's team.

505
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:36,847
What?

506
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:40,917
I saw him at Violent Crimes Team 3 when I went to testify.

507
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,787
I'm sure he's the detective from then.

508
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:45,847
- Where are you right now? 
 - Han River.

509
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,877
Come here. Let's meet up and talk.

510
00:36:47,877 --> 00:36:49,847
I can't right now because I'm on the night shift.

511
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:52,437
I'll call you right after I get off work in the morning.

512
00:36:54,817 --> 00:36:57,127
What did you mean?

513
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:01,137
Who did you say was murdered?

514
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,977
My father.

515
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:13,277
He's not home. I'm going to check his laundromat.

516
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:14,107
Sorry?

517
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,817
I just talked to him. Come to the laundromat since he's there.

518
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,677
There's something not right about Noh Myeong Nam's testimony.

519
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:41,227
I'm sorry, but we're not open right now.

520
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:48,897
It looks like my father had the videotape.

521
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,647
- Ahjussi did? 
 - Yes.

522
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:59,527
My father told you to go out through the back door with the bag when the detective came. Right?

523
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:02,077
Yes.

524
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:05,407
Since he made sure to give you the bag safely,

525
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:10,137
I thought the videotape could've been in there.

526
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:12,877
But the videotape wasn't in the bag.

527
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:16,147
Where could it be, then?

528
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:20,737
Inferring based on your memory...

529
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:26,347
 What are you doing? Open the door! 

530
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:33,087
I'm sure Father hid the videotape somewhere in the bookstore.

531
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:37,807
In the short moment he had after letting you escape...

532
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:41,317
and before the moment Father encountered the detective.

533
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:47,307
That's the only time Father had... to hide the videotape.

534
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:51,547
He could've hidden it somewhere else after meeting the detective. Right?

535
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:55,367
He didn't have time to hide it elsewhere.

536
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,677
How come?

537
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:59,157
Because he passed away that day.

538
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,237
From a fake hit-and-run.

539
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:05,387
Really?

540
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,787
Yes.

541
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,647
But it wasn't among Father's keepsakes.

542
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:16,717
I just have no idea where he hid it.

543
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,987
I didn't know.

544
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:25,417
I'm sorry.

545
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:27,477
Why are you apologizing?

546
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:30,567
You and your brother are both victims.

547
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,497
- But still— 
 - But still, don't say "but still."

548
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:36,777
Don't say it.

549
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:41,147
The ones who should be atoning are having the time of their lives

550
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,637
without an ounce of guilt or regret.

551
00:39:43,637 --> 00:39:47,777
Why are the innocent always the ones to apologize and regret?

552
00:39:47,777 --> 00:39:49,987
Don't do those things.

553
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:55,357
But I'm still sorry for what happened.

554
00:39:55,357 --> 00:39:58,347
If you're sorry, think about it carefully.

555
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,097
About what?

556
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,267
I have no memory of what the bookstore

557
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:06,427
looked like or what was there because I was too young.

558
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:08,597
But you should be able to remember. Right?

559
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:11,757
Although it's a 27-years-old past for me,

560
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:14,317
it should be a present memory for you.

561
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:17,647
There wasn't anything special.

562
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,857
Give it some more thought.

563
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:25,717
Wasn't there any place to hide the videotape inside the bookstore?

564
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,057
I'm not sure who's suffering from memory loss.

565
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:34,417
Gosh, never mind.

566
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:37,127
There were bookshelves...

567
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:41,027
- and books. 
 - Those are givens.

568
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:44,177
There was a table-looking thing...

569
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:02,027
 There was a woodworking room in the bookstore. 

570
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,907
 That's right. 

571
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:07,987
 Father used to make me this and that from wood. 

572
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:11,707
I don't know where it all went.

573
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:12,847
Did you throw them out?

574
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:16,067
I'm not sure what my mom did with them when we moved.

575
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:18,707
The rocking horse and car were exquisite.

576
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,447
What a waste.

577
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,247
That's what I'm saying.

578
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:27,217
It's just a memory from a photo now.

579
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:32,347
There's a photo of me sitting in the wooden car.

580
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:34,687
Was it that big?

581
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:36,817
Big enough to get in.

582
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:46,217
Was there somewhere he could hide it in the car?

583
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:49,097
I'm not sure.

584
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:51,547
Wooden car...

585
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:54,930
We can check. You said you have a photo.

586
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,677
 Car? 

587
00:41:58,677 --> 00:42:02,297
You know the wooden car Father made? Where is that now?

588
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:03,467
Did you throw it out?

589
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:06,177
How could I when your dad made it?

590
00:42:06,177 --> 00:42:09,067
And your dad was skilled with his hands.

591
00:42:09,067 --> 00:42:11,127
Everyone wanted it.

592
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:13,527
So where is it now?

593
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:17,087
We held onto it until you were in kindergarten since you enjoyed it.

594
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:20,057
Did I give it to someone when we moved?

595
00:42:20,057 --> 00:42:21,867
Think carefully.

596
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:25,307
This is out of the blue. Why are you suddenly looking for that?

597
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:28,417
Something important might be inside it.

598
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:32,317
Are you still looking for that tape or something?

599
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:37,037
Was there space inside the car to hide a videotape?

600
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:38,517
I don't think so.

601
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:42,057
I would've seen the tape if there was.

602
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:44,667
That's true.

603
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:48,147
Anyway, give me a call if you remember who you gave the car to.

604
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:50,537
And you know the picture on the table?

605
00:42:50,537 --> 00:42:54,647
The picture of me sitting in the car. Take a photo of that and send it to me.

606
00:42:56,787 --> 00:42:58,567
All right.

607
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:05,297
Gosh, so frustrating.

608
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:08,727
Who did I give it to again?

609
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:10,727
Gosh.

610
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:18,257
I can't tell just from the photo.

611
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:21,487
Little Dong Joo was cute.

612
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:25,307
You're all grown up now, kiddo.

613
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:27,227
What did you do while I grew up?

614
00:43:27,227 --> 00:43:29,787
I was already a grownup.

615
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:31,817
I hope we find the car.

616
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,017
Little Dong Joo really liked the car.

617
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:42,047
Where could he have gone leaving the door unlocked?

618
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:48,847
   

619
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,807
Let's wait a bit.

620
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,037
Is Noh Myeong Nam's car here?

621
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:04,127
I think he parks it in the alley due to limited parking space.

622
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:06,017
- I'll take a look. 
 - Okay.

623
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,787
Senior! Senior!

624
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,857
Pull!

625
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:55,857
Noh Myeong Nam.

626
00:44:55,857 --> 00:44:58,207
Noh Myeong Nam!

627
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,880
   

628
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:33,707
There's no CCTV in front of the cleaners.

629
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:36,057
- What about the road? 
 - There's a traffic CCTV,

630
00:45:36,057 --> 00:45:39,187
but it's too far from the cleaners to capture the area.

631
00:45:40,217 --> 00:45:42,927
Search every corner for nearby vehicle dashcams.

632
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:44,337
All right.

633
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:18,347
 Please contact me. It's urgent. 

634
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:24,867
I think they tried to cover it up as a suicide.

635
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:07,967
Yeah.

636
00:47:08,507 --> 00:47:10,097
Hello?

637
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:11,437
Hello—

638
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,897
- Huh? 
  - Hey, Woo Jeng! 

639
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:23,337
Sorry, I didn't realize I ran out of battery.

640
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:25,747
It's fine as long as you're okay.

641
00:47:25,747 --> 00:47:28,817
Yeah, come out for a moment.

642
00:47:28,817 --> 00:47:31,627
I came to the address you sent me,

643
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:33,917
but I'm not sure if this is the right place.

644
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,917
Okay, hold on. I'll be right out.

645
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,697
- Who is that? 
 - Woo Jeong!

646
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:41,667
Who's Woo Jeong?

647
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,507
My high school friend!

648
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:45,857
Your high school friend?

649
00:47:45,857 --> 00:47:48,297
She's in front of the house.

650
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:50,577
Wait, when did you meet your high school friend?

651
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,247
Recently.

652
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:56,147
Your friend knows you came from the past?

653
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:57,797
I told her.

654
00:47:57,797 --> 00:47:59,087
She believes you?

655
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,657
Of course. She's my friend.

656
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:06,477
What the heck?

657
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:13,227
Woo Jeong!

658
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:15,647
Oh! Hey!

659
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:21,947
So far.

660
00:48:24,547 --> 00:48:26,677
- Let's go inside. 
 - It's okay.

661
00:48:26,677 --> 00:48:28,237
I just stopped by on my way to the café.

662
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:30,817
I told Hyung, so it's okay.

663
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:32,757
Seeing your face is enough.

664
00:48:32,757 --> 00:48:36,737
I dropped by because I was worried I couldn't reach you yesterday.

665
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:40,917
Let's sit over there.

666
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,237
Shall we?

667
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:01,047
We have a lot of coffee at home, too.

668
00:49:01,507 --> 00:49:03,527
What do you want to drink?

669
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:07,757
- Kang San. 
 - Yeah.

670
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:13,537
You should use honorifics when we're in front of other people from now on.

671
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:19,807
Other people will think it's strange of you to speak informally to me.

672
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:25,047
- You think so? 
 - Yes.

673
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:28,087
You call Writer Yook Dong Joo "Hyung," too.

674
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:31,167
I'm just used to it since I called him that from the start.

675
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:34,897
You'll get used to using honorifics with me, too.

676
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:37,277
Then what should I call you?

677
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:41,597
If it makes you uncomfortable, just skip the titles.

678
00:49:43,707 --> 00:49:45,707
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:50,367
Oh, right. Take this with you.

680
00:49:51,677 --> 00:49:53,957
- What is it? 
 - Some side dishes.

681
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,407
- You made them yourself? 
 - No!

682
00:49:57,407 --> 00:50:01,147
I bought them from a popular store. I just did the packaging.

683
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:03,637
That's great. We were just about to have breakfast.

684
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:05,417
You haven't had breakfast yet?

685
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:08,187
I fell asleep at dawn.

686
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:09,987
Thank you for the food.

687
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:12,227
Sure.

688
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:26,527
That punk could make that kind of expression?

689
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:35,507
   

690
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:42,697
This is Yook Dong Joo.

691
00:50:42,697 --> 00:50:44,847
 Is Kang San next to you? 

692
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:48,177
He's not here.

693
00:50:48,937 --> 00:50:51,677
So you believe me now?

694
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:53,637
 Listen to me carefully. 

695
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:57,897
Don't ever tell Kang San you met me.

696
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:00,427
Don't force him to recall his memories, either.

697
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:03,777
 - Excuse me— 
  - If he can live without regaining his memories,

698
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:05,647
that's a blessing for Kang San.

699
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,817
I understand what you're saying,

700
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:12,997
but Kang San has already regained most of his memories and he's aware of what happened in the past.

701
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:15,087
We'll find evidence.

702
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:18,457
- If we find evidence and reveal the truth— 
  - Stop spewing nonsense. 

703
00:51:18,457 --> 00:51:20,977
Why is that nonsense?

704
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,707
Kang San must not be involved in this.

705
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:26,037
I can't stop him when he's set on finding his brother.

706
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:29,047
The truth doesn't matter.

707
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:31,937
It doesn't exist anyway.

708
00:51:31,937 --> 00:51:35,227
- What do you mean? 
 - Lee Ha Neul is dead.

709
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:37,837
He doesn't exist in this world.

710
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:40,927
Are you saying you'll never meet Kang San?

711
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,827
Did you forget I'm a murderer?

712
00:51:43,827 --> 00:51:46,637
What in the world are you thinking?

713
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:49,717
Are you going to see it to the end?

714
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:55,017
You mustn't tell anyone about Kang San's secret.

715
00:51:55,017 --> 00:51:58,077
Help him lead a normal life.

716
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:00,127
Mark my words.

717
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:12,207
   

718
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:15,237
Based on the condition of the teeth, bones, and pelvis,

719
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:17,847
I estimate him to be a man in his 20s or 30s.

720
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:19,637
No possibility of him being in his teens?

721
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:20,707
Not impossible.

722
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:23,467
He was stabbed in the side from behind

723
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:27,517
and based on the damage to his ribs, the stab was deep.

724
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:31,987
Judging by the knife marks on the bone, the internal organ damage was probably severe.

725
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:36,287
There was also a deep stab to the chest, so he most likely died immediately.

726
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:39,087
 That person was stabbed to death. Right? 

727
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:40,747
 What makes you say that? 

728
00:52:40,747 --> 00:52:43,427
 I saw a hand holding a knife. 

729
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:47,437
 And the hand had a cross tattoo. 

730
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:49,447
What's with your expression?

731
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,100
   

732
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:55,057
Please do a DNA match with the skeletal remains.

733
00:52:55,057 --> 00:52:57,357
As soon as possible.

734
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,017
There's a commonality.

735
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:12,987
What are you saying?

736
00:53:12,987 --> 00:53:15,607
Where did you put the toothbrushes?

737
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:18,117
What commonality?

738
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:19,677
What I see and hear.

739
00:53:19,677 --> 00:53:23,237
Regardless of my intentions, it works on some people and not on others.

740
00:53:23,237 --> 00:53:25,707
- And? 
 - There's a commonality.

741
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:29,947
- Which is? 
 - You, your father, and even Woo Jeong...

742
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:32,177
they're all people close to me.

743
00:53:32,177 --> 00:53:35,597
I couldn't see or hear anything from Woo Jeong, either.

744
00:53:35,597 --> 00:53:39,927
It doesn't work on people who were close to you in the past?

745
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,947
I think so.

746
00:53:41,947 --> 00:53:43,757
Why would that be?

747
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:46,787
Maybe because you can recognize the pain and sadness

748
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:50,967
of someone close to you even if you don't have a superpower?

749
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:53,037
I don't think that's the case.

750
00:53:53,037 --> 00:53:56,017
The closer someone is, the harder it is to tell.

751
00:53:56,017 --> 00:53:57,707
That's true.

752
00:53:57,707 --> 00:54:01,487
I didn't recognize my brother's pain, either.

753
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,517
Oh, I have an inspector general's meeting in the afternoon.

754
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:28,467
I heard skeletal remains were discovered.

755
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:34,057
Yeah, I was going to tell you about that.

756
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:37,517
Ha Neul's student ID was found with it.

757
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:39,337
I know.

758
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:44,517
- Where did you hear that? 
 - Wrong question.

759
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:49,687
If Ha Neul is dead, who do you think killed Kyeong Cheol?

760
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:53,507
That's what you should ask.

761
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:57,327
You're right.

762
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:02,227
Yook Dong Joo has an alibi on that day.

763
00:55:02,227 --> 00:55:06,107
I raised a hound growing up.

764
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:09,567
I really adored it.

765
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,977
But it bit my hand by accident.

766
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:18,337
My father killed it right away.

767
00:55:23,027 --> 00:55:26,057
I cried overnight.

768
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:30,817
I was so sad. I still tear up thinking about it.

769
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:35,657
How could you kill a dog just because it bit its owner?

770
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:41,007
My father is quite... cruel, isn't he?

771
00:55:43,227 --> 00:55:44,997
But what else could he do?

772
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:50,397
He could only kill the hound that bit its owner instead of hunting.

773
00:55:50,397 --> 00:55:53,037
Since there are other hounds out there.

774
00:55:57,317 --> 00:55:59,277
Well, that's that.

775
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:03,207
Let me tell you something since you're probably curious.

776
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:05,627
The one who killed Jeon Doo Hyeon...

777
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:09,037
is Byeon Jong Il.

778
00:56:09,037 --> 00:56:10,007
What?

779
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:13,837
Byeon Jong Il sought me out two years ago.

780
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:19,407
He said Jeon Doo Hyeon was blackmailing him and he needed money to shut him up.

781
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:23,447
Byeon Jong Il blackmailed me, too.

782
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:27,147
The hound bit its owner's hand.

783
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:32,337
You're probably aware, but blackmailing doesn't stop after one time.

784
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:39,117
I contemplated what I should do if Byeon Jong Il

785
00:56:39,117 --> 00:56:41,167
sought me out again.

786
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:47,777
But Byeon Jong Il just killed that bastard.

787
00:56:50,017 --> 00:56:51,827
Are you sure?

788
00:56:51,827 --> 00:56:55,037
The guy Byeon Jong Il orders around is my hound.

789
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,887
That hound also killed Noh Myeong Nam.

790
00:57:03,677 --> 00:57:09,047
Kyeong Cheol's wife filed a lawsuit against "Literature and Imagination."

791
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:10,907
Yeah, I saw it on the news.

792
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:14,047
Meet with Kyeong Cheol's wife and deliver this to her.

793
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:42,987
Why... should I?

794
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:44,667
What?

795
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:49,097
I don't think it's something I should do.

796
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:55,897
Myeong Seok can do it. He works at a publishing company.

797
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:57,917
Come on.

798
00:57:57,917 --> 00:58:00,217
We might have different mothers,

799
00:58:00,217 --> 00:58:04,077
but someone from Taekang Group's bloodline shouldn't do it. Right?

800
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:09,457
Then order your secretary to do it. Consider my position.

801
00:58:09,457 --> 00:58:11,317
You do it.

802
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:19,297
The time will be perfect if you leave now.

803
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:22,647
She'll probably be at Taekang Hotel's coffee shop.

804
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:24,177
Go.

805
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,007
Tae Man...

806
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:33,607
Wouldn't it weigh differently if an inspector general handed it over?

807
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,707
She dropped the charges?

808
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:43,627
Yes. Director Shin's attorney just contacted me.

809
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:46,357
What's the reason for her sudden change of heart?

810
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:51,487
He just told me she made the decision out of consideration for Chairman Lee Tae Man.

811
00:58:52,247 --> 00:58:55,807
It's a relief it resolved this easily, but it feels unreal.

812
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,157
That's what I'm saying.

813
00:58:57,157 --> 00:59:00,677
I'll contact Writer Yook since he's probably worried.

814
00:59:00,677 --> 00:59:03,517
It's okay. I'll do that.

815
00:59:03,517 --> 00:59:05,117
All right.

816
00:59:16,107 --> 00:59:19,787
This isn't the story I want.

817
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:33,547
Hello, Secretary Kim, it's Myeong Seok.

818
00:59:33,547 --> 00:59:35,507
How have you been?

819
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:39,097
I'm the same as always.

820
00:59:40,517 --> 00:59:43,877
I'd like to meet with you.

821
00:59:47,227 --> 00:59:48,937
Thank you.

822
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:51,417
Why did you take our toothbrushes?

823
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:53,617
You took them?

824
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,967
I'm sorry about that. I needed his DNA.

825
00:59:58,977 --> 01:00:01,527
Just tell us the results once they're out.

826
01:00:02,797 --> 01:00:06,777
Anyway, what curiosity brought you here today?

827
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:12,307
You said everything you told me yesterday is all true. Right?

828
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:15,147
Yes.

829
01:00:15,147 --> 01:00:17,497
Can you prove it?

830
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:22,817
Who was that person?

831
01:00:22,817 --> 01:00:24,987
What person?

832
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:31,897
 No, Senior! 

833
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,397
 You were crying so heart-wrenchingly. 

834
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:39,467
What are you talking about?

835
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:42,157
You held a bloody man...

836
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,077
in your arms...

837
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:49,487
and were crying heart wrenchingly.

838
01:00:54,477 --> 01:00:58,927
I didn't mean to see it. It's not under my control.

839
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:17,367
Then, when did you two first meet?

840
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:19,747
I told you yesterday.

841
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:25,697
Kang San leaped through time and space at the moment of the accident.

842
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:28,547
Fine.

843
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:31,857
Then, have you ever met Lee Ha Neul?

844
01:01:32,477 --> 01:01:34,807
No.

845
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:39,417
Kang San also recently remembered he had a brother.

846
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:43,087
Then, how did you write that novel?

847
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:48,747
How did you know the hidden truth behind the Sopyeong Lake incident that only the people

848
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:52,577
who were there would know and write a novel about it?

849
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:54,647
Furthermore, the murder cases currently occurring—

850
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:56,427
Excuse me.

851
01:01:57,677 --> 01:02:01,557
I'll tell you everything, so let's talk outside.

852
01:02:01,557 --> 01:02:05,707
- You can talk here. 
 - I said, let's talk outside!

853
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:07,857
I'll tell you!

854
01:02:10,047 --> 01:02:12,667
Hyung did write that novel.

855
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:18,067
I know how Hyung ended up writing it.

856
01:02:20,577 --> 01:02:22,187
Hyung,

857
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:25,097
tell her honestly.

858
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:40,390

867
01:03:07,347 --> 01:03:10,387
 I'm certain Lee Ha Neul left the videotape with my father. 

868
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,187
 What did you watch with this? 

869
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,407
 You should be ashamed of yourself, you filthy bastard. 

870
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,557
 Noh Myeong Nam attempted suicide. 

871
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:18,007
 You said you can see and hear things other people can't. Right? 

872
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:20,647
 Are you asking Kang San to help with your case? 

873
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:23,147
 You're not excluded from the suspect list, either. 

874
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:25,207
 A trash journalist is waking up my fighting spirit. 

875
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:27,547
 We'll do everything in our power. Search every corner. 

876
01:03:27,547 --> 01:03:28,557
 Can I search you? 

877
01:03:28,557 --> 01:03:31,247
 Dragging the police into this isn't a good idea. 

878
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:32,697
 Ha Neul is alive. 

879
01:03:32,697 --> 01:03:36,417
 People who'd do anything for money are everywhere. 

880
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:39,187
 How similar are the Sopyeong Lake incident and the novel? 

881
01:03:39,187 --> 01:03:40,637
 I know who the real culprit is. 

882
01:03:40,637 --> 01:03:43,127
 And the one who covered up that case... 

883
01:03:43,937 --> 01:03:46,327
 If you find it, show it to me, too. 

884
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:47,717
 Sure. 

885
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:49,987
 Look forward to it. 

886
01:03:50,817 --> 01:03:54,627
