1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:02,241
   

2
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:13,891
The bookstore, it was there...

3
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,701
The bookstore... what page...

4
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,661
 Open the door! 

5
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,831
The bookstore, the b-bookstore. It was in there...

6
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,171
   

7
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,781
 What are you doing? 

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,860
   

9
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,881
"It was warm."

10
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,521
 "On the glass wall of the bookstore near the entrance. 

11
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,571
 The posters hang shoulder to shoulder. 

12
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,851
 "Math is best learned with Math Standard." 

13
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:58,151
 "The path to getting an A in English, Sungmoon English." 

14
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:01,991
 With the ad poster for the workbooks in the middle... 

15
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:07,840
 when autumn's sunshine peaked through this busy wall in the afternoon... 

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,181
 It was warm. 

17
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:14,261
 The books are sound asleep, taking naps. 

18
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,641
 Afraid of waking them up, I quietly... 

19
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,721
 and very slowly... 

20
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:25,230
 turn the pages and put down the mountainous weight of my burden I carried for a moment. 

21
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:30,961
 Not even realizing the sun's already crept up to the second bookshelf, 

22
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,811
 I turn the pages. 

23
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,900
 The sunshine spreads in ripples and becomes waves in a river soon. 

24
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:43,381
 The bookstore becomes a gigantic boat, then. 

25
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:49,000
 It's a paper boat sailing through the river with all the books in this world on it. 

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,041
 I turn the pages on that boat as if I'm rowing. 

27
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,061
 Instead of rowing through the water, page by page... 

28
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,561
 I flow along with the water. 

29
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,431
 This is it for today. 

30
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:09,831
 Just like how a sailor puts away his oar after finishing a day's sailing, 

31
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,881
 I neatly put the book I was reading back on the shelf." 

32
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,121
 Do you want to take it and read it? 

33
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,551
 I used to read it, and I just finished reading it. 

34
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:28,470
 Why would you give this to me? 

35
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,080
 After I was done reading it, my heart was wavering. 

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,651
 But there's no one I can talk about it with. 

37
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,860
 Can you read it and have a talk with me? 

38
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,100
 I can't even sell it because I folded the corners anyway. 

39
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:55,871
 Oh, next time. 

40
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:59,041
 Let's go for this book. 

41
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,061
   

42
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,271
 Would it be a little too hard for you? 

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,100
   

44
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:14,540
 "I feel a certain warmth in my hands holding the book. 

45
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:18,381
 That autumn... 

46
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:22,131
 I encountered a moment of pure kindness. 

47
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:24,371
 It was warm. 

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,741
 For the first time in my life." 

49
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:30,171
   

50
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:40,051
But he doesn't mention my father after this.

51
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:45,371
The bag... nor his younger brother going missing are mentioned.

52
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,751
 What are you doing? 

53
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:57,061
That's right.

54
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,671
He couldn't have written about them.

55
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,921
 The manuscript was already in the bag when Father gave the bag to Lee Kang San. 

56
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:11,901
 Even Kai doesn't know... 

57
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,221
 what happened after that. 

58
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,851
 He couldn't write about it. 

59
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,191
 The first act of the novel is the truth about the Lake Sopyeong incident 

60
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:26,101
 Lee Ha Neul witnessed and experienced. 

61
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,571
 The second act is Kai's plans for revenge. 

62
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:46,801
 My father's story goes in between 

63
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,281
 the first and the second act. 

64
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:52,361
 The hidden story even Kai doesn't know. 

65
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,821
Why are you here?

66
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,891
Wh-What's wrong?

67
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,781
Hurry up and get in!

68
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:12,471
He's the one who didn't open the door.

69
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,751
Where are we going?

70
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:34,430
The day you met my fatherâ€”

71
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,620
- It's impossible, but my memory says so. 
 - Of course, it's impossible.

72
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,160
My father died in 1995, and you're in 2022 right now.

73
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,581
I know it's absurd. I admit there's an error in my memories.

74
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,621
It's not an error in your memories,

75
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,951
- it's an error in time. 
 - What do you mean?

76
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,990
Coincidences don't exist in this world!

77
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,791
Things bound to happen end up happening.

78
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,991
Say it so it makes sense to me.

79
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,451
Back to the future. Hey, hang tight!

80
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,841
I know it'll sound like nonsense...

81
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,641
but the story in the novel is happening in reality.

82
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:15,241
Shin Kyeong Cheol's murder scene is exactly the same as if he saw it in person.

83
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,471
Follow me.

84
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:19,531
This isn't a coincidence.

85
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,361
Noh Myeong Nam is the one who sent me this book.

86
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,221
He's trying to tell us the truth that was buried 27 years ago.

87
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,291
Ask for a search warrant, citing the novel as proof!

88
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,891
I'm not saying the novel is the proof!

89
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,871
Nor can I prove how much of it's real and how much of it's made up.

90
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:37,221
The contour of this case becomes clear if we find Na Sang Woo's corpse.

91
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,671
What if we embarrass ourselves after searching the lake and get nothing?

92
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:40,670
What will you do then?

93
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,911
If there is any possibility, isn't it our job to investigate it?

94
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,951
Are you really going to keep this up?

95
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,021
Look here.

96
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:52,231
The evidence, circumstances, and people at the scene all point to the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago!

97
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:55,710
- Do you want to go back to Traffic Division again? 
 - The murders will resume.

98
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,021
Didn't I tell you not to overdo it?

99
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,671
You just got back in the force! Why are you overreacting again?

100
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,171
This is way too far off the grid!

101
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:07,750
If you'll keep this up, take your hands off the case and take a break.

102
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,600
- Team Leader Oh... 
 - Team Leader Oh.

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,881
Take a break and cool down your head.

104
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,641
Let's talk.

105
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:35,591
Did you know about this, Senior?

106
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,581
Aren't you crossing the line here?

107
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:41,920
Of all people, how can you join in on framing our colleague

108
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,720
who went through thick and thin together as a corrupt cop?

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,881
There is evidence.

110
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:54,381
It's me.

111
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,411
I'm the evidence.

112
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:19,001
I looked the other way even after seeing Byeon Jong Il beating up Noh Myeong Nam.

113
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:24,511
I'm saying I kept quiet, even when Noh Myeong Nam's testimony didn't make sense.

114
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,581
I did that.

115
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,581
Why did you become a detective?

116
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,921
 Because my parents were against it. 

117
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,771
 What about you, Senior? 

118
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,081
 Just to save this one person. 

119
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,491
 Who is this one person? 

120
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,860
 Whoever it is and whoever it may be. 

121
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,100
 Somebody once said saving one person equals saving the world. 

122
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,331
 - Who said that? 
 - I'm... definitely not the one. 

123
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,061
 I'm sure someone said it. 

124
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,501
   

125
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,651
   

126
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:52,781
 I'm sorry. 

127
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,201
 Are the rumors true? 

128
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,561
 Did you have a special relationship with my husband? 

129
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,941
 That's not true. 

130
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:05,791
 I didn't. 

131
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,681
 I respected Senior a lot. 

132
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:14,461
 I liked him on my own. Seniorâ€” 

133
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:24,051
 It was our child's birthday. 

134
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,891
 It was his only day off in a year. 

135
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,211
 Only if you hadn't called... 

136
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:33,701
 he wouldn't have gone there. 

137
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,171
 You killed him. 

138
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,881
Sometimes the reality is more unreal.

139
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:09,671
Unfathomable events occur in this world that we live in.

140
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,241
This isn't...

141
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,861
a novel.

142
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,941
Novels can't catch up to reality.

143
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,591
All right. Find Noh Myeong Nam first.

144
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:28,531
Check the CCTVs and search everywhere he might have gone.

145
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,221
Move.

146
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,381
Park Hyeon Soo speaking.

147
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:53,921
Why do you think Jeon Doo Hyeon died?

148
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,921
Who is this?

149
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:07,131
 You're missing something important. 

150
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:13,581
You must become humble, throwing away your arrogance in thinking you got the big picture.

151
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:16,431
That's how you can see the hidden picture.

152
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:21,731
It seems like you want to tell me something. Why don't we meet in person?

153
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:27,221
Regardless of how complicated or how puzzling a problem may be,

154
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:30,631
they all meet at one point down the road.

155
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,781
You know better than anyone.

156
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,821
Money.

157
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,801
   

158
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,091
   

159
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:22,071
Trace the location of the call sender and check who the owner of the phone is.

160
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:25,901
Look up the call history. Though it's probably a prepaid phone, check all that you can.

161
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,131
- Move. 
 - Yes.

162
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,751
Noh Myeong Nam has...

163
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:36,741
kidnapped Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il's daughter.

164
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,331
Weren't we going to Dong Joo Bookstore?

165
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:47,031
Don't set foot outside the car.

166
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:53,751
I might remember something if I go to the bookstore!

167
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,481
- How can we go to a non-existent bookstore? 
 - But I was there!

168
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,371
I also need confirmation to explain the unexplainable!

169
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:01,641
- What's the reason? 
 - What do you mean?

170
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,761
Why can't I see or hear anything from you?

171
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:07,051
Yes. Think about that reason right here.

172
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,941
This is it. Right?

173
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:16,011
- What's up? You didn't even call! 
 - Why aren't you answering your phone?

174
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,391
I was too busy. I didn't hear it.

175
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,121
- Did you eat dinner? 
 - Mom,

176
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:22,131
you said Dad passed away in a car accident. Right?

177
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,231
- Why are you asking that all of a sudden? 
 - How did the accident happen?

178
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,911
- What's the matter? 
 - Did it rain that day?

179
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:31,781
Did it rain with thunder and lightning?

180
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:34,181
That day...

181
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,711
certainly felt out of place.

182
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:40,401
I had a dream where I lost a shoe while walking on a rice fieldâ€”

183
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,651
Gosh!  Did it rain or not?

184
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,621
You're acting really weird!

185
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,921
Stop talking about other stuff. Did it?

186
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:49,011
Gosh! Who do we have here?

187
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:52,161
A star's here today!

188
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,321
I wanted to see you anyway. When did you come?

189
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,321
Just now.

190
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,341
He came suddenly without even telling me.

191
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,491
Mom, I'm askingâ€”

192
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,111
My goodness, look at you now. You look handsome!

193
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,261
He was always handsome.

194
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:07,321
I'm saying he became more handsome!

195
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,031
Do you have a girlfriend?

196
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:11,021
No, that's not...

197
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,811
I have a niece who graduated from Ewha University.

198
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,831
- A med student from Ewha University. 
 - My son isn't picky about women.

199
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,531
Gosh, you have no idea. Kids these days are all about being picky.

200
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,451
Mom, give me one moment.

201
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:34,141
Since you're here, give me an autograph. I want to put it up on the wall and brag.

202
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:37,521
- L-Later. 
 - You're so busy. When will you come back?

203
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:40,251
Just give her one. It's nothing difficult.

204
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,291
It's not like I'm a celebrity.

205
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,521
What do you mean? You're more famous than anyone else here.

206
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:49,021
You even saved a child. You're a total star!

207
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:53,131
I mean, my son is more of a hero than a star.

208
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,961
- Your mom's neck's about to snap. 
 - Why?

209
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,701
Because she's holding her chin up too high.

210
00:16:57,701 --> 00:16:59,781
When did I ever hold my chin up high?

211
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,271
Gosh, your neck's about to straighten itself out!

212
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,161
- Give me paper and a pen! A paper and a pen. 
 - Oh, okay.

213
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,291
Hurry!

214
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,301
Hold on, hold on. Where was the paper?

215
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:09,021
Let's go outside and talk.

216
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,821
- Ma'am! 
 - Yes!

217
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,381
It did rain. With thunder and lightning.

218
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:15,841
- It did? 
 - I told you it did.

219
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:19,301
How did the accident happen?

220
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:22,591
- What's the matter with you? 
 - Did they get the culprit?

221
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,751
Let's talk later.

222
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:27,061
- Yes. 
  - One rolled egg omelet, please. One soju. 

223
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,551
 - Okay. One soju. 
 - Yes. 

224
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:33,761
   

225
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,501
- Hey. 
  - Congrats. 

226
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,061
- For what? 
  - Congratulations, Writer Yook! 

227
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,871
 Congratulations! 

228
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:52,861
Looks like Yook Dong Joo's golden age is right now.

229
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,981
 What's going on? 

230
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:59,061
"God Is Dead" was chosen for this year's...

231
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,501
Korean Literature Prize.

232
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:06,011
- What? 
  - You're now a Korean Literature Prize-winning writer. 

233
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:09,131
The official announcement...

234
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:15,421
will take place within this week,  and they'll contact you separately.

235
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:19,171
 I'm not sure if you're aware of this... 

236
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:24,751
but you're probably the first writer to win the Korean Literature Prize with his debut work.

237
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:30,661
For the most authoritative and conservative literature prize that exists, this result is...

238
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,571
an extremely rare event.

239
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,591
The literature world might also say things...

240
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,181
here and there,

241
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:43,141
but that won't be an issue since it was a unanimous vote by the judges.

242
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:51,191
Right, Deborah Smith contacted us in person.

243
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,991
- Who is that person? 
 - Did you even know that...

244
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:56,551
- "The Vegetarian" win the Man Booker Prize? 
 - I know.

245
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,441
She's the translator who translated that book.

246
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:05,001
She said she wants to translate "God Is Dead" and spread it all over the world.

247
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:10,271
 She also said she wants to meet you in person and discuss your work. 

248
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,061
 This is dangerous. 

249
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:19,781
 The sun is too close to me. 

250
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:28,321
 If I get closer to the sun... 

251
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,951
 the wax on the wings I stole will melt away. 

252
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:36,251
Hey, are you speechless from the shock?

253
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:38,171
Hello?

254
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:41,611
Hey, Yook Dong Joo, you need to say somethingâ€”

255
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,241
H-Hello?

256
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:46,541
Helloâ€”

257
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:51,741
He hung up on me again. What an asshole.

258
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,651
Gosh, he keeps hanging up on me.

259
00:19:55,651 --> 00:20:01,001
 As I excavate the truth, I get closer to the sun and... 

260
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,561
 I'll plummet in the end. 

261
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:06,291
 My life is over at that point as well. 

262
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,981
What are you doing?

263
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:14,241
 Back to when I was poor and shabby,  no... 

264
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:18,811
 I won't go back to a worse state than what it used to be. 

265
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,761
 Never. 

266
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,511
Come in.

267
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,231
Mom...

268
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:30,911
- Move. 
 - Move?

269
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:34,031
Your place is old and moldy without any sunlight.

270
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:37,131
I'll give you the money.

271
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,851
That's fine.

272
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:42,291
Moving costs a lot of money.

273
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,241
Look for a place.

274
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,811
I'll get going.

275
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,941
â™«  I tell the mirror  â™«

276
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:50,491
Watch out for the traffic!

277
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:53,311
Get in.

278
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:58,421
- I said get in. 
 - Who's that lady?

279
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:03,031
You wanted to go to Dong Joo Bookstore. Right?

280
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,621
Get in.

281
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,611
 My condition is simple. 

282
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:32,860
 I want Byeon Jong Il to confess to the media that he framed me by forcing a false confession 

283
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,700
 through cruel torture and blackmailing 27 years ago to fabricate the Lake Sopyeong incident. 

284
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,700
 And have it broadcasted on JBC's 9:00 news tonight. 

285
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,421
What's this bloody murderer going on about?

286
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:49,561
 The moment I confirm the broadcast, I'll release his daughter safely and turn myself in. 

287
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,521
 Kidnapping is a serious crime. 

288
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:56,091
-  At least for yourselfâ€”  
  - One hour and 50 minutes remain until 9:00. 

289
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:01,011
 If he doesn't fulfill my condition, his daughter will die. 

290
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:06,070
 I'm telling you in advance for your convenience. This phone is his daughter's. 

291
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,811
 Noh Myeong Nam... 

292
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,931
 Noh Myeong Nam! 

293
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:18,990
When was the last time you saw your daughter today?

294
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:26,281
She went out last night and...

295
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:30,360
Are you saying she hasn't come home since last night?

296
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:37,561
Yes.

297
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:41,680
At night. So around 11:00 p.m.

298
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,351
Didn't she say where she was going?

299
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,161
No.

300
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:50,341
Is this a recent picture of your daughter?

301
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:51,521
Yes.

302
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,501
The call was made from a place with lots of foot traffic, and since it's night...

303
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:58,811
there's absolutely not enough time to specify Noh Myeong Nam and pinpoint his location.

304
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,991
Finding Noh Myeong Nam before 9:00 is impossible.

305
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:05,941
There's no other way as things stand.

306
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:08,811
I talked to Noh Myeong Nam's psychiatrist on the phone.

307
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:10,771
 Psychiatrist? 

308
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:13,311
Noh Myeong Nam has been suffering from severe depression.

309
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,551
 And? 

310
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:18,251
He had an extreme obsession with taking care of his garden.

311
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,741
But Noh Myeong Nam doesn't have a garden under his name.

312
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,471
If it's somewhere he frequents, it must be near his home.

313
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,961
Okay.

314
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:29,461
Share this with the search team.

315
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:31,021
Okay.

316
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh, right. The call you received earlier.

317
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,931
I think he called you while moving on the subway.

318
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,801
It must be a subway without CCTVs.

319
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,821
Probably.

320
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:47,290
Could he be Noh Myeong Nam's accomplice?

321
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,700
Seeing how they called you and Detective Park at similar times...

322
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,061
Share the picture first.

323
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:07,421
Did you identify Noh Myeong Nam's location?

324
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:09,201
I think it'll take some time.

325
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:11,451
Call reinforcements. Tell National Investigations to join, too.

326
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,281
W-Wait, never mind.

327
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,741
We can't make it too big.

328
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,091
The reporters are unaware. Right?

329
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,510
- We're progressing quietly, butâ€” 
 - Keep everything low.

330
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,271
The reporters absolutely can't know about this.

331
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:27,951
The Violent Crimes Team has been utilized to the max, but...

332
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:32,131
finding your daughter by 9:00 seems physically impossible.

333
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:34,351
We should do a public investigationâ€”

334
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:36,491
Do you want to get fired?

335
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:41,691
If my daughter is harmed, know that all of you'll get fired.

336
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:46,211
This is why they say police are incompetent. What are you doing here?

337
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:49,251
Go out and get me that bloody murderer!

338
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:53,901
Can't you... just do as he said?

339
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:55,481
What?

340
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,871
He said he'll kill Ha Young.

341
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,751
Please just do as he said, Darling.

342
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:01,761
Have you gone mad?

343
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:07,420
I'll beg of you. Please do as he said.

344
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:19,631
No matter what happens... we can't negotiate with a criminal.

345
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:22,711
Nothing's more precious than Ha Young's life.

346
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,951
There's no time.

347
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:33,411
What are you trying to say?

348
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:35,921
What Noh Myeong Nam wants...

349
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,131
is an apology.

350
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,591
I did nothing wrong! Why should I apologize!

351
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,561
Assemblyman, please calm down.

352
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,811
Noh Myeong Nam is a murderer.

353
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,531
The investigation was fair and just!

354
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:52,841
You know better than anyone that there was no blackmailing or assault involved!

355
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:56,031
Ha Young's life is on the line. Before it's too lateâ€”

356
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:59,670
Even at gunpoint, I won't compromise with injustice.

357
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,701
Me!

358
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,560
This Byeon Jong Il has lived a life without a speck of shame by the heavens!

359
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,060
Heaven and Earth know that I have lived all my life...

360
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:16,240
making sacrifices for this country's justice and the people's well-being!

361
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:21,291
Assemblyman...

362
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:43,131
You said we were going to Dong Joo Bookstore.

363
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:47,861
That's where Dong Joo Bookstore used to be.

364
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:50,681
Before it was taken down for redevelopment.

365
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:53,161
Then, what am I remembering?

366
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,210
I told you. Right? The past doesn't matter.

367
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,411
Live in the present.

368
00:26:57,411 --> 00:27:01,410
Just look ahead without looking back for your happiness in life.

369
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,871
What the heck are you saying?

370
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,231
Do you know why a miracle happened to you?

371
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:07,001
God gave you a chance.

372
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,301
It's a chance to live happily, making only happy memories from now on.

373
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:12,491
That's why a miracle happened to you.

374
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:15,081
- Stop this nonsense. 
 - Think about it.

375
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:17,091
Why did your memories disappear?

376
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:19,861
That's a prophecy from God telling you not to remember. Why would that be?

377
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:22,011
Because they're painful and sad memories.

378
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:26,691
They say humans erase painful memories on our own, even without divine intervention.

379
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:30,321
- What are you trying to do? 
 - I'm saying this genuinely for your good.

380
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:34,461
Stop getting involved with other people's pain when you can't even take care of your own life.

381
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:38,291
Just think about yourself, live for yourself, and live for your happiness!

382
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,951
- It's my life. 
 - Your life is also my life!

383
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,351
- Hyung! 
 - You're starting anew.

384
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:47,220
Get an ID with Gi Jeok as your name and attend school. I'll do that for you.

385
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,931
You're hiding something from me. Right?

386
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:52,990
- What would I hide from you? 
 - You are.

387
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,790
- Tell me the truth. 
 - Where's the truth?

388
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,921
All right, there is one.

389
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:02,060
- That finding out the truth is impossible. 
 - I have a brother!

390
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,370
I must meet my brother. I must find my brother!

391
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,801
That's why truth makes you uncomfortable.

392
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,431
Truth only makes you uncomfortable the more you know.

393
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:13,591
With your power, you can make a lot of money, too!

394
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,301
Stop wasting your power on people who won't be of any help to you!

395
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:21,091
Make a good plan, and you can rake in money!

396
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,851
- What a piece of trash. 
 - Wh-What?

397
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:26,271
I just want to know who I am.

398
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,911
Whether painful or bad memories, that's who I am.

399
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:33,081
Live in the present? God's prophecy?

400
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,681
Cut the bullshit.

401
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:38,511
- Hey, how dare youâ€” 
 - How can I live the present without knowing who I am?

402
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:41,581
How can I be happy without knowing who I am?

403
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:46,450
If you love money that much, go ahead and make tons of it, you damn asshole!

404
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,560
   

405
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:28,251
 Please help me. 

406
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,981
Are you okay?

407
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:48,971
- The lady is in danger. 
 - Wh-What?

408
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:51,411
We're going to lose them. Hurry!

409
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:56,161
- Hey, you cursed at me just now andâ€” 
 - Hurry up!

410
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:05,791
Have you tried persuading Byeon Jong Il?

411
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,681
He's stubborn.

412
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:12,251
Anyway, request support from a nearby district if anything happens.

413
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:26,561
We discovered something strange on the CCTV in front of the house.

414
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:27,961
What do you mean strange?

415
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:31,120
Assemblyman Byeon's daughter acted strange when she left through the front door.

416
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,301
How so?

417
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:35,520
It seemed like she was running away.

418
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,981
She also looked very ragged.

419
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,261
   

420
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:13,751
Wow, it's like a horror movie here.

421
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:24,860
   

422
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:30,831
What will you do without a plan?

423
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:32,701
He hit a woman with a golf club.

424
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:35,651
She rode on his motorcycle. With her hands around his waist, too.

425
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:37,631
She asked for help.

426
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,391
You teleported before, but you couldn't today.

427
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:43,621
It's ominous. I think something's off.

428
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:49,731
Hey, we're not the police, nor did we witness the assault.

429
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:54,441
You shouldn't catch people's eyes. You'll be at risk in there.

430
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,431
Why don't you go and make more money, Hyung?

431
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,541
All right.

432
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:05,491
Hey, let's do this then.

433
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,650
Apologize for your rude words.

434
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,420
Apologizing takes courage, too.

435
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,421
- I'm sorry. 
 - Sorry doesn't cover it.

436
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,831
How do you know the woman was assaulted?

437
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:29,541
Well, it's a bit hard to explain...

438
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:31,771
I saw it.

439
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:34,651
- You witnessed it? 
 - He hit the woman with a golf club.

440
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,431
And she asked me for help.

441
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:37,691
Really?

442
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:39,901
Wait, s-so what h-he means isâ€”

443
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,191
Hey, let's go.

444
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:43,561
Wait, hold onâ€”

445
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,151
Geez, I give up.

446
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:14,951
Wait! Maybe no one's in there?

447
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,581
That's definitely the motorcycle.

448
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:23,421
 Who is it? 

449
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:28,801
It's the police.

450
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:31,281
 What's the matter? 

451
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,391
Motorcycle!

452
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:39,551
You're the owner of the motorcycle 5032, right?

453
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:42,101
 I am. 

454
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:45,251
We received a hit-and-run report.

455
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:48,611
The victim is present as well.

456
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:04,031
Are you hurt?

457
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:10,601
I didn't know I hit you.

458
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:14,201
The woman's inside, isn't she?

459
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:18,781
We already know everything! Open the door!

460
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,641
Hey! Hey!

461
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:41,611
Don't be afraid! It's the police!

462
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,291
Are you all right?

463
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:23,961
Back away before this gets ugly.

464
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,321
Why are you doing this?

465
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:34,341
You can't do this.

466
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,681
You shouldn't do this.

467
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:40,581
Don't resist and come with me quietly.

468
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:48,931
You've been assaulted by this man. Right?

469
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,561
Don't worry, and tell me honestly.

470
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,691
There's a witness, so you can rest assured and testify.

471
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:59,951
The wounds on your face...

472
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:03,351
This man inflicted them on you. Correct?

473
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:10,081
We'll protect you, so don't be afraid.

474
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:11,921
If you can confirm and file a reportâ€”

475
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:14,221
It's not this man.

476
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:18,791
Who was it?

477
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,211
The one who hit you with a golf club.

478
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,071
That man.

479
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:31,061
   

480
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,971
   

481
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:29,761
   

482
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:37,481
Hey, what's going on? Who was it if it wasn't that man?

483
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,091
Tell me who it was if you know!

484
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:44,761
Putting us aside, if that man decides to sue,

485
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,331
it'll be troublesome for Yong Dae.

486
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:54,621
Damn it, I'm going nuts.

487
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,771
   

488
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:00,271
I'm sorry.

489
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:03,371
There seems to have been a mistake.

490
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:06,531
I'm very sorry, sir.

491
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:13,381
But... what's your relationship with that lady?

492
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:18,091
Judging by her wounds, it does seem like she's been assaulted.

493
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:24,521
   

494
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,431
You.

495
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,761
What's your identity?

496
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:19,851
 Greetings, everyone. This is News Nine. 

497
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:24,921
 A man who recently sexually assaulted a woman and even threatened the victim 

498
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:28,391
 to spread a video of the assaultâ€” 

499
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,141
Assemblyman Byeon!

500
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:02,621
Assemblyman Byeon!

501
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,461
Who are you?

502
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:51,471
Gosh! I'm sorry.

503
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:53,281
Please excuse us.

504
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,351
Come here.

505
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:57,841
I'm very sorry.

506
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,581
 Who was it? 

507
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:08,661
 The one who hit you with a golf club. 

508
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,391
 That man. 

509
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:28,561
- Hold on! 
 - What now?

510
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:32,201
- I'll return her handkerchief. 
 - Wait here! I'll returnâ€” Gi Jeok!

511
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,571
Hey.

512
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:35,751
- What's with him? 
 - Huh?

513
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:37,981
He said he witnessed the assault firsthand.

514
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:40,311
With a golf club?

515
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:44,401
Well, rather than witness it firsthand...

516
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,811
h-he made an e-error.

517
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,551
What error?

518
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:53,561
Well... a misunderstanding of sorts?

519
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:56,301
What kind of misunderstanding is that specific?

520
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:57,731
Here.

521
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,661
Let's talk.

522
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,361
- Just the two of us. 
 - Talk here.

523
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:14,841
I just need a moment.

524
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:20,441
You can think of it as an aftereffect of the accident.

525
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,531
Another aftereffect besides memory loss?

526
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,990
Something like that. You should go for now.

527
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,720
The thing that came from his mouth...

528
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:30,311
That's also an aftereffect. You're busy, so get going!

529
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:33,301
Wait! Wait! Something's strange.

530
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,751
Everything's strange.

531
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,401
That TV is strange, too.

532
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:39,441
Just go. I need to get him before he causes more trouble.

533
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:41,091
And you know what?

534
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,330
You're the strangest one.

535
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:45,981
W-What about me?

536
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:50,891
Hey! Stop changing the subject and explain. So I can understand.

537
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:53,181
I just feel unsettled.

538
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:58,361
- You won't understand even if I explain. 
 - Hey...

539
00:42:58,361 --> 00:43:01,361
I'd understand even if you killed somebody.

540
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,381
We're the best of best friends, aren't we?

541
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:15,411
To be honest, he has...

542
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,611
supernatural powers.

543
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:32,721
He sees what others can't. What's more shocking is... he came from the pastâ€”

544
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:34,501
I'll get going.

545
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,071
Seriously...

546
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:45,701
It was your father, wasn't it?

547
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:49,351
You've been assaulted by your father.

548
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:53,281
How do you know?

549
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:56,091
That's not important.

550
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,991
The important thing is what you want.

551
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,251
Should I kill him for you?

552
00:44:08,671 --> 00:44:10,711
You want revenge, don't you?

553
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:14,991
You wish he were dead.

554
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:24,951
A person shouldn't do that to another person.

555
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:31,981
Furthermore, someone who does that to his own child... deserves to die.

556
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,541
He has no reason to live.

557
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,781
Why did you come here?

558
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:50,571
Oh, gosh. Was there an accident?

559
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:54,061
- He must've hurt his head. 
 - Is he dead?

560
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:03,771
It'll get noisy if photos leak on social media.

561
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,011
It's a fight against time.

562
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:08,121
Expand the area for an urgent wanted list and get all the police force out there.

563
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:11,111
Understood. But why did his wife do that?

564
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:13,061
Get moving!

565
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:21,941
You're my boulder of the sanctuary. You're my shield.

566
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:25,651
You're the horn of my salvation. You're my refuge.

567
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:29,901
You're my savior. You have saved me from evil.

568
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:34,161
Please save me from Satan, and Ha Young...

569
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:37,781
Please save Ha Young.

570
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:39,661
Our Ha Young...

571
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:45,831
Please save her.

572
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:49,391
What are you doing?

573
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,111
What do you mean, why did I come?

574
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:02,481
Why did you tail me?

575
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:05,101
I think there's a misunderstanding.

576
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:07,111
Like we said, we misunderstood the situation.

577
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:09,411
You're Writer Yook Dong Joo, aren't you?

578
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:18,691
Well, I am Yook Dong Joo...

579
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:22,471
But I don't have ulterior motives, nor did I tail you. Why would I?

580
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:23,991
It doesn't matter.

581
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:25,371
W-What?

582
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:28,001
None of it matters now.

583
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:32,071
I have no idea what you're saying right now.

584
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:35,001
- You know everything. 
 - I-I do?

585
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,561
Help me.

586
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:42,731
Excuse me!

587
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:06,521
I didn't kill anyone.

588
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:09,091
But they won't believe me.

589
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:12,021
They'll frame me again.

590
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:14,401
Please help me. I can't suffer twice.

591
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,741
Whoa, wait a minute.

592
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:17,771
Share the truth you know with the world.

593
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:19,711
- Wait, hold onâ€” 
 - I beg of you.

594
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,711
Yook Dong Joo, you're the only one who can help meâ€”

595
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:23,741
Please hear me out first! Gosh!

596
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,761
Seriously, gosh.

597
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:31,261
I don't know why you're doing this to me, but I don't know who you are.

598
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:36,171
- You don't know me? 
 - I just met you today, so of course not! Are you drunk?

599
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:37,001
What?

600
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:42,361
It seems you've experienced some injustice, but please first calm down.

601
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:48,311
Why are you doing this?

602
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,981
That's my line! Why in the world are you doing this to me?

603
00:47:51,981 --> 00:47:54,881
- How could you not know me? 
 - How would I know you?

604
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,481
You wrote it in the novel!

605
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:05,501
What happened at... Sopyeong Lake 27 years ago...

606
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:08,471
You wrote everything in the novel.

607
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:20,061
   

608
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,361
   

609
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:32,471
Daegok District, this is Sergeant Jeong Yong Dae!

610
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:36,421
The wanted suspect, Noh Myeong Nam located! Requesting backup immediately!

611
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,681
Have you seen him?

612
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:50,171
Did something happen to this person?

613
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,241
Do you know him?

614
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:56,881
He gardens here, so I run into him sometimes.

615
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:00,331
Is his individual container located nearby?

616
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,751
No.

617
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:06,871
Excuse me.

618
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:08,911
Yes.

619
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:11,321
What location?

620
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:14,741
I'll head over right away.

621
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:33,411
Yeah.

622
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:41,681
   

623
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:45,671
Pick up, Dong Joo. Please pick up your phone!

624
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:51,601
You know the truth.

625
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:56,691
You're aware of everything that happened there.

626
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,161
Didn't you write that novel to reveal the truth?

627
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:01,981
No.

628
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:04,751
I...

629
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:09,081
I just wrote a novel.

630
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:13,231
An ordinary novel that has nothing to do... with the truth.

631
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:17,131
- It's just a novel? 
 - Yes! It's just a novel.

632
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:19,891
It's just a novel based on the...

633
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,081
- Sopyeong Lake incident. 
 - Why are you lying?

634
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:26,481
It's up to you whether you believe me or not. So think whatever you want.

635
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,811
- The content of the novel is true! 
 - Fine!

636
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:32,191
Let's say it's the truth like you claim.

637
00:50:32,191 --> 00:50:34,251
What does that change?

638
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,411
The novel won't turn into evidence,

639
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:40,491
nor can you testify anything with pure fiction!

640
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:44,161
The videotape.

641
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,621
V-Videotape?

642
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:48,171
I saw it.

643
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,811
What?

644
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:52,381
I couldn't tell what I was watching at the time.

645
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,231
I realized this after reading the novel.

646
00:50:56,231 --> 00:50:59,161
"Oh, those bastards were recording a video at the time."

647
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:01,191
"That was the source of light."

648
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:05,211
That tape.

649
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:10,041
You have it, don't you? You watched it!

650
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:14,361
Why didn't you fight back then?

651
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:17,571
You said you saw everything.

652
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:19,921
You said you knew the truth!

653
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:21,781
Then you should've fought with all your strength!

654
00:51:21,781 --> 00:51:24,261
You should've revealed the truth, then!

655
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:27,281
Why suffer like an idiot? Why?

656
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:34,861
Take responsibility for your own life, mister!

657
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:39,001
I never had any interest in the truth from the start!

658
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:40,961
Because my life is so burdensome,

659
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:45,191
I have no reason or leisure to take responsibility for your delusion!

660
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:51,351
And the statute of limitations is long overdue.

661
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:56,351
You should just forget everything and live in the present, too! Okay?

662
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:03,571
Geez, you scared me. What are you doing?

663
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:46,141
 Kill him! 

664
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:50,171
 What are you looking at? 

665
00:52:50,171 --> 00:52:51,751
 Damn it. 

666
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:25,051
 Get it together. 

667
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:32,751
 All right, let's go through everything. 

668
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,881
 You fought with Joo Jin Seong, who's now dead. 

669
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:38,981
 You know Joo Jin Seong, right? The homeless man you killed while drunk. 

670
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,601
 Why did you fight? 

671
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:44,771
 Because of the space you claimed. 

672
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:46,521
 Where was that space? 

673
00:53:48,941 --> 00:53:52,221
 The bench at Sopyeong Lake. 

674
00:53:52,221 --> 00:53:53,601
 That's right. 

675
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:55,631
 Which is why you got furious. 

676
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:59,811
 Joo Jin Seong looked down on you all the time. Right? 

677
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:01,601
 Detective... 

678
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:04,541
 I really didn't kill him. 

679
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,801
 There's a witness! 

680
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,241
 I told you I saw the culprits. 

681
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,881
 There were several of them, not just one. 

682
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:23,981
 Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit... bullshit, bullshit... 

683
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,631
 You littleâ€” 

684
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:42,021
 Ending this faster will be easier for you. 

685
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:45,001
 You can't even sleep. Look at you. 

686
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:04,881
 Shall we start from the beginning? 

687
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:21,121
 Let's wrap this up... so you can get some sleep. All right? 

688
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,111
 What are you doing, mister? 

689
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:59,711
 Mister is a detective. You've seen me before. Right? 

690
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:03,021
 What's in there? 

691
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:09,281
 It's a secret you saw me. kay? 

692
00:56:09,281 --> 00:56:11,211
 Why? 

693
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:14,831
 It's a secret operation. 

694
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:18,691
 You mustn't tell secrets. Even to your mom. 

695
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,311
 Gosh. 

696
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,891
 Good boy. 

697
00:56:35,631 --> 00:56:38,091
He disappeared.

698
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:40,941
He just disappeared.

699
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:43,171
Don't move!

700
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,451
Slowly raise your hands above your head.

701
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:55,341
What's wrong? What's the matter?

702
00:57:19,621 --> 00:57:21,921
You attend church?

703
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,021
I don't believe in God.

704
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:35,321
It's all over.

705
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:39,521
The police will be here soon, so give up and turn yourself in.

706
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:44,241
If you do, extenuating circumstances will be considered.

707
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:48,391
Yong Dae, put down the gun for nowâ€”

708
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:50,071
Whoa! What? What?

709
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:51,631
Get behind me.

710
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:56,861
Byeon Ha Young, slowly get behind me.

711
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:59,301
Don't move!

712
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:02,611
It's okay.

713
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:06,081
Don't worry, and come this way.

714
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:13,251
Wait... What's going on?

715
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,991
What did you do?

716
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:18,471
Abduction is a serious crime.

717
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:22,291
It's not too late yet. If you turn yourself in...

718
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,641
extenuating circumstances will be considered.

719
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:31,111
I did it.

720
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:34,861
What do you mean?

721
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:37,711
I asked him to do this.

722
00:58:37,711 --> 00:58:40,351
I planned everything.

723
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,231
Mister is innocent.

724
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:58,551
- Even so, how could you do this? 
 - The police will be here soon. Right?

725
00:58:58,551 --> 00:59:00,301
Yeah.

726
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:03,961
Anyway, if everything you just said is true,

727
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:06,341
extenuating circumstances will be considered.

728
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:10,061
The police in charge will be here soon, so trust them and...

729
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:11,791
By the way, where did he go?

730
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:14,221
Yong Dae...

731
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:20,401
you said you'd understand no matter what I say. Right?

732
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:42,090


733
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:48,241
   
 (Sounds like Gi Jeok.) 

734
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:55,351
Pick up, pick up.

735
01:00:04,981 --> 01:00:08,061
Gosh, where did he disappear to?

736
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:27,721
â™«  Shout out loud  â™«

737
01:00:27,721 --> 01:00:31,681
â™«  On your two faces covered by darkness  â™«

738
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:36,041
â™«  Venom  â™«

739
01:00:38,021 --> 01:00:40,081
â™«  Those hypocrisies  â™«

740
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:43,641
   

741
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:46,521
 I'm a time traveler. 

742
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,891
 Is lying a habit of yours? 

743
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:51,551
 I have a supernatural power. 

744
01:00:51,551 --> 01:00:54,121
 The friend you said looks a lot like me... 

745
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,451
 I want to meet him. 

746
01:00:57,751 --> 01:00:59,531
 He's gone. 

747
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,311
 He disappeared. 

748
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,931
 - Did you meet God? 
 - Sorry? 

749
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:04,281
 Where can I go to meet him? 

750
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:06,681
 Tell the person who wrote this novel. 

751
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:09,541
 That I waited 27 years. 

752
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,671
 Welcome. 

753
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,911
 There was a fellow who was an excellent writer. 

754
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:18,841
 If he wrote a novel, I surmise he would've written a lot like Writer Yook. 

755
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,631
 Let's go. Whatever fate awaits me. 

756
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:26,381
â™«  Your dark face that hides the world  â™«

757
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:27,631
â™«  Venom  â™«
