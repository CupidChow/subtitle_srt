1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,900
Young man!

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,340
My name...

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,550
is Lee Kang San.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:25,990
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

5
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,010
 My name... 

6
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,370
 is Lee Kang San. 

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,910
Kang San!

8
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,570
 Kang San! 

9
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,620
But there's no way.

10
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,750
    
 Gosh, this kid.

11
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,230
How's he going around without any money?

12
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,430
Gosh, seriously.

13
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,080
What was that?

14
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,230
God's hand?

15
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,560
 Did you meet god? 

16
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,570
 Tell the person who wrote this novel. 

17
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,950
 That I waited 27 years. 

18
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,820
   

19
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,750
Where are you?

20
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,390
The police station. I came to write a testimony regarding Noh Myeong Nam.

21
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,510
I was going to call you about this.

22
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,870
What's the situation with Noh Myeong Nam right now?

23
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,310
He refused to testify? Why?

24
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,540
I don't know the details because I only heard about it, too.

25
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm sure he'll get released soon.

26
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,490
The daughter's the accomplice. Would a father lock up his daughter?

27
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,640
On top of that, he's an assemblyman.

28
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,370
He'll try to cover it up for sure since domestic abuse is the cause.

29
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,790
More importantly, your mother called the police because of a burglary.

30
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,630
Burglary?

31
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,490
What about Mom? I-Is my mom okay?

32
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,580
 Yes, she's okay. 

33
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,100
- What did they steal? 
  - Nothing. 

34
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,790
Nothing?

35
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,880
- They didn't steal anything? 
 - They did look through stuff.

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,490
But stuff like gold rings and necklaces are all there. Weird, right?

37
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,670
- It's weird. 
  - There's one more weird thing. 

38
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,970
- What is it? 
 - Your mother saw the thief's license plate number.

39
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,280
But it's a stolen car.

40
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,420
- A stolen car? 
  - Meaning this isn't simple burglary. 

41
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,660
 Couldn't it be the guy who broke into your study? 

42
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,260
- The same guy? 
 - He didn't steal anything, either, right?

43
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,100
Don't you have any clue about this?

44
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,850
You do, right?

45
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,090
- I do. 
 - You do?

46
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,360
- The proof. 
  - What proof? 

47
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,000
It's hard to explain over the phone.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,130
I'm going to go to my mom, so look into how Noh Myeong Nam is doing.

49
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,680
Why do you care about him to ask me to check in on him?

50
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,370
I have my reasons. Thank you.

51
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,810
These people are really crossing the line.

52
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,460
It's only an estimate based on numbers.

53
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,760
So he won't look exactly the same, but his image should be similar.

54
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay. Of course, things can differ based on external circumstances,

55
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,920
accidents, or health conditions.

56
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,180
But he should still look and feel similar. Right?

57
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,340
If not for accidents or plastic surgery.

58
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,290
- He does look familiar. 
 - Because that's a common face.

59
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh, and the CCTV you asked about last time.

60
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,700
- Did you recover it? 
 - I tried to recover at least parts of it.

61
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,930
But it was totally gone from the electrocution. Here.

62
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,210
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

63
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Hello?

64
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,920
Are you Detective Park Hyeon Soo?

65
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
 Yes. Who is this? 

66
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm...

67
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,680
- the one who got hit by a car. 
 - Oh, I know you.

68
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,690
I was curious. Are you doing well?

69
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,400
Hello?

70
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,450
If I tell you my name, can you find my family?

71
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,580
You remember your name now?

72
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,320
I think so.

73
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,730
You think so? What do you mean?

74
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,160
Because I shouldn't be here...

75
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,490
if what I remember is correct.

76
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,660
What are you saying?

77
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,910
- Can we meet right now? 
 - Right now?

78
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,410
Meeting right now is a bit difficult for me.

79
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,730
- You can't tell me over the phone? 
 - I think I should tell you in person.

80
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,530
I don't think I have time today.

81
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,910
What's the name you remember? I'll put the request in first for now.

82
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,640
 Hello? 

83
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,890
- It's Lee Kang San. 
  - Lee Kang San? 

84
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,060
Yes.

85
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,740
It's Lee Kang San.

86
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,280
Do a background check for me. The name's Lee Kang San, a male.

87
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,290
He doesn't have a registered fingerprint, and he's about 18 to 19 years old.

88
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,540
Set the region to Seoul.

89
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,890
Yes. Thank you.

90
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,200
Congrats!

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,180
- For what? 
 - I heard you arrested the serial killer, huh?

92
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,430
- What are you talking about? 
 - Isn't Noh Myeong Nam, the kidnapper, the culprit?

93
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,060
Who said that?

94
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,470
I heard Detective Kang said that.

95
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,430
Isn't it true?

96
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,870
 You're missing something important. 

97
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,450
 You must become humble, throwing away your arrogance in thinking you got the big picture. 

98
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,190
 That's how you can see the hidden picture. 

99
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,060
Why?

100
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,020
Why are you studying a two-year-old case so hard?

101
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,670
- I feel like I missed something. 
 - What is it?

102
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,740
Step outside and have a word with me.

103
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,490
Do it here.

104
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,710
Is there proof Noh Myeong Nam killed Jeon Doo Hyeon and Shin Kyeong Cheol?

105
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,950
What are you saying?

106
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,720
The entire police station is talking about how serial killer Noh Myeong Nam was arrested.

107
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,550
Are you saying I spread that rumor?

108
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,220
That's not the point here.

109
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,510
Since we're on the topic, I'll find the evidence for you.

110
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,820
That Noh Myeong Nam is the culprit.

111
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,620
Do you plan to force him to confess after deciding he's guilty?

112
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,610
Hey...

113
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,960
Are you better than everyone here?

114
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,870
How dare you step out of your line and lecture your senio.

115
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,310
Hyungnim, it was my mistake.

116
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,420
It was me. I-I made a mistake.

117
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,800
I went to the cafeteria, and the juniors asked me.

118
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,850
So I just said Noh Myeong Nam is a possible suspect.

119
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,150
He has the motive, and Detective Kang is also sure.

120
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,380
But they wouldn't believe me, so I sold Detective Kang out a little.

121
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,220
Gosh, I also really hate myself.

122
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,080
This blabbermouth! My mouth is the problem. I'm the crazy one.

123
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,690
It was my mistake. I'm sorry.

124
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,810
Mistake, my ass.

125
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,100
That bastard is the real culprit.

126
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,220
Whether it was staged or not, he threatened Byeon Jong Il to tell the truth about the Lake Sopyeong incident

127
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,520
and has the motive to kill Jeon Doo Hyeon, the witness of the Lake Sopyeong incident.

128
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,920
- What more do you need? 
 - We've neither evidence nor a confession.

129
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,400
- Noh Myeong Nam also has rights— 
 - Do you think you're all that?

130
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,160
When you were rolling your pen on a desk, I rolled on dirt to evade knives.

131
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,740
Rights? That's for humans, not fuckers who kill people!

132
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,700
What are you all doing?

133
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,180
These bastards, seriously...

134
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,170
Wait, calm—

135
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,610
Great going, huh? How great!

136
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,300
- We've got great teamwork— 
 - Team Leader Oh!

137
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,490
- Don't discriminate based on sex. 
 - I'll just sew your mouth shut.

138
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,640
- What only me? 
 - I told you to watch your mouth.

139
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,280
Don't you know the situation right now?

140
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,180
Why are you spewing nonsense when the journalists are riled up because of the serial killer?

141
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,780
Do you want to stop working? Should I help you out?

142
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,070
I can't believe all of you.

143
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,300
Who are you?

144
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm Sergeant Jeong Yong Dae.

145
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,670
I came to write the material witness statement.

146
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,470
Since when were you there?

147
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,800
- Well, the thing is... 
 - Please come back in later.

148
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,290
Yes.

149
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,500
Why is everything all over the place?

150
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,080
Go out and get statements from Noh Myeong Nam and Byeon Ha Young first.

151
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,800
I'll go see Noh Myeong Nam.

152
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,390
Noh Myeong Nam said he didn't even want to talk to you.

153
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,370
   

154
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,610
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

155
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,390
I must confirm something. It'll be quick.

156
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,100
   

157
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,870
Tell that man to get out.

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,140
Do you know what this is?

159
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,420
- You don't seem to know. 
 - Are you kidding me?

160
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,420
Everyone knows that it's a cross.

161
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,750
Is it just a cross to you?

162
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Do you expect me to confess my sins?

163
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,460
To force a confession out of me again?

164
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,430
- Senior, that's— 
 - Let's talk later.

165
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,430
   

166
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,290
Noh Myeong Nam is innocent.

167
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,060
He didn't kill Jeon Doo Hyeon or Shin Kyeong Cheol.

168
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,860
He's not the culprit.

169
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,450
Hyungnim, one moment, please.

170
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,770
   

171
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,020
I knew he was trash of a man, but Byeon Jong Il was really the worst.

172
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,150
He beat up his wife and his daughter with a golf club.

173
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,440
He was trying to kill them.

174
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,210
Trash that can't even be recycled.

175
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,840
I didn't see any news articles. Did you stop them?

176
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,770
I stopped them for now...

177
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,470
but the problem is Noh Myeong Nam.

178
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,160
You know who he is. Right?

179
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,830
Continue.

180
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,720
Lake Sopyeong from 27 years ago.

181
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,100
He threatened Byeon Jong Il to confess...

182
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,440
fabricating that incident and framing him as the culprit.

183
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,990
And the detectives got to hear the voice recording of him blackmailing.

184
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,820
So what?

185
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,920
Can that prove anything?

186
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,800
If the journalists get a hold of the recording, the incident from 27 years ago will resurface.

187
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,240
You know it, too. Noh Myeong Nam was there that day at the scene.

188
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,780
Because he's the culprit.

189
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,420
Of course, he must've been there.

190
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,140
Hey...

191
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,520
You have to believe it yourself first.

192
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,940
Change your memories. Completely anew.

193
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,610
Also, let trash take care of trash.

194
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,340
- What do you mean? 
 - Let Byeon Jong Il...

195
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,500
take care of Noh Myeong Nam.

196
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,050
Each should do what each one's good at.

197
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,080
You just focus on what you're good at.

198
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,510
- What am I good at? 
 - Dusting people off.

199
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,380
You're good at that.

200
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,000
Look into Yook Dong Joo and tie him to the case.

201
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,510
Hey...

202
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm a prosecutor of Korea.

203
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,150
You're not a prosecutor. You're inspector general.

204
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,310
And you're facing the confirmation hearing to become the attorney general.

205
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,920
So, you should get rid of things that might get in the way in advance.

206
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,020
What if Yook Dong Joo...

207
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,760
exposes the videotape because we provoke him without a plan?

208
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,530
He doesn't have it.

209
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,430
- He doesn't? 
 - Yook Dong Joo is also looking for the tape.

210
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,870
Hold on.

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,920
Then, how did he write the novel?

212
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,540
Not sure.

213
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,760
Do you know something about this?

214
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,560
I'm more imaginative than you are.

215
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,900
Tell me. What is it?

216
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,520
It was a good opportunity. What a waste.

217
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,210
What opportunity?

218
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,970
It would've been better if Noh Myeong Nam...

219
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,930
had just killed Byeon Jong Il instead of threatening him.

220
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,800
Kyeong Cheol is dead and Sang Woo is missing.

221
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,600
If Byeon Jong Il would just be gone, there would be no more witnesses.

222
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,450
Wait.

223
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,820
That's not it.

224
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,600
You and Hye Kyeong are left.

225
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,130
I'm here, too.

226
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,220
 You guys know, right? 

227
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,280
   

228
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680
 The 400 Blows. 

229
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,890
 Directed by Francois Truffaut. Don't you know? 

230
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,420
 Gosh. 

231
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,330
 You've got a friend who's a director, but you're all so uncultured! 

232
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,450
 There's a certain boy who's as terrible as you guys. 

233
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,990
 But he never listens to his parents and gets beatings for that. 

234
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,820
 One day, he gets taken to juvie because he stole his dad's typewriter. 

235
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,670
 He gets beat up again there. 

236
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,220
 Gosh! 

237
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,290
 He runs away because he wants no more beating. 

238
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,180
 He escapes through a hole in the wall and runs. 

239
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,950
 He just looks ahead and runs. He just keeps running! 

240
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,460
 But... 

241
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,940
 do you know where he ended up eventually? 

242
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,640
 Hey, do something about him. 

243
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,230
 - Should I kill him? 
 - Why not? 

244
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,260
 He runs away like a dog, only to end up at the beach, the sea. 

245
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,840
 A large, boundless sea. 

246
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,120
 He has nowhere to go now. 

247
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,890
 So he turns around and stares at the camera. 

248
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,430
 And cut! 

249
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:20,720
 It pauses, and that bastard's face is zoomed in at the ending scene. 

250
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,300
 It's the best, really! 

251
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,340
 But this Truffaut guy's autobiographical story. 

252
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,410
 He won the grand prix at the Cannes Film Festival with this. 

253
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,970
 Gosh, I didn't recognize this innuendo and missed it. 

254
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,120
 That's why I thought, "Let's talk about an autobiographical story." 

255
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,240
 The 400 Blows. 

256
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,880
 This world beats up and abandons the French bastard for rebelling against it. 

257
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,950
 Right? Empathy? There's none. He's got nowhere to go. All he has left... 

258
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,430
 is a large, boundless sea. 

259
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,240
 But me? 

260
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,400
 Even if I beat people up... 

261
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,660
 the world doesn't know. 

262
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,460
 Even if I beat someone up to death, they don't know. 

263
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,230
 No... 

264
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,860
 they pretend not to know, even if they do. 

265
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,980
 Hey... 

266
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,940
 Can we be freed from that happening? 

267
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,860
 We can't. 

268
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,620
 Never can. 

269
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,110
 So should we live with it shackled on us until we die? 

270
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,980
 Huh? 

271
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,190
 We won't. We will never because I'm the artist! 

272
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,130
 I must sublimate this ironic world. Into what? A movie. 

273
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,810
 Get yourself together! 

274
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,040
 I got myself totally together, you idiot! 

275
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,440
 I already wrote the scenario, too. 

276
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,060
 Since I was writing my own experience, I didn't even get writer's block. 

277
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,710
 My hand couldn't catch up to my brain. 

278
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,520
 Hey, the punk that used to like you. 

279
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,730
 It's Lee Ha Neul. Right? 

280
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,750
 That bastard is the support role. 

281
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,560
 Great, right? 

282
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,710
 Crazy asshole. 

283
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,280
   

284
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,570
 - Quit the nonsense, and let's go. 
 - Hey... 

285
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,140
 let's have your company sponsor the productions. 

286
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,070
 Come on, Tae Man. 

287
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,060
 Of course, you have to cover the production costs. 

288
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,270
 Right? You're the main character. 

289
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,330
 You asshole! 

290
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,180
 Run your mouth one more time, and I will kill you. 

291
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,300
It's free to use money, so rest assured and use it.

292
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,890
Okay.

293
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,140
Thank you.

294
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,850
I heard... there was a suspicious guy at Yook Dong Joo's signing event.

295
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,340
Go and check the CCTV near the event in person.

296
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,640
Who are we looking for?

297
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,570
A familiar face?

298
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,950
Why would you risk going after them? What if they do something to you?

299
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,900
But nothing happened!

300
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,920
How did they know my passcode, though? How skillful.

301
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,610
Hurry up and move to the apartments.

302
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,410
- Do thieves never go for apartments? 
 - At lest they have CCTVs.

303
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,200
That's true.

304
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,330
Did you look for what I asked for? The videotape.

305
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,360
I told you it's not there.

306
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,350
Where are Dad's mementos? You said you stored them elsewhere. Right?

307
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,920
There's nothing fancy enough to be called mementos. They're just music tapes and such.

308
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,670
- Say, "Ah." 
 - Where are they—

309
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,460
Right.

310
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,820
There was someone who was looking for the videotape.

311
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,350
A detective?

312
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,340
No, a pastor.

313
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,080
A p-pastor?

314
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,510
 I was really devoted to that church for a while after your dad passed away because I felt so empty. 

315
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,410
- The cult? 
 - It's a church.

316
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,920
Church, my foot. You gave them all the money from selling the bookstore.

317
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,920
- Who said that? 
 - You told me so.

318
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,780
It wasn't all the money. Just a portion.

319
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,270
Anyhow, that pastor was looking for the videotape?

320
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,170
Yes.

321
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,500
What did he say when asking for it?

322
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,820
I could hardly remember.

323
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,220
But I think he said your dad filmed the orphanage kids and was looking for it.

324
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,710
O-Orphanage?

325
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,860
The church also ran an orphanage, you know.

326
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,800
Thinking about it, your novel's main character was also at an orphanage.

327
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,920
Did you remember all that from your childhood and wrote about it?

328
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,720
How did Dad get into the car accident?

329
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,640
It's nothing good. Why do you keep asking?

330
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,680
Was it a hit-and-run, by chance?

331
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,470
He made me so many toys himself.

332
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,930
 I have no idea why he went there. 

333
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,420
 It wasn't even the way home nor his usual route. 

334
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,980
 - Are you talking about the place he got hit? 
 - It's a remote spot. 

335
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,380
 So even the neighborhood people don't go there at night. 

336
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,250
 But why did Dad go there at night? 

337
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,720
 What about the driver? D-Did you get him? 

338
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,920
 He's probably in hell by now. Condemned by the heavens. 

339
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,900
 The bag you lost... 

340
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,630
 Your father's the one who gave it to me. 

341
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,450
 But I think that's the day I got hit by your car. 

342
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,300
What happened...

343
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,100
that night, Dad?

344
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,580
You planned to get your revenge by using Byeon Ha Young from the beginning. Right?

345
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,110
About two years ago, I realized someone was keeping a watch on our home.

346
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,220
- Was it Noh Myeong Nam? 
 - Yes.

347
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,370
 And when two or three months passed... 

348
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,710
There was this one weekend where

349
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:29,020
this dad of mine came home drunk in broad daylight and started beating my mom and me.

350
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,370
Are you saying you got assaulted by Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il?

351
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,260
- Police Chief! 
 - Hey.

352
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,840
Don't worry about me, and continue.

353
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,310
Yes.

354
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,550
It happened every time he got drunk.

355
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,700
That day, it felt like I'd die if I stayed, so I barely escaped from home.

356
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,530
But I couldn't walk.

357
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,860
   

358
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,550
 Are you okay? 

359
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,530
 Can you stand? 

360
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,230
 Let's get you to the hospital. 

361
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,060
Two months after you got out of prison...

362
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,390
Jeon Doo Hyeon was killed, coincidentally.

363
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,200
You know who Jeon Doo Hyeon is. Right?

364
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,470
Get me Detective Park.

365
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,040
What's wrong?

366
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,100
Whenever times got rough...

367
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,230
I went to Mister.

368
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,630
He was the only person I was able to depend on.

369
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,620
And that's how I found out what he went through.

370
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,310
Noh Myeong Nam! Noh Myeong Nam!

371
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,410
Hey, what are you doing? Call the ambulance.

372
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,900
- Yes. 
 - Can you hear me?

373
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,860
 It's not an error in your memories. It's an error in time. 

374
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,560
 Coincidences don't exist in this world! Things bound to happen end up happening. 

375
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,810
 Say it so it makes sense to me. 

376
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,950
 Back to the future. Hey, hang tight! 

377
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,730
He knew.

378
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,820
He knew all along.

379
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,160
But why...

380
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,790
♫  Blood flows down without guilt  ♫

381
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,000
♫  From the beginning, you are a liar  ♫

382
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,900
♫  Cause you said with emotionless eyes  ♫

383
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,300
♫  Sooty wound  ♫

384
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,080
♫  Get out of this swirling place  ♫

385
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,580
What's he doing there?

386
00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:00,790
♫  Look at the real you in your frozen smile  ♫

387
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:05,260
Hey, Lee Gi Jeok! What are you doing here?

388
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,760
You left this morning and were here all this time?

389
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,920
Did you eat? You don't even have money.

390
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,750
Hey!

391
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,320
Tell me! You knew everything, didn't you?

392
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,480
Tell me the truth!

393
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,050
What did you do?

394
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,390
- Are you insane? 
 - Tell me!

395
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,830
What's wrong with you? What's your problem?

396
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,960
- As if you don't know! 
 - Answer me!

397
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,130
Why are you acting like you've gone insane?

398
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,140
Please tell me.

399
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,050
Why am I here?

400
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,910
Why am I in the year 2022?

401
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,690
Did I...

402
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,420
really come from the past?

403
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,230
Get in the car.

404
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,160
I'll tell you everything I know.

405
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,710
I want to go back.

406
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,160
Do you know how?

407
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,900
- What are you thinking right now? 
 - The same way...

408
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,080
I got here.

409
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,500
Hey, Lee Gi Jeok.

410
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,680
Kang San!

411
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,950
Noh Myeong Nam.

412
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,040
Noh Myeong Nam!

413
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,980
Are you okay?

414
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,660
- What are you doing? 
 - Ow, my back!

415
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,850
Huh?

416
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,200
What the?

417
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,160
What just happened?

418
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,000
W-What are we doing here?

419
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,410
W-What do you call it?

420
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,310
T-Teleportation! Did you just teleport?

421
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,980
I don't know, either.

422
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,020
Ow, ow!

423
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,530
- It's not a dream. 
 - Why pinch me instead of your own face?

424
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,780
You're fine with dying, but care about your cheek? How could you run onto the road like that?

425
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,300
- What if you had really died, you punk? 
 - What about you?

426
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,270
- Do you have a death wish? 
 - Death wish?

427
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,130
You've lost all your manners.

428
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,830
I was born before you were. I'm the older one!

429
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,260
Age is the number of years you've lived, punk. You skipped right through 27 years, so you're still a young adult!

430
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,770
Why did you hide that from me if you knew?

431
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,850
Why didn't you tell me anything when you knew everything?

432
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,040
- Wait, my car! 
 - Don't change the topic.

433
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,440
I left something important in it. And the engine is running.

434
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,230
What time is it? Where's my phone?

435
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,600
I have something important to attend to, so I have to leave.

436
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,110
Let's talk about this after I'm back.

437
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,100
There's something more important than me being from 27 years ago?

438
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,020
There is.

439
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:35,410
On the last day you saw my father, you said a policeman came looking for him at the bookstore. Right?

440
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,540
Yes.

441
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,710
 Mister is a detective. 

442
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,850
 You've seen me before. Right? 

443
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,770
 It's a secret you saw me. Okay? 

444
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,090
 Why? 

445
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,480
 It's a secret operation. 

446
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,560
 You mustn't tell secrets. Even to your mom. 

447
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,230
It's him.

448
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,100
Who is?

449
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,270
If you were going to slip through time, you should've gone to the past!

450
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,870
Then you would've prevented misfortune or changed destiny or something!

451
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,820
Why come 27 years later...

452
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,760
Forget it!

453
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,960
Your name...

454
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,260
is Lee Kang San.

455
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,210
I know.

456
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,610
Let's talk after I get back.

457
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,660
Gosh, my shoes. 
  (Shoes sounds very close to the word "fuck." Intended to sound like a curse.) 

458
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,840
 Kang San! 

459
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,950
He's so reckless. What if he had really died?

460
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,560
 The person in the photo isn't you. 

461
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,070
 I'm really worried since you left like that earlier. 

462
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,910
 I want to know if you got home safely. 

463
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,060
 I'm also worried if you're okay. 

464
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,720
   

465
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,050
Geez, this bastard isn't picking up his phone again.

466
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:48,190
Gosh, I ought to cut ties with this bastard. He lacks basic etiquette.

467
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,410
How's this?

468
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,240
Whoa! That rocks.

469
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,850
Chairman Lee told me to prepare this.

470
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:02,770
- Sorry? 
 - He must want to specially treat Writer Yook Dong Joo.

471
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,690
He doesn't need to go that far.

472
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,000
I once met him when he was a kid.

473
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,780
Met who?

474
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,520
Writer Yook Dong Joo.

475
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,530
- Dong Joo? 
 - Yes.

476
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:23,010
Writer Yook Dong Joo's father ran a bookstore near our school.

477
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,170
I've seen him there.

478
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,730
It was just once, though.

479
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,170
Are you talking about Taekang High School?

480
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,310
Yeah.

481
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:38,080
I'd forgotten about him, but I remembered once I saw his name.

482
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,890
It was called Dong Joo Bookstore.

483
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,420
The surname, Yook, isn't common, either.

484
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,790
That's interesting.

485
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,600
Indeed.

486
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,870
Yes, this is Lee Myeong Seok. Go ahead.

487
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,060
We already talked this through with Director Shin's wife.

488
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,560
You can't do that when all that's left is to sign the contract.

489
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,930
It's not like I wasn't acquainted with Director Shin.

490
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:15,100
   

491
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,570
 Happy birthday! 

492
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,560
 Of course, it's your birthday gift. 

493
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,020
 Your brother ran into a slight problem. 

494
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,860
 Kang San, 

495
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,370
 listen carefully to what I say. 

496
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,340
 From now on, 

497
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,410
 you can't trust anyone. 

498
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,450
   

499
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,780
I told you not to jump to conclusions.

500
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,530
I told you to find evidence before cracking down on him!

501
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,190
I followed the procedure, and I didn't even crack down on him.

502
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,960
- Then why did he have a seizure? 
 - They said it was due to his panic attack!

503
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,230
If you don't believe me, run through the recording.

504
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,220
You knew he had a panic disorder!

505
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,390
You should've taken that into consideration while interrogating him!

506
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,820
I just did as usual. He's fine now, too. He must've been faking it.

507
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,540
Why won't he go to the hospital?

508
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,690
I wouldn't know.

509
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,820
And Noh Myeong Nam is the culprit.

510
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,990
- There you go again! 
 - He can't provide an alibi.

511
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,090
If he's innocent, he can just provide an alibi, and this would all be over. Why can't he reveal it?

512
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,390
Geez. Damn it.

513
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:48,820
I'm telling you that he's the culprit.

514
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,630
He doesn't have anything to say, so he keeps asking needlessly if we checked the CCTV.

515
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,580
What CCTV?

516
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,960
He asked if we checked the CCTV in front of Byeon Jong Il's house two years ago.

517
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,220
As if he's the detective.

518
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,700
Did you check it?

519
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,360
I didn't know it was related to the Sopyeong Lake case at the time.

520
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,230
- I just looked into the loan sharks. 
 - The last person he called was Byeon Jong Il.

521
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,900
I checked everything.

522
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,370
Byeon Jong Il's alibi was solid. You saw the case records.

523
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,560
Noh Myeong Nam wouldn't tell you why he wants you to check the CCTV?

524
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,670
He won't.

525
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,670
Switch with Detective Park.

526
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,580
- Team Leader Oh... 
 - There must be a reason he keeps asking for Detective Park!

527
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,490
That's because he thinks Detective Park is a pushover!

528
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,210
Do you think I'm a pushover? Why do you keep talking back?

529
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,290
Are you going through menopause?

530
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,400
What? Hey, you little—

531
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,390
Gosh, that little...

532
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,900
Go grab a cup of coffee.

533
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,000
That's all right.

534
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,980
I'll keep watch, so at least wash your face. So you can wake up.

535
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,780
I'll make it quick, then.

536
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,300
Goodness... You have it tough.

537
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:56,830
You should go to the hospital. Why are you being stubborn?

538
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,510
It would be nice to sleep overnight at the hospital.

539
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:08,150
There's nothing you want to say to Byeon Ha Young? I'll deliver the message.

540
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:15,930
Byeon Ha Young... is really worried about you.

541
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,060
It's frustrating, isn't it?

542
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:28,670
Honestly, I know... you're being wrongly accused.

543
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:33,740
Years of working in this field gave me the ability to discern people who are wronged.

544
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,950
Which is why you probably developed a panic disorder.

545
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,080
You look exhausted. Do you want to get some air?

546
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,510
Here.

547
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:50,350
- I quit. 
 - Whoa, so tenacious.

548
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,600
I ought to quit, too.

549
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,790
The novel Yook Dong Joo wrote...

550
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,400
Why did you send it to Detective Park?

551
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,100
There are other detectives.

552
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,940
Why Detective Park, of all people?

553
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,950
There must be a reason. Right?

554
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,700
You asked for Detective Park all this time, too.

555
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,880
You can tell me everything.

556
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,560
Where did Noh Myeong Nam go?

557
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,780
I'll help you.

558
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,720
What are you trying to tell Detective Park?

559
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:49,630
Let's go inside. It's cold.

560
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,040
By any chance,

561
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,760
did you meet Detective Han Min Woo two years ago?

562
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,560
So you did.

563
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,430
Let's go inside.

564
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,360
I said I'll help you.

565
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,260
You'll get framed again. Do you want to go back to prison?

566
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,250
I didn't kill him.

567
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,290
So just tell me everything.

568
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,480
What did you tell Detective Han Min Woo?

569
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,440
You kept mentioning a CCTV earlier. Does it have to do with that?

570
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,340
Detective Han Min Woo and I... were colleagues.

571
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,770
He was my best friend.

572
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,880
Please trust me.

573
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,160
Trust me and... tell me if you're hiding anything.

574
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,060
Tell me what you were going to tell Detective Park.

575
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,820
What are you doing right now?

576
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,450
I asked, what you're doing here?

577
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,570
What do you think? We're getting some fresh air.

578
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,230
I escorted him outside because I thought he needed some air.

579
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,670
Don't you feel better after getting some air?

580
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,370
Let's go down.

581
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,510
Are you really okay not to go to the hospital?

582
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,720
Yes, I'm okay.

583
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,330
Providing a statement is still too much for him. Team Leader Oh also said to do that tomorrow.

584
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,640
"Fortuna..."

585
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,930
The goddess of fortune.

586
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,730
Let's see what fortune awaits me.

587
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:05,840
Oh, my gosh!

588
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,890
- Seriously, what's with you— 
 - Oh, sorry.

589
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,340
Oh? Your nose!

590
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,580
My nose?

591
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,450
- B-Blood... 
 - Blood?

592
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:23,250
- A nosebleed. 
 - You!

593
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,540
Seriously!

594
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,580
- Seriously... 
 - I-It wasn't intentional.

595
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,230
I warned you not to be late.

596
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,580
Something came up.

597
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,530
Then you should've at least called!

598
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:42,660
- Why didn't you pick up? 
 - We should get inside. Stop talking. Chairman Lee is waiting.

599
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,940
- Chairman Lee is waiting inside. 
 - See?

600
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,450
I parked my car there because I was in a hurry. Is that okay?

601
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,360
If you give me the keys, I'll move it for you.

602
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,910
Okay.

603
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,500
- Thank you. 
 - Hey, hurry up!

604
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,230
I'm coming!

605
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,000
Geez.

606
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,660
Welcome.

607
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,450
Over here. This is CEO Kang.

608
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,040
Nice to meet you.

609
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,060
Likewise.

610
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,510
Please come this way.

611
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,310
   

612
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,450
I'm sorry.

613
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:05,420
I ran a bit late because something suddenly came up.

614
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,350
It's more than just a bit late.

615
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,330
Have a seat.

616
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,780
I really like the title of your book.

617
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,770
"God Has Died." I also agree.

618
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,190
Capitalism became a religion, and capital became a god.

619
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,000
Please drop the honorifics.

620
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,820
He's my college classmate.

621
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,820
What?

622
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,290
   

623
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,100
Is that okay with you?

624
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,940
Yes, that's all right.

625
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,190
   

626
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,920
Wow, this is nice.

627
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,920
Do you... know how much one glass costs?

628
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,570
900,000 won.

629
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:28,300
Chairman Lee especially prepared this for you.

630
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,490
Well, it's nothing special. I drink it all the time.

631
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:41,330
It's not "God Has Died," it's "God Is Dead."

632
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,740
The title of the novel.

633
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,780
At any rate, aren't you trying to say that god doesn't exist?

634
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:55,320
It's a form of irony.

635
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,420
Since he who claims god is dead...

636
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,870
is a man who desperately wants god to be alive.

637
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,380
Hey, what's with you? Are you here to lecture?

638
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,640
No, it's entertaining.

639
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,960
And he reminds me of my old friend.

640
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,820
I had a friend who wrote very well.

641
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:20,050
Reading your novel reminded me of him.

642
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,690
Your writing styles are also somewhat similar.

643
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:31,090
If he had written a novel, I imagine he'd have written like you.

644
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,150
You must have a lot of interest in literature.

645
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,090
Not at all.

646
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,740
The last novel I read was "The Old Man and the Sea" in high school.

647
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,410
Oh, that's a classic!

648
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:51,280
That's what everyone says, but I felt it was frustrating.

649
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,220
- And the old man was pathetic. 
 - What do you mean, pathetic?

650
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,850
When it comes to fighting fiercely, one has to know his opponent.

651
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:05,600
A weak old man taking on a group of sharks is foolish.

652
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:11,480
It's an obvious ending where his fish will be torn apart anyway, and he'll return barely alive.

653
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,090
He should use his head.

654
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:18,500
If it were me, I would've made a deal with the shark.

655
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,650
You can call it a compromise.

656
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,330
Wow, how?

657
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:28,660
I'd cut out the parts of the fish I need and load them on my boat, and throw the rest to the sharks as feed.

658
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,780
Then the old man would be moderately full and the sharks would also be satisfied.

659
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,650
A happy ending.

660
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,960
The old man was left with the bones of the marlin.

661
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,430
Bones?

662
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:50,050
People could tell the truth about that night just by looking at the huge bones.

663
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:56,440
The size of the blue marlin, how cruel and persistent the shark attack was,

664
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:00,690
and how fiercely the old man fought without giving in.

665
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,280
Those bones are what prove it all.

666
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,280
You can say it was proof the old man was not defeated.

667
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,160
This guy is naive. Right?

668
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,590
He views the world too innocently.

669
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,660
People are really weird.

670
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,490
They always do things they're told not to.

671
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,260
They try to open doors they're told not to open.

672
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,740
And they turn around when they're told not to.

673
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:42,600
Which is why, in the end, they meet a sad ending. Right?

674
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,430
   

675
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,090
I called, but you didn't pick up.

676
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,700
I left my phone,

677
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,650
so I came back.

678
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,720
Thank God.

679
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,930
Well...

680
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:04,130
I know this might sound weird, but what I said earlier is the truth.

681
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:10,170
I got into a car accident, and when I came to, I was in the year 2022.

682
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:15,140
I had lost all my memories at the time, so I didn't realize where I was.

683
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:22,020
Let's go inside. Let's go in and talk.

684
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,910
Have you heard anything...

685
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,680
about my brother Ha Neul?

686
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,370
You haven't heard anything... about my brother?

687
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:46,350
Before I came here, Brother went missing.

688
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,410
My brother never returned after that?

689
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:56,640
I need to find my brother. Twenty-seven years passed by without me knowing.

690
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:00,290
Brother must've looked for me all this time, too.

691
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,070
He might think I'm dead.

692
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,330
Are you...

693
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,630
really Kang San?

694
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,800
You're really...

695
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,430
Lee Kang San?

696
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,320
I am.

697
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,660
I'm sorry I couldn't...

698
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,090
keep my promise to you to take a photo...

699
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:45,700
at the end of the millennium.

700
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:08,170
 When it becomes the year 2000, let's take a photo here to commemorate the millennium. 

701
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:11,440
 The apocalypse won't happen until then. Right? 

702
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:24,630
♫  Even if I try to make up my mind  ♫

703
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:34,310
♫  I guess I can't help it, I miss your face  ♫

704
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:39,160
♫  Come back to me this once  ♫

705
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,920
♫  I'm afraid of being forgotten  ♫

706
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,990
♫  Us growing apart, our failed love  ♫

707
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:53,850
♫  This moment seems like a dream  ♫

708
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:58,660
♫  Not being able to see you again  ♫

709
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,320
   

710
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,230
 Are any of these people the students you witnessed at Sopyeong Lake 27 years ago? 

711
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,500
 I need to find my brother first. 

712
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,780
 There's no one reported missing under that name. 

713
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:12,600
 I can't let him find out Lee Ha Neul is committing murders. 

714
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,030
 I need to tell you something face to face. It's really important. 

715
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,760
 How did you end up with the bag? 

716
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,680
 Kang San brought it here. 

717
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,690
 Everything that happened to your brother 27 years ago is in that book. 

718
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,040
 It's a student I.D. 

719
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,240
 Are you certain I'm Lee Ha Neul? 

720
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,080
 What's that supposed to mean? 

721
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,400
 Ha Neul's body was discovered in Sopyeong Lake. 

722
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,660
 - My son is here. 
- Yes, Father. 

723
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,830
 Tell me the truth. Did you really write, "God Is Dead"? 

724
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,660
♫  Don't forget about us  ♫
