2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,990
Brother!

3
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,920
Kang San...

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,210
Brother!

5
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,910
Brother!

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,960
I missed you, Brother.

7
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,360
By the way, how did you know I was here?

8
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,260
Mr. Noh Myeong Nam told me.

9
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,940
What do you mean?

10
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,840
   

11
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,180
It doesn't look like it got wet.

12
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,130
It couldn't have been damaged, could it?

13
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,630
    
 Let's check it first.

14
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,130
Do we need to go to Cheonggyecheon?

15
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,060
There's an old camcorder at my house.

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,400
Really?

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,210
 But I don't know if the adapter's there, too. 

18
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,690
 We just need to get one if there isn't. 

19
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,670
Your father's really smart.

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,980
How did he think of creating a secret drawer in here?

21
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
What's this?

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,950
It looks like a letter.

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,360
 You finally found it, huh? 

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,080
 I hope you'll find this letter much later. 

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,670
 It's a letter I hid intentionally to give my son the strength to move on during hard times. 

26
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,460
 Dong Joo, did you know this? 

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,950
 From the moment you were born and to this moment, 

28
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:27,010
 your mom and dad are having the happiest days of our lives. 

29
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,780
 I'm so thankful for all the precious times spent with you. 

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,730
 Rather than becoming rich or having a successful career, 

31
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,870
 I hope you will become someone who loves the weak and helpless with all your heart, 

32
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,530
 feel the joy in each day diligently, and spread happiness. 

33
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,360
 It might sound difficult at the moment, 

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,420
 but you'll understand when you become an adult. 

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,290
 And you have to be good to your mom. 

36
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:09,560
 Don't forget the person who loves and cherishes you the most is your mom. 

37
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,800
 Dong Joo, don't get sick and be healthy. 

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,630
 Be together for a long, long time with your mom and me. 

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,480
 I love you. From Dad. 

40
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,890
They say things fall into your lap.

41
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,930
This is it.

42
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,140
You're doing great, Yook Dong Joo.

43
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,010
It's not like I can see or hear things from everyone.

44
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,130
I especially don't see or hear anything from people I used to be close to.

45
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,750
Dong Joo is the same.

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,170
And you, too, Brother.

47
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,550
So many crazy things have happened.

48
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,260
I-I can tell.

49
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,660
Let's go inside.

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,370
You're still the same, Brother.

51
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,960
Does Dong Joo also know you came here?

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,680
I didn't have time to tell him.

53
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,850
Don't tell him.

54
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,260
You can trust Dong Joo.

55
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,900
It's not because I don't trust him.

56
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,360
Also... you should never come back here, either.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
Brother?

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,940
It's dangerous for you to come.

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,170
You can't ever come back.

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
- I don't want to. 
 - Kang San.

61
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm going to be with you.

62
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,840
I'll never get separated again.

63
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,440
If it's dangerous here, we can go somewhere else and live together.

64
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,940
I have my own life.

65
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,270
And you have yours.

66
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,250
How can you think of them separately?

67
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,440
Your life is my life.

68
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,490
- They're one. 
 - Don't be childish.

69
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,840
I can help you.

70
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,050
I told you. I have a special power.

71
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,870
I know what you're trying to do. I'll help you.

72
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,460
If you want to help me, don't ever come back here.

73
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,550
- No. 
 - Listen to me.

74
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,560
You got Byeon Jong Il's confession, too.

75
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,240
Dong Joo is looking for the videotape, too.

76
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,530
We can help you. I can help you, Brother!

77
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,310
You can't help with anything!

78
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,830
The Lee Ha Neul you know exists no more.

79
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,390
Because I abandoned the name, Lee Ha Neul, 27 years ago.

80
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,640
You're the same then and now.

81
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,410
You're the same person.

82
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,100
Kang San, you're special.

83
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,900
You came here like a miracle and have an unbelievably special ability.

84
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,950
Not everyone is given such a thing.

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,880
If it's for my good and if you want to help me,

86
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,530
I want you to live your life diligently and happily,

87
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,460
instead of wasting your life.

88
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,630
You're the one who's wasting your life.

89
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,860
How can I live happily when you're miserable?

90
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,660
How can I live my life when you're in pain and suffering?

91
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,750
To meet you and to be with you,

92
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,240
I came here, jumping through 27 years.

93
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,910
Regardless of whose name you've been living as, nothing has changed for me.

94
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,290
You're Lee Ha Neul, and you're my brother.

95
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,880
I know what you're concerned about.

96
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,890
I know coming here is dangerous, too.

97
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,330
Regardless of the things you did and the things you do in the future,

98
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,210
I understand everything.

99
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,300
I would've done the same.

100
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,180
Actually, I would've never let someone like Byeon Jong Il live.

101
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,500
I would've killed him.

102
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,110
But you let him go.

103
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,990
You want to expose the truth. Right?

104
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,880
As you said, I'll be careful about coming here from now on.

105
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,020
I won't ever tell anyone about this place.

106
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,850
Instead, you promise me one thing, too.

107
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:05,180
Promise me... you won't ever disappear.

108
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:13,410
No matter what happens, promise me you'll stay in touch with me.

109
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,580
♫  You're a liar from the beginning  ♫

110
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,940
Brother.

111
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,990
♫  With emotionless eyes  ♫

112
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,730
Okay.

113
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,570
You mean it. Right?

114
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,360
Yes.

115
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,090
I promise you.

116
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:47,930
♫  Look at the real you in your frozen smile  ♫

117
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,190
 Jeon Doo Hyeon was already 

118
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,410
 dead inside Byeon Jong Il's home. 

119
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,760
 I don't know the exact circumstances of his death. 

120
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,380
But he seemed to have been strangled to death.

121
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,590
Is Byeon Jong Il the one who killed Jeon Doo Hyeon?

122
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,540
- Yes. 
 - What's the proof?

123
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,760
When Cheetah entered Byeon Jong Il's house,

124
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,070
he said he only saw Byeon Jong Il and the dead Jeon Doo Hyeon.

125
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:29,980
And Byeon Jong Il had ordered to disguise Jeon Doo Hyeon's corpse as suicide.

126
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,200
What about the attempted murder of Noh Myeong Nam?

127
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,250
Byeon Jong Il probably ordered Cheetah to murder Noh Myeong Nam.

128
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,440
Since Detective Kim confessed to everything, don't waste your effort and spill it.

129
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,400
If you keep quiet like this, you'll take the fall for Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder.

130
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,030
Byeon Jong Il said Jeon Doo Hyeon got drunk and called someone he knows, and left his home alive.

131
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,660
And feigned ignorance on ordering Noh Myeong Nam's murder.

132
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,470
Byeon Jong Il has no interest in protecting you.

133
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,000
Rather, he can't do it anymore, even if he wants to.

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,670
Byeon Jong Il will be locked up sooner or later.

135
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,750
With murder and attempted murder, do you want to spend the rest of your life in prison?

136
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,890
I'll give you time to make up your mind, so think carefully.

137
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,200
Okay?

138
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,340
Detective.

139
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,230
Could I have a cigarette, please?

140
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,760
Good job.

141
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,340
I have something to ask Detective Kim. It'll take only a moment. Please, I ask you.

142
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,270
There's something I want to ask you.

143
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,340
There was a two-hour gap until Senior Han Min Woo got home after receiving CCTV footage

144
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,130
of the outside of Byeon Jong Il's home from the public office worker.

145
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,430
Did he meet you in those two hours?

146
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,280
Min Woo had called me.

147
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,100
 Han Min Woo! 

148
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,660
 Why did you come after taking your day off for your son's birthday? 

149
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,200
 Is something wrong? 

150
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,610
 I found the CCTV footage from in front of Byeon Jong Il's home. 

151
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,540
 The public office worker said a detective took the footage. 

152
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,000
 So, I looked at the CCTV footage of the government building that day. 

153
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,800
 Hey, what are you saying? 

154
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,500
 You should've gotten rid of that, too, if you were going to. 

155
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,370
 The footage has you going in and out of the government building. 

156
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,120
 - Min Woo— 
 - Hyeok Jin. 

157
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,300
 Although it might feel like you'll lose everything by confessing the truth, 

158
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,320
 you can still keep your pride. 

159
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,750
 Also, people remain. 

160
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,900
 Your seniors, juniors, colleagues, and me... 

161
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,330
 We'll remain by your side. 

162
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,080
 Getting fired doesn't mean your life is over. 

163
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,980
 You're good at many things. 

164
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,450
 You're an amazing cook. 

165
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,360
 You'll be successful with a restaurant business. 

166
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,900
 Hyeok Jin. 

167
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,170
 Just let it all go... and start fresh again. 

168
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,050
 I'll help you. 

169
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,990
 Okay? 

170
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,230
 Give me just... 

171
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,680
 one day to decide. 

172
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,150
I was planning to turn myself in.

173
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,770
But after hearing Min Woo died from an accident that night...

174
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,780
I-I'm sorry.

175
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,090
I found the videotape.

176
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,080
Really? Where did you find it?

177
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,930
It was at my grandma's house.

178
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,290
She was using it as a planting pot.

179
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,530
- A planting pot? 
 - Yes.

180
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,570
I'm checking the footage right now. Can you come over?

181
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,710
I can't come right now.

182
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,800
- I think I can come around the evening time. 
 - Okay.

183
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,730
And also, if the video has the crime scene,

184
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,890
- Noh Myeong Nam can appeal for retrial. Right? 
 - He can.

185
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,230
Also, we can reinvestigate.

186
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,900
But the statute of limitations passed.

187
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,750
Even if the statute of limitations passed, we can reinvestigate when there's new evidence.

188
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,790
Though we can't try them at the court, we have to uncover the truth.

189
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,110
So, of course, we have to reinvestigate.

190
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,220
   

191
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,360
We can at least have Byeon Jong Il tried in court.

192
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,360
He got out of the confession footage, saying it was a false confession.

193
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,870
But once the Lake Sopyeong video gets exposed, Byeon Jong Il's confession will turn out to be true.

194
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,080
If we have Byeon Jong Il stand in court, he'll open up about Lee Tae Man.

195
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,440
He won't go down alone.

196
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,000
In that case, we'll find other crimes by Lee Tae Man.

197
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,620
The situation is becoming favorable for us.

198
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,730
I'll tell you the details in person.

199
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,450
- Who were you talking to? 
 - It's Writer Yook Dong Joo.

200
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,630
He found the videotape with the crime scene of the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago.

201
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,300
- Really? 
 - Yes.

202
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,970
Nice!

203
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,340
The video is in perfect condition.

204
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,850
 Move, move, move! 

205
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,900
 Die! 

206
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,980
Those brats are totally drunk.

207
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,030
- Or is it drugs? 
 - It's both.

208
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,440
Crazy fuckers.

209
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,160
And they brag, calling themselves the elites.

210
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,670
Whoa, it's making my guts churn.

211
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,790
The one recording is Shin Kyeong Cheol.

212
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,130
- What about Lee Tae Man? 
 - He'll come out sooner or later since

213
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,380
he killed the homeless man.

214
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,330
 So Lee Tae Man's the main suspect. 

215
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,670
 He's a murderer. 

216
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,980
 Hurry it up! 

217
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,570
 Kill him! 

218
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,720
 Hey, move out! 

219
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,020
 Kill him! Kill him! 

220
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,050
 Kick him! Kick him! 

221
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,380
So you're saying, after he was announced dead from a car accident,

222
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,680
he woke up miraculously but fell into a brain-dead state again.

223
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,610
And he came back again to life two months later?

224
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,290
Yes, Chairman Lee.

225
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,740
Hallelujah!

226
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,650
And then?

227
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,300
What was his second miracle after the resurrection?

228
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,080
It's rather an absurd story.

229
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,320
Miracles are supposed to be absurd. Go on and tell me.

230
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,390
A while back, Yook Dong Joo had reported a mother for child abuse and was arrested.

231
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,250
- So what? 
 - I showed that woman this student's picture, and she said something weird.

232
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,800
What was so weird about it?

233
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,940
What are you going to do now?

234
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,730
I need to expose it.

235
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,160
You'll report it to the press?

236
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,510
I need a more certain measure.

237
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,260
A certain measure?

238
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,740
Taekang Group is the press' biggest advertiser.

239
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,120
They also have a major influence over the prosecution.

240
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,190
If I make a report without a plan, Lee Tae Man might interfere even before it gets broadcast.

241
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,780
That's possible.

242
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,100
On top of that, one of the suspects is Inspector General Choi Jong Nam.

243
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,240
Inspector General?

244
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,380
Yes. I only found out recently, too.

245
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,720
This is ridiculous.

246
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,420
A bastard like him is judging other people's sins?

247
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,460
Wow...

248
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,960
Those bastards might claim it wasn't them even if we expose it.

249
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,290
The statute of limitations passed anyway, and they've got the power already.

250
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,610
So they're going to deny it, no matter what.

251
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,550
There's the graduation album and also the graduates who will testify for us.

252
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,900
We have more than enough proof.

253
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,430
They said the detective who turned himself in was spilling everything.

254
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,900
It's only a matter of time until Byeon Jong Il's henchman opens his mouth.

255
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,130
Even if he's an assemblyman, Byeon Jong Il's got no way out now.

256
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,260
Tell him to go abroad for a bit.

257
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,500
I already called him to get him out, but this crazy fucker isn't picking up.

258
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,930
What did his aide say?

259
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,690
He didn't contact Byeon Jong Il today since he said he's taking the day off.

260
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,870
So I told him to go to Assemblyman Byeon right away with the plane tickets.

261
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,530
Did you meet Assemblyman Byeon?

262
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,300
What?

263
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,980
Request an arrest warrant for Byeon Jong Il right now.

264
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,020
All right.

265
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,670
- Did Cheetah confess? 
 - Yes.

266
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,330
He also confessed that Byeon Jong Il ordered the attempted murder of Noh Myeong Nam.

267
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,460
Even if he's the notorious Byeon Jong Il, he can't get out of this anymore.

268
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,700
With the murder of Jeon Doo Hyeon and instigating the murder of Noh Myeong Nam,

269
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,420
he won't come out even after having his 80th birthday party in prison.

270
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,450
Yes, it's Team Leader Oh of Violent Crimes Team 3.

271
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,660
What?

272
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,050
Where?

273
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,780
Okay.

274
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,350
Byeon Jong Il is dead.

275
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,030
Hey, make sure to tell Detective Park!

276
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,490
Once reinvestigation starts, get the arrest warrant and the bench warrant.

277
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,580
Get whatever she can get slapped on him, and with everyone watching,

278
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,740
bring Lee Tae Man and Choi Jong Nam to the station, handcuffed and all!

279
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,780
We need to get those bastards to get the public's outrage, at least.

280
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,840
That's not enough.

281
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,850
True, but it can't be helped since the statute of limitations passed.

282
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,910
Not just Byeon Jong Il, Lee Tae Man also has to...

283
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,650
stand in court and get punished.

284
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,700
How will Lee Tae Man stand in court?

285
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,160
I need to expose everything at once.

286
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,390
There's more to expose?

287
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,720
You'll see later.

288
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,430
I have no idea what it is, but watch out.

289
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,410
These bastards kill people.

290
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,390
No one knows what they'll do to you.

291
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,180
Don't worry.

292
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,520
- It's time for my shift. 
 - Yeah?

293
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,480
Hurry up and go. Thanks for the help.

294
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,240
It's nothing. Call me any time. I'll come right away.

295
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,030
Okay.

296
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,410
By the way, Dong Joo.

297
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:13,130
From what I saw in the footage earlier, the crime scene was just like what you wrote in your novel.

298
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,370
How did you write about it in your novel?

299
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,600
It was so fascinating.

300
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,720
Did you hear about it from someone?

301
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,220
Well...

302
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,530
He was at the scene.

303
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,760
What? You were at the scene?

304
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,430
I didn't write the novel.

305
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,020
The novel was written by...

306
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,600
the student named Lee Ha Neul we saw in the video.

307
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,660
Don't joke with me.

308
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,670
I wish it was a joke.

309
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,700
But it's the truth.

310
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,110
I stole...

311
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,560
the novel Lee Ha Neul wrote.

312
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,710
You...

313
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,630
were fooled by me all this time.

314
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,660
It's late, but I'm going to correct it.

315
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,460
I'm sorry, Yong Dae.

316
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,580
It's okay.

317
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,490
You just need to correct it.

318
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,220
Anyone can do the wrong thing.

319
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,220
But not everyone's brave enough to correct the wrong.

320
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,820
You're amazing.

321
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,720
I'm going.

322
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,460
While you were there, you should've had dinner with Grandma.

323
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,090
Why did you come back so soon?

324
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,430
Grandma was upset about it.

325
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,550
I had an urgent business.

326
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,330
Yes, I found it.

327
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,690
 - That's great.  
 - Yes, it's great.

328
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,460
Hey, Mom.

329
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,920
Do you want to take a trip with Grandma?

330
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,000
Go on a trip out of nowhere?

331
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,890
It's been a while since you've seen Aunt.

332
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,180
Take Grandma and visit Aunt in Canada.

333
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,610
I'm sure Grandma will love it, too.

334
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,080
I'll reserve the plane tickets and sites you can visit in Canada.

335
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,820
How can I go to Canada with all the business here?

336
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,250
You can just take a break.

337
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,540
I'll take my time to think about it.

338
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,930
Don't be like that and go, Mom.

339
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,980
You can leave first thing tomorrow. There are tickets.

340
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,650
It's not like Canada is across the town. How can I go tomorrow?

341
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,570
You can just go. Why not?

342
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,640
- I'll make the reservations for you. 
 - What's the rush?

343
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,980
I'll call and ask your aunt.

344
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,580
Yes, okay.

345
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,750
I'm getting spoiled, thanks to my son.

346
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,490
 I'll call you back after talking to Aunt. 

347
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,800
   

348
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,130
   

349
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,450
- Hey, Yong Dae. 
  - Did you see the news? 

350
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,720
- What news? 
  - Byeon Jong Il is dead. 

351
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,840
W-What?

352
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,310
What's the cause of death?

353
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,050
Looking at the angle of the constriction mark, it looks like he was strangled from behind.

354
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,280
I'm sure the victim must've kicked around.

355
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,030
Did the killer lay down the corpse after killing him?

356
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,050
The wife said she moved the corpse.

357
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,820
- You mean she damaged the scene? 
 - Yes.

358
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,440
There's a trace of the sofa having been pushed.

359
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,240
Looks like it was pushed as he fought back while getting strangled.

360
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,580
Why did you move the corpse?

361
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,920
I couldn't leave it as it was.

362
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,640
It was a murder scene.

363
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,860
It means you've damaged a crime scene.

364
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,040
It wasn't murder. He was struck by the heavens.

365
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,170
Sorry?

366
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,960
Since he paid for his sins with his life,

367
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm sure god has also forgiven him now.

368
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,960
Where were you last night?

369
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,500
I was attending a vigil at the temple.

370
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,810
Are you talking about Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple?

371
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,300
Yes.

372
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,190
Also, we're not doing an autopsy.

373
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,280
A precious body going to God mustn't be cut open by knives.

374
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,690
The autopsy will take place with a search and seizure warrant.

375
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:15,320
- Who says? 
 - When signs of murder allegations are clear, even the bereaved family can't stop an autopsy.

376
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,130
Go inside.

377
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,720
And remember what I told you.

378
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,450
Don't worry.

379
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,320
Keep in touch, Brother.

380
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,880
Okay.

381
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,930
Wait, Kang San.

382
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,170
Call this number if something urgent happens.

383
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,960
It has to be from a public phone.

384
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,810
And this number... Don't save it on your phone, either.

385
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,620
All right.

386
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,510
Be careful. Stay healthy.

387
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,240
You, too.

388
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,800
Get inside.

389
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,510
Make sure to keep in touch.

390
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,400
All right.

391
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,690
 (Go.) 

392
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,270
Is it true Byeon Jong Il is dead?

393
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,800
It's been reported as a suicide. Is that true?

394
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,600
It's not a suicide. I'll tell you the details in person.

395
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,830
What was that call about?

396
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,100
Byeon Jong Il is dead.

397
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,430
She said it wasn't a suicide...

398
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,590
which means it was a homicide.

399
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,890
He's been murdered?

400
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,590
Yeah.

401
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,760
He should've been put on trial.

402
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,790
We were so close.

403
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,750
I'm going nuts.

404
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:36,370
I'll never know how my father passed away.

405
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,440
Then... what happens now?

406
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,320
Since Byeon Jong Il died, it'll end with no right to indict.

407
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,820
Will the Lake Sopyeong case be buried like that, too?

408
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,200
I found the videotape.

409
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,560
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

410
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,910
Where was it?

411
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,460
At my grandmother's house.

412
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,350
Fortunately, the tape wasn't damaged, so it's enough evidence.

413
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,970
Then, we can reveal the truth now?

414
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,250
We can at least reveal what happened 27 years ago at Lake Sopyeong

415
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,050
and who the real culprits are.

416
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,820
That's great news.

417
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,530
Yeah.

418
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:23,890
I am upset Father's case will get buried like this.

419
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:28,730
But there could be another witness, so I'll search until the end.

420
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,440
That's right.

421
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,340
But where are you coming from?

422
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,580
I went to see Mr. Noh Myeong Nam, hoping I'd see something else.

423
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,010
Did you see anything else?

424
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,950
Can I watch the videotape footage?

425
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,140
What?

426
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,250
Honestly, I don't want you to watch it.

427
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,970
Don't worry and show it to me.

428
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,320
There's something I should tell you beforehand.

429
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
What is it?

430
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,340
When the video is revealed, Director Shin Kyeong Cheol's case will become an issue.

431
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:22,310
News claiming Ha Neul is a prime suspect will be inevitable.

432
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,760
There will come a tempest.

433
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,990
So... brace yourself.

434
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,650
I'm going to get changed first.

435
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,610
S-Sure.

436
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,960
Kang San!

437
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,340
 Brother! It's me. 

438
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,560
Kang San, what's wrong?

439
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,470
Dong Joo found the Lake Sopyeong videotape.

440
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,430
- What? 
 - Dong Joo is going to reveal it.

441
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,190
Once it's revealed...

442
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,640
Kang San.

443
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,350
I mean,

444
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,060
I just thought you should be aware.

445
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,520
Sure, all right.

446
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,570
Brother.

447
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,590
Yeah, go ahead.

448
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,620
You were right.

449
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,920
You're not Lee Ha Neul.

450
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,080
Your name is different, too.

451
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,260
You're someone else.

452
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,060
- Kang San— 
 - Don't get caught.

453
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,420
Like you've been doing all this time, stay hidden.

454
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,220
I'll still be able to find you.

455
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,420
You don't need to contact me.

456
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,380
I'm fine, so don't contact me.

457
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,000
All right?

458
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,970
You mustn't contact me.

459
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,110
 Brother? You're listening. Right? 

460
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,140
Yeah.

461
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,730
Don't worry.

462
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,240
Don't worry about me, either, Brother.

463
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,380
I'm really fine.

464
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,700
Understand, Brother?

465
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,430
 Sure. 

466
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,780
I'll hang up now... Brother.

467
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,350
♫  Imma tell you I can't stop now  ♫

468
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,750
♫  Nothing holds me back now  ♫

469
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,730
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

470
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,980
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

471
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,390
♫  Show you I can't fall now  ♫

472
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,620
♫  Cannot tell me to slow down  ♫

473
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,660
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

474
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,000
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

475
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,960
Was there anything out of the ordinary when you met Assemblyman Byeon last night?

476
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,360
I sat and listened to his story about being threatened by his abductor.

477
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,230
What did he say specifically?

478
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,040
He said he made a false confession under threat.

479
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,620
He said he was dragged to the police station for questioning, even though he was the victim.

480
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,490
Assemblyman Byeon agreed to that.

481
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,210
He agreed to make a victim's statement.

482
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,950
We can't confirm anything since the dead don't speak.

483
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,260
I have no intention of quibbling over that.

484
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,650
I'll ask you openly since you already brought the subject up.

485
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,580
Yes, go ahead.

486
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:23,120
A case 27 years ago involved the murder of a homeless man at Lake Sopyeong.

487
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,940
And?

488
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,320
We believe the motive for the murder of not only Assemblyman Byeon

489
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,140
but also Director Shin Kyeong Cheol began at Lake Sopyeong.

490
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,080
Are you saying the culprit for both cases is the same person?

491
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
They're different people.

492
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,230
Did you receive a video from Assemblyman Byeon's abductor yesterday?

493
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,070
Did you?

494
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,850
Why would the abductor send me a video?

495
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,640
I'm asking just in case.

496
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,190
Well, I'm asking just in case,

497
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,410
but are you asking me that because of the false confession?

498
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,800
I'd appreciate it if you took it as a means to determine the confession's authenticity.

499
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,250
For your information, I lack patience and understanding.

500
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,380
I'll leave after asking you one last question.

501
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:21,540
You're the last person Professor Na Sang Woo met before he went missing. Right?

502
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,880
Is the disappearance of Professor Na related to the murder of Assemblyman Byeon?

503
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,910
Professor Na's disappearance is also related to Lake Sopyeong's case,

504
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,790
which is why we're reinvestigating the case.

505
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,510
Now, I understand.

506
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,810
Please don't be offended and just give us a simple answer.

507
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,980
I'm not offended.

508
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,510
I'm curious more than anyone about Professor Na's whereabouts.

509
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,060
Anyway, it must be so tough for you detectives.

510
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,340
How frustrated you must've been to set the investigation direction based on a false confession?

511
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,930
It was an interesting deduction, but I have nothing more to say, unfortunately.

512
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,010
It seems you've wasted your time for nothing.

513
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,670
It's no problem.

514
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,250
You were very helpful.

515
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,690
I look forward to what excuse he'll make once the Lake Sopyeong video is revealed.

516
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,000
This is what Lee Ha Neul was aiming for.

517
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:31,860
Lee Ha Neul sent Byeon Jong Il's confession video to Lee Tae Man.

518
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,990
His gaze wavered when I asked Lee Tae Man if he had received the confession video.

519
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,240
What exactly was Lee Ha Neul after?

520
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,550
To amplify Lee Tae Man's anxiety and distrust, so he'd murder Byeon Jong Il.

521
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,920
It's also why he made Byeon Jong Il talk about Na Sang Woo.

522
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,660
He showed Lee Tae Man that Byeon Jong Il could easily betray him.

523
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,640
The plan was possible since Lee Ha Neul knew exactly what kind of man Lee Tae Man is.

524
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,610
Probably so.

525
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,870
We've been outplayed by Lee Ha Neul.

526
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,500
I'm hesitant to say this,

527
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,260
but I'm glad Lee Ha Neul wasn't the one who murdered Byeon Jong Il.

528
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,270
Where on earth could Lee Ha Neul be? It's not like he's a ghost.

529
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,730
He's a person with a physical body.

530
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,130
- I think Noh Myeong Nam was acquainted with Lee Ha Neul. 
 - What do you mean?

531
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,120
Remember I told you I took Lee Kang San to the hospital?

532
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,210
And?

533
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,250
Kang San saw something from Noh Myeong Nam.

534
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:43,220
He said it looked like Noh Myeong Nam grabbed the legs of a man who was hanging from a tree, trying to save him.

535
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,880
What?

536
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,110
The fact that it was at night in the mountains...

537
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,650
I think Noh Myeong Nam was at the murder scene of Jeon Doo Hyeon.

538
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,200
But it's most likely Lee Ha Neul who disrupted the site.

539
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,320
Since it was the same as Shin Kyeong Cheol's site.

540
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,820
Then...

541
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,500
You're saying Noh Myeong Nam contacted Lee Ha Neul?

542
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,630
I think so.

543
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:11,030
What's weird is that Noh Myeong Nam was unaware of Lee Ha Neul's existence at the time of his interrogation.

544
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,930
 Have you seen this man before? 

545
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,840
 Who is it? 

546
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,540
 His name is Lee Ha Neul, who went missing 27 years ago. 

547
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,590
Lee Ha Neul probably hid his identity from Noh Myeong Nam.

548
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:38,590
I think so. Anyhow, Lee Ha Neul is someone around Noh Myeong Nam.

549
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,120
Where did you go?

550
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:52,920
Kang San, tell me. What's the matter?

551
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,510
I met... Ha Neul today.

552
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,460
You met who?

553
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,710
My brother.

554
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,760
He contacted you?

555
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,330
I found him.

556
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,030
How?

557
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,410
I saw a potential clue from Noh Myeong Nam.

558
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,380
Where is that?

559
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,040
I can't tell you.

560
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,800
It's not because he doesn't trust you. He said it's for your sake.

561
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,150
He also told me not to come back.

562
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,860
I understand my brother.

563
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,890
No matter what anyone says, I don't believe my brother is a bad person.

564
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,880
I would've done the same thing.

565
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,790
Considering all the terrible things he's been through, I can understand whatever he has done.

566
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,890
I don't feel any differently than you do.

567
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:11,420
I hope Ha Neul can live his whole life without getting caught.

568
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:18,310
But that's... not possible just because we wish for it.

569
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,790
And revealing the truth involves both

570
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,010
Ha Neul and me.

571
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:35,250
I don't know what the result will be, but we need to be prepared for the things we have to endure.

572
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:40,640
The truth is always like that. It's uncomfortable and scary.

573
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,480
What's certain is once the video is revealed, we can prove Noh Myeong Nam's innocence.

574
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,290
That alone is worth what we're trying to achieve.

575
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,240
That's probably what Ha Neul is hoping for, too.

576
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,550
Say something.

577
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,440
About what?

578
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,100
You brothers reunited after 27 years. How did it feel?

579
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,710
Are you okay?

580
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,140
Me?

581
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,300
You plan to talk about the novel, too, don't you?

582
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,550
Of course, I should.

583
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,430
Since that was the start for me.

584
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:54,060
I don't know what state of mind Noh Myeong Nam was in when he asked Lee Ha Neul for help,

585
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,720
but I'm sure they were very close.

586
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,330
Probably.

587
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,040
It hadn't been long since Noh Myeong Nam was released from prison, and he didn't have any family,

588
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,630
so I'm thinking they were close neighbors.

589
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,280
Near the cleaner's or his house—

590
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,040
 Have you seen him? 

591
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,920
 Did something happen to this person? 

592
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,370
He resembles that man.

593
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,040
What man?

594
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,880
   

595
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,500
   

596
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,330
Anyone here?

597
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,070
Is anybody here?

598
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,100
Anyone here? It's the police.

599
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,350
I don't think he's home.

600
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,180
It's the perfect hideout.

601
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,760
Let's check the address, find out who lives here and come back.

602
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,220
Okay.

603
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,270
What happened to Assemblyman Byeon?

604
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,970
He died.

605
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,100
Exactly. How did he die?

606
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,130
Why are you asking me?

607
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,650
There's nothing you don't know, Chairman.

608
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,770
Should I tell you something amusing?

609
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,010
What is it?

610
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:41,350
That picture of the student I showed you last time.

611
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,340
He looks exactly the same as Lee Ha Neul's younger brother.

612
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,570
- Ha Neul's younger brother? 
 - Yeah.

613
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:55,810
Back then, I saw him once in front of the school, so my memory was hazy.

614
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,330
That doesn't sound that amusing.

615
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,560
Hear me out until the end.

616
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,850
I did some digging

617
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:13,610
and found out that the student has a special talent.

618
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,980
Like a supernatural power.

619
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,720
Are you drunk already?

620
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,020
This is where it gets really amusing.

621
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,160
That student...

622
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,520
met Lee Ha Neul today.

623
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,430
Surprised, aren't you? Kang Hye Kyeong, you're really surprised.

624
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,980
Of course. It's surprising news.

625
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,200
So? You found Ha Neul?

626
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,250
I did.

627
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,360
Where is he?

628
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,590
 I'm not the one who killed a person. 

629
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,090
 You should take your revenge on them. Why are you doing this to me? 

630
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:11,390
 Who are the ones you mentioned? 

631
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,360
 Why are you asking me? 

632
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,490
 You were also at the scene. 

633
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,010
 Tell me what you know. 

634
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,360
 Who are those bastards? 

635
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,110
 If I tell you that, will you let me go? 

636
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,860
 Only if you answer the rest of the questions honestly. 

637
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,450
 And you're going to hand this recording over to the press after? 

638
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:39,150
 I don't trust the press. 

639
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:45,590
 And you're not the one who I want to put an end to. 

640
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,180
It's been a while.

641
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,010
Wow.

642
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,880
Look who it is.

643
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,060
It's good to see you, Lee Ha Neul.

644
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,850
Hye Kyeong, what are you doing?

645
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,470
Aren't you going to say hi?

646
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,370
I'm sorry, but can you give us some space?

647
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,300
   

648
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,640
I expected a tearful reunion. How anticlimactic.

649
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,860
How did you think to come here?

650
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,520
I thought you'd hide your entire life like a rat.

651
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,800
I felt I should meet you at least once before dying.

652
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,320
- Are you dying? 
 - No.

653
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,300
You, Lee Tae Man.

654
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,730
I never knew you could make people laugh.

655
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,080
You're not human, though.

656
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,490
Why did you come here?

657
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,260
I don't think it was to play Byeon Jong Il's false confession.

658
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,940
- I wanted to thank you. 
 - Go ahead.

659
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,150
Thanks for killing Byeon Jong Il.

660
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,350
What nonsense are you spewing?

661
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,600
Why do you think I sent you the video?

662
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,860
Childish threats won't work on me.

663
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,010
And why do you think I let Byeon Jong Il go?

664
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,380
You want me to give you the answer you want?

665
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,810
You probably wanted me to kill Byeon Jong Il.

666
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,530
This third question is the most important one.

667
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:35,750
Do you think I let Byeon Jong Il go without any plans?

668
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:43,340
Now, you're a suspect in a murder case with a live statute of limitations.

669
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,430
It sounds like you have evidence.

670
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,900
You guessed right.

671
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,990
You haven't changed.

672
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,580
Your humanity is terrible, but your brain is even worse.

673
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,800
You murderer!

674
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:11,100
You must've forgotten, but you're the murderer.

675
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,370
Lee Ha Neul is dead.

676
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:22,820
You can try to prove how a dead person could murder someone.

677
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,670
There's no reason I can't.

678
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:29,080
Before that, I'm thinking about meeting your brother first.

679
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,080
Is that okay?

680
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,880
I think you're the one who's not okay, Lee Tae Man.

681
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,700
It was nice seeing you.

682
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,290
It's been a while.

683
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,820
   

684
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,250
It's you, isn't it?

685
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,340
You're working with Lee Ha Neul, aren't you? Since when?

686
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,390
That's right. You have been like that since 27 years ago, ever since then.

687
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:12,840
You also hid Lee Ha Neul back then. Right?

688
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,970
Gosh, first loves are... quite formidable.

689
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,910
So, did you two sleep together?

690
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,770
Get lost.

691
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:35,510
- Let go. 
 - Please go home now.

692
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,440
All of you, stop it now!

693
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,820
- Hey, Tae Man! 
 - Shit!

694
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,730
Tae Man! Tae Man.

695
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,490
Now is not the time to fight amongst ourselves.

696
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,720
The fact that Lee Ha Neul came here means he has something up his sleeve.

697
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,160
We'll take the hit at this rate.

698
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,820
How long will you bum around like this?

699
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,520
You mutt.

700
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,300
Is whining the only thing you know how to do?

701
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:06,780
How long-How much longer do I have to listen to your whining?

702
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,980
I made you Inspector General, so make my choice worth it!

703
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,920
You killed Sang Woo, didn't you?

704
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,790
What?

705
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,480
How are you so proud when you've killed your friend?

706
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,690
You killed that homeless man 27 years ago, too.

707
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,040
This is your last chance.

708
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,920
You're dead next time. You understand?

709
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,460
Yes.

710
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,260
   

711
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,120
   

712
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,700
   

713
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,480
I checked the personal information of the container address resident.

714
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,370
His name is Jeon Chang Geun, and he's 46 years old.

715
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:42,780
- And his occupation? 
 - He's a librarian at the Maru Library.

716
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,860
- A librarian? 
 - Yes.

717
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:49,520
His only family is his father, but he has dementia, so he currently resides at a nursing home.

718
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,710
There's nothing unusual on paper, but I'm going back tomorrow.

719
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,200
Have you seen this before?

720
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,940
What is it?

721
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,790
Yook Dong Joo was sending messages to Lee Ha Neul.

722
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,650
   

723
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,400
   

724
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,160
It seems like Writer Yook tried to meet Lee Ha Neul because of Kang San.

725
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,570
He's very worried about him.

726
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:20,790
If Lee Ha Neul read these posts, I think he probably reached out to Yook Dong Joo.

727
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,610
He never told me they met.

728
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,840
You should obtain the videotape for now.

729
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,530
All right.

730
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,900
Writer Yook!

731
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,100
On your way back from somewhere?

732
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,900
I met with someone regarding the release of the video.

733
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,600
You should hand over the video to us instead of dealing with it yourself.

734
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,860
Let's talk inside.

735
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,750
Did you meet Lee Ha Neul by any chance?

736
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,030
I saw the posts you uploaded on your homepage.

737
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:17,210
If he read those posts, Lee Ha Neul would've learned about Kang San.

738
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,890
If that's the case, he probably reached out to you.

739
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,360
I don't want Lee Ha Neul to get arrested.

740
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,820
I'll reveal the main culprits of Lake Sopyeong

741
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,650
and do anything I can to help if it means they'll pay the price for their crimes.

742
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:44,730
But... arresting Lee Ha Neul lies on your shoulders.

743
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,750
Does that mean you know where Lee Ha Neul is?

744
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,180
Even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

745
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,650
But honestly, I don't know.

746
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,120
I can't even take a guess.

747
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,460
All right. Let's go inside.

748
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,210
 Kick him! 

749
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,290
 Why are you doing this? 

750
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,240
Kang San.

751
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,390
Kang San!

752
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,100
Kang San.

753
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,200
Kang San.

754
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,330
Kang San!

755
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,820
He'll be better once he gets some sleep. Don't worry.

756
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,140
- Okay. Have a seat. 
 - Sure.

757
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:40,460
Thank you for coming when I called you out of the blue.

758
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,390
It's no problem.

759
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,850
But is this a frequent occurrence?

760
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,330
No.

761
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:52,040
It's the first time he fainted at home.

762
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,630
His pulse is very weak.

763
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,630
What do you think is the cause?

764
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:05,250
I think it's mainly due to psychological factors, but each patient is different.

765
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,870
He'll need a general check-up once he stabilizes.

766
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,300
Yes, I understand.

767
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:41,520
This video is enough to arrest Lee Tae Man and Choi Jong Nam.

768
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,000
Please give me the original copy, Writer Yook.

769
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,800
Once I reveal the video, I'll hand it over.

770
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,730
If you personally take action, you'll go through a lot of trouble.

771
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,370
I'm prepared for that much.

772
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,190
What are you planning to do?

773
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:08,360
Before those in power have a chance to make a move,

774
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:13,690
I'll make it quick and clear, so the entire nation becomes aware.

775
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,470
I'll be very clear.

776
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,460
You're planning to hand it to the press?

777
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,400
It'll be over as soon as tomorrow.

778
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,180
- Tomorrow? 
 - Yes.

779
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:30,770
Once this is all over, let's drink soju together.

780
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:59,300
   

781
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,170
   

782
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,380
 - He's a genius. 
 - Please make a copy. 

783
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,080
 Did you really write this yourself? 

784
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,350
 - Of course, I did. Why? 
 - Let's publish it. 

785
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,680
 I'll make it a best seller for you. 

786
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,690
 Grab the chance when it's here. I won't offer it to you twice. 

787
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,220
   

788
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:49,710
♫  At the end of this tunnel, there will be light  ♫

789
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,550
♫  Burn like the sun in the sky, it's gonna be all right  ♫

790
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:03,540
♫  The day I was trapped in a repeating world  ♫

791
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:09,190
♫  Hold me so I can wake up again  ♫

792
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,690
   
   

793
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:19,470
   
   

794

♫  What makes me live more is what I breathe  ♫

795
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,970
Hey, Dong Joo. It's me.

796
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,390
The higher-ups accept all your conditions.

797
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:35,100
Yeah.

798
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,960
♫  Burn like the sun in the sky, it's gonna be all right  ♫

Okay, standby! Five seconds left!

01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,480
   

801
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,470
Swift and accurate, delivering the hottest news.

802
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:11,630
This is News Head.

803
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:16,130
Today's head interview guest is Yook Dong Joo,

804
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:23,860
the novelist who won the Korean Literature Award for his novel "God Is Dead."

805
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:26,230
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

806
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:28,770
Thank you for joining us.

807
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,150
I heard there's a special reason you're here today.

808
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,420
Can you tell us the reason in detail?

809
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,770
First,

810
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:48,490
I'd appreciate it if you could watch the video I brought with me.

811
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,960
Oh, shall we?

812
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,560
All right, let's watch the video first.

813
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,030
 Step on him! 

814
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,360
 Hey! 

815
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,400
♫  I keep fighting, still fighting  ♫

816
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,560
♫  The fate ahead of me can never stop  ♫

817

♫  No matter how many times I'm born again  ♫

819
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,590
   

820
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,510
 Are you speaking of confirmed truth? 

821
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,470
 It must've been on someone's orders. 

822
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,250
 The police only have to keep walking straight ahead. 

823
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,010
 We have to shift the people's focus to something other than the Lake Sopyeong case. 

824
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,010
 It's a partial exaggeration... 

825
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,270
 I met your father two days ago. 

826
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,930
 I wanted confirmation. 

827
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,290
 I only look ahead. 

828
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,870
 You did something very useless. 

829
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,240
 Who do you think is worse off? 

830
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,910
 Where are the children who disappeared from Cheonyoung Orphanage? 

831
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,500
 I'm going to expose you, so just wait. 

832
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,700
♫  The times I fell asleep in the dark  ♫
