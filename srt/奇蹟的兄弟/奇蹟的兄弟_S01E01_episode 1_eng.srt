1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:13,060


2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,293
I totally understand, okay?

3
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:31,603
It's not like you're a maniac. You must've had your reasons.

4
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,013
You wouldn't do this to me without a reason.

5
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,543
But hey. We're still friends. Right?

6
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:40,033
Don't be sorry about this and contact me.

7
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,943
You got that?

8
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,013
You're not skipping meals. Right?

9
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,182
- Just give me a call— 
  - You have run out of time. 

10
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,385
-  If you want to deliver your message...  
 - What the heck is this? Damn it... 
    

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,011
Hey, you bloody lunatic!

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,103
Hey, it's not that I'm mad. I'm just worried!

13
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:17,353
You— No.

14
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:20,073
You just come home first.

15
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:23,186
Come right away!

16
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,803
Ouch!

17
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,200
   
   

18
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,993
   

19
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,783
- Doc, we need to do CPR. 
 - I got it.

20
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,480
   

21
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,933
 Hyung. 

22
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,593
Wait, s-so what happened?

23
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,273
What's the name of the patient?

24
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,233
I don't know.

25
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:00,483
I'm Lieutenant Park Hyeon Soo from Traffic Investigations.

26
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:04,043
The victim has not been identified yet.

27
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,533
The current time is 11:33 p.m.

28
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:16,173
The patient has passed away.

29
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,013
Excuse me. I have a few things to ask about the unidentified patient.

30
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,383
 Hyung. 

31
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,343
 Hyung. 

32
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,403
Doctor! Doctor!

33
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,643
   

34
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:21,393
Why's there only half again?

35
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:22,473
What do you mean?

36
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:24,323
Why are you paying only half of the rent?

37
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:27,053
    
 Of course, I'd pay half. Why would I pay more?

38
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,023
You said you two would pay 500,000 won when you were moving in.

39
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,983
I said two would pay 500,000 won. Did I say I'll pay 500,000 won by myself?

40
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,633
I paid my half. So you need to find Sang Il and get the rest.

41
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,683
It's your roommate who ran away, so why would I look for him?

42
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:45,013
You need to get Sang Il's due from Sang Il. So it's right for you to look for him.

43
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,263
He's your friend!

44
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:51,173
He even took my credit card and ran off. Is that what a friend does?

45
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,643
He took cash out of your card?

46
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:54,683
Yes. He took out three million won in cash!

47
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:57,363
Three million? My god, he's not even a friend.

48
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,653
That's what I'm saying.

49
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:02,123
The contest deadline is coming up, but I can't even write my novel. I feel so betrayed.

50
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:04,273
You need to pay that back quickly. The interests will pile up.

51
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:07,153
I know. So I need to go to my part-time job right now.

52
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:09,163
- I need to earn whatever I can. 
 - Yes, you should.

53
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,743
Okay, I'll be going. Please be sure to eat and take care.

54
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:12,183
- Sure. See you. 
 - Okay.

55
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,463
Gosh.

56
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:14,683
What a life...

57
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:17,613
Hey! Stop right there!

58
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,103
 Numerous women have come forward, accusing famous film director Shin Kyeong Cheol 

59
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,383
 of sexual harassment and assault. 

60
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:54,053
 However, the investigation has been weak due to insufficient evidence. 

61
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:58,073
 The police requested that Shin Kyeong Cheol submit the laptop the victims mentioned 

62
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,563
 which they consider to be the conclusive evidence. 

63
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,233
 But Director Shin has denied all allegations and 

64
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,173
 claims that he cannot submit the laptop as it has been lost. 

65
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,973
Geez...

66
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,993
No, not here.

67
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,113
Hey, Yong Dae, later. I'm about to let loose.

68
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:36,793
What?

69
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:38,573
Mother, please open the door.

70
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,213
I'm Yong Dae!

71
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,620
I'm Dong Joo's friend, Yong Dae!

72
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,573
Please open the door!

73
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,453
This is an obstruction of justice.

74
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:51,073
- Hurry up and open the door— 
 - Hey!

75
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,563
Don't do that.

76
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:57,313
Mother, it'll be okay. So trust me, and please open the door.

77
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,813
10 minutes. I'll get out in 10 minutes.

78
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,230
You can't do that and...

79
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,970
Hey, move aside.

80
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,463
I think she's had a few drinks.

81
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,733
Mom, o-open the door.

82
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,383
Hurry.

83
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,393
Why did you come? You're busy.

84
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:21,273
Hurry up and open the door! Seriously.

85
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,633
Don't get mad at me!

86
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,033
Geez, seriously.

87
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,303
Mom, you trust me. Right?

88
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,673
Hurry up and open the door. I'll take care of this.

89
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:36,683
Hurry up and open it before I break it open!

90
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:39,013
Open the door!

91
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,633
   

92
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,563
 Yes. 

93
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,603
That's right.

94
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:53,613
Her BAC level is 0.09. She might get a prison sentence.

95
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,033
This has to be settled out of court.

96
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,743
They're asking for 15 million won for settlement.

97
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,173
That's terrible.

98
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,593
That's why I would like to ask you for a favor.

99
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:09,283
Ask me?

100
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:15,973
Could you give 15 million won from my mom's lease deposit and make it a monthly rent with the rest?

101
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:19,173
That's the only way we have.

102
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:21,813
Gosh, you didn't know, huh?

103
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:23,053
D-Didn't know what?

104
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:26,713
Your mom changed it to monthly rent quite a while ago.

105
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,733
 Gosh, why am I so unlucky? 

106
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,473
   
 I should've just stayed home. 

107
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:38,213
Dong Joo!

108
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,003
Please take care, Mother.

109
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,443
Okay.

110
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,203
Dong Joo!

111
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,823
- Dong Joo! 
 - What?

112
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,313
You need to take your mother with you.

113
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:03,740
Gosh, forget it! I can go alone.

114
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:08,493
I can forgive you regardless of whatever wrong you've done.

115
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:12,673
Even if you were a serial killer, I'd protect and defend you to the end. Because I'm your mom.

116
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,453
I'm your son, not your mom!

117
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:19,343
Moms become kids when they get old. Can't you just be understanding?

118
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,313
Is this something to be understood?

119
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,973
Why would you drink and drive?

120
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,933
Are you trying to kill someone?

121
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:30,113
I only lightly touched the tire! Just lightly like this!

122
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:33,203
Do you hear yourself right now?

123
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:35,563
I only had three shots during lunch.

124
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:36,693
The owner of the restaurant I work at—

125
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:39,153
You only had three shots, and you get a 0.09 reading?

126
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:41,573
You lie whenever you open your mouth!

127
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:44,573
When did I lie?

128
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,223
What did you do with your lease deposit?

129
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,593
Again?

130
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,473
You got scammed by another guy?

131
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,043
Dong Joo...

132
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,923
I invested it. He said he'd make it grow many folds.

133
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,343
Wake up and come to your senses!

134
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,363
You got scammed yet again?

135
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,653
Are you an idiot, Mom?

136
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:07,143
I just wanted to help you out! I didn't want you to work tough jobs and struggle.

137
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,963
Do you even care about your son?

138
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,593
You only care about yourself the most!

139
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,083
How can you say that to your mom?

140
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,183
After all the trouble I went through to send you to college?

141
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,963
What did you do for me?

142
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,663
I fed myself, and I worked to pay my tuition on my own.

143
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:23,543
If you're that great, why do you live like that without a job?

144
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,083
Your head is stuck in the clouds with the writer crap.

145
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,233
I'm really going to lose it.

146
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,720
Yong Joo, calm down and—

147
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,290
No, forget it.

148
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,913
I can't do this any longer, either.

149
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:37,533
Whether you go to jail or not, you take care of your own life.

150
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,010
Did I ever ask you to take care of my life?

151
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,430
Exactly!

152
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,293
So do as you please. All right?

153
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,573
Good god.

154
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:50,353
Dong Joo!

155
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,083
Damn it...

156
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,983
That jerk.

157
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,153
 Right after the lightning struck, he jumped out of nowhere through the wall and bumped into my car. 

158
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:20,373
How can a person jump out of a wall?

159
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:22,953
The situation really was just like that.

160
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:25,123
Does that even make sense?

161
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,963
I'm figuratively saying that the person just appeared out of nowhere right now.

162
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:36,073
Don't give me figurative answers, and just give me the facts.

163
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:40,243
There's no such thing as facts. Whatever you want to believe is your fact.

164
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,403
Gosh, I'm sorry.

165
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:52,443
I'm about to mentally break down because of bad things happening all at once.

166
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:55,683
- Did the victim not have any belongings? 
 - No.

167
00:13:55,683 --> 00:14:00,083
- Submit your car's black box. 
 - Okay.

168
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,633
Heaven saved you today, Mr. Yook.

169
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,803
The victim, who died, came back to life.

170
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,513
Just like a miracle.

171
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,603
Let's see...

172
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,353
   
   

173
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,383
Damn it.

174
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,393
Did the main board die?

175
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,753
I guess I should check his name, at least.

176
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,103
Will he regain consciousness?

177
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:26,143
We'll have to see.

178
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,773
 Over there. 

179
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,823
What's this...

180
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,343
   

181
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,543
   

182
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:38,083
   

183
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,163
   

184
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,953
   

185
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,413
"God Is Dead."

186
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:32,583
   

187
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,193
I-I'm sorry for what—

188
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:38,433
Where did the patient in Room 4102 go? Did anyone see him?

189
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,683
   

190
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:50,453
   

191
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,393
   

192
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:57,633
   

193
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:01,453
   

194
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,653
   

195
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:27,283
   

196
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,833
   

197
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,123
   

198
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:38,423
   

199
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:41,783
   

200
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,683
   

201
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,143
   

202
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,893
Whoa! He's a genius.

203
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:27,263
Excuse me.

204
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,513
Are you okay?

205
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:35,573
What are you doing here?

206
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:37,993
I have something to tell Seon Ae.

207
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,063
There's something...

208
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:43,193
I must tell Seon Ae—

209
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,603
Please call Dr. Lee Soo Yeon.

210
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:48,203
Okay.

211
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:57,403
Gosh! What time is it?

212
00:22:57,403 --> 00:22:59,923
- Awesome, this is awesome. 
 - My head...

213
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,793
Geez, you scared me.

214
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:05,983
What the hell? When did you come?

215
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,903
Why complain when you finished writing all this?

216
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:11,033
Give it back.

217
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,473
Why did you come? Don't you have to go to work?

218
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:17,203
I was worried since you left like that, and I couldn't reach you.

219
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:21,693
Why didn't you put some eggs in there?

220
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,183
You'll win this time for sure.

221
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:26,153
What?

222
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:30,403
The story sucks you in like hell.

223
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:31,743
Oh, this?

224
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,913
Excellent writing, an amazing insight about good and evil,

225
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,153
a profound observation of humans, and an interesting story!

226
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:38,563
It's not like that.

227
00:23:38,563 --> 00:23:39,963
No need to be humble.

228
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:42,913
I've been thinking not so highly of you. I apologize.

229
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:45,323
- That's not it— 
 - Don't you trust me?

230
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,453
I was in the same literature club with you for three years!

231
00:23:47,453 --> 00:23:50,413
I may not be able to write, but my interpretation and critique are quite elevated!

232
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,613
Gosh, you're so loud.

233
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,443
I'll guarantee it! You'll win for sure this time!

234
00:23:54,443 --> 00:23:57,733
This one will be a bestseller for sure! A steady seller!

235
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:02,253
That's my Yook Dong Joo, a reincarnation of Yoon Dong Joo. 
  (A famous Korean poet.) 

236
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,373
Just eat your damn ramen.

237
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:06,113
- Come on, let me finish reading. 
 - No, forget it.

238
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,423
Gosh, gosh.

239
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,643
You need to settle it somehow. Your mom really might end up in jail.

240
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,643
My mom needs to get some senses smacked into her.

241
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:20,863
Hey, I gave it some thought and—

242
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:22,433
I'll be doing the thinking.

243
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,703
Okay, then I'll just talk.

244
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:26,683
I heard you know the second son of Taekang Group well.

245
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,383
Are you telling me to ask that bastard for help?

246
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:32,753
You can tell him you'll pay him back when you win the competition.

247
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:34,553
I'd rather sell my organs.

248
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:37,923
He seems decent, being a CEO of a publishing company when he's already a conglomerate.

249
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:39,923
How naïve. It means he wants to take it all.

250
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,863
Money and honor both.

251
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:44,793
 Many people misunderstand like that. 

252
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:48,383
"Isn't he trying to take over the publishing market when he's already a conglomerate?"

253
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:50,943
"Isn't he trying to evade tax through the publishing company?"

254
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:55,023
"He'll go back to inherit the family business in the end," and so on.

255
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:59,483
I know well that many people have an unkind opinion of me.

256
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,643
It is a little unfair.

257
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:08,063
Because I'm just a person... who likes to read books...

258
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:12,133
write literature, and hold debates with my friends.

259
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:16,393
In short, I guess you can say I'm crazy about books.

260
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:19,603
A mansion? My publishing company is?

261
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,663
Not at all. It's an adequate size.

262
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:26,003
The doors of my publishing company are always wide open.

263
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:28,123
Anyone is welcome to visit.

264
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:32,643
I hope it becomes a place where families come with their kids to read books, drink tea,

265
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:36,333
and have conversations. A place to communicate.

266
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,093
    
 Please make a copy.

267
00:25:41,303 --> 00:25:43,313
There are various contents now. Right?

268
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:47,363
Which means there are that many books to read.

269
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:49,093
Me?

270
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:51,793
I especially like novels.

271
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,763
Because I believe a good book

272
00:25:53,763 --> 00:25:57,843
that's easily approachable also has the strong power

273
00:25:57,843 --> 00:26:00,623
to move a person's heart and purify it.

274
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:02,813
If I were to talk about my goal...

275
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:07,903
it'd be to accompany talented rookie writers who are having a difficult time

276
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:11,443
to publish their work because of their poor environment.

277
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:14,303
That's my hope.

278
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,253
How was your interview?

279
00:26:17,253 --> 00:26:19,023
I had a fun time.

280
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:24,333
I want to confirm the edited version of the interview before it airs.

281
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,933
- Please check on it. 
 - Okay.

282
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:34,013
Did I make you wait?

283
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:35,553
Not at all. 
    

284
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,303
It's your first time here. Right?

285
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:41,783
Yes.

286
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,493
Take a seat.

287
00:26:47,443 --> 00:26:48,973
How are you doing?

288
00:26:49,763 --> 00:26:52,333
Well, you know. It's the same.

289
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,483
You still do deliveries?

290
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:56,933
As usual?

291
00:26:58,123 --> 00:26:59,993
Yes.

292
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:04,883
Since it keeps me moving, it's a good exercise... and it actually helps me write better.

293
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:07,213
Oh, really?

294
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:10,703
Our bodies are closely connected to our brains, you know.

295
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:13,513
The more you move your body, the better your memory.

296
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:19,243
And the hormones produced by muscle cells during exercise activate our cognitive ability.

297
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:22,933
Above all, encountering people directly gets me to study them and

298
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,963
I also gain realistic material. It's like killing two birds with one stone.

299
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,703
How great.

300
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:31,043
Hey, by the way, I'm a little busy.

301
00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:33,243
I have an appointment with a writer.

302
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:35,893
Oh, is that so?

303
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:37,523
Cut to the chase.

304
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,183
You said you have something to say.

305
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:41,763
Yes.

306
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,310
   

307
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:46,193
Come on, what is it?

308
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,793
Let me borrow some money.

309
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:52,533
Money?

310
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,833
- How much? 
 - 15 million won.

311
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:57,993
Okay.

312
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:01,623
Thanks.

313
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:04,733
But when will you pay me back?

314
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,833
You know about the Korean Literature Competition. Right?

315
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,193
I'll pay you back with interest as soon as I get the prize.

316
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:15,683
Hey, buying a lottery would have a higher chance.

317
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:19,283
Wouldn't winning the lottery be more likely than winning the prize?

318
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:22,183
I was one of the finalists in last year's competition.

319
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:24,363
I also lost at the finals the year before that.

320
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:27,283
That's what's killing you.

321
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:28,113
What?

322
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:32,493
This is my advice for you as a friend from a literature club.

323
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,753
Giving up also takes courage.

324
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:38,183
You can't become a writer by working hard. You're born as one.

325
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,493
Don't you already know?

326
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:43,803
So are you saying you'll lend me the money or what?

327
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:48,193
I value credibility more than money.

328
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,993
Why make a promise you can't keep?

329
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:51,843
How do you know I can't keep it?

330
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:54,963
I know you have talent. I know that, but...

331
00:28:56,793 --> 00:29:02,023
but it's not good enough for first place.

332
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:03,593
It'll be difficult.

333
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:15,833
    
 Read it first and talk about whether I'm good enough to win or not.

334
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:21,413
I'll read it when I have time.

335
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:24,233
Just read two pages.

336
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:27,033
You won't be able to let it go.

337
00:29:34,503 --> 00:29:36,093
Gosh.

338
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,733
Damn it!

339
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,953
That damn hypocrite.

340
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,253
Real asshole. Bloody beanpole.

341
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:51,883
Gosh! I hate that bastard.

342
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:53,913
Geez, damn it!

343
00:29:56,583 --> 00:30:00,823
Geez! Seriously. This crappy car!

344
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,770
   

345
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,540
   

346
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,173
Did you check the black box footage?

347
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:07,413
They can't check because it's damaged.

348
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:08,593
It's damaged? Why?

349
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:09,973
It short-circuited.

350
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:14,133
- Short circuit? 
 - All the CCTVs on the site are also broken.

351
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,153
They were hit by lightning.

352
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:26,023
 He briefly regained consciousness in the middle of the night and lost it again. 

353
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,063
I heard he was able to walk and talk.

354
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:32,113
Yes, he said something unintelligible, but we couldn't understand him.

355
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,953
Is this situation common?

356
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:38,563
It's a first for me, too.

357
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:41,223
When will he regain consciousness?

358
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:51,303
He could wake up tomorrow, or he might never wake up. I can't guarantee anything.

359
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:56,873
Wait! What do you mean, never wake up?

360
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:59,613
You said all his exams came back normal.

361
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:04,063
There were no signs of brain damage in the MRI.

362
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,713
There was no oxygen supply to his brain for more than 20 minutes,

363
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:10,153
but the fact that he came back to life without any damage is a miracle.

364
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:13,403
He was also amazingly uninjured anywhere.

365
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:16,353
There's just one thing.

366
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,773
His right brain is bigger than his left brain.

367
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:28,213
We can't tell if it's temporary due to the accident or if he was born that way.

368
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:30,523
Were you able to reach his guardian?

369
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,593
We can't identify the victim.

370
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:34,403
Didn't you say you'll look up his fingerprint?

371
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:35,643
Nothing came up.

372
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,323
He looks like a minor, but there's no missing report on him, either.

373
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:41,683
Isn't there any other way besides looking up his fingerprints?

374
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:44,863
They might not have reported him missing, thinking he simply ran away from home.

375
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,903
So we'll have to wait.

376
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:49,223
For the victim to regain conscience takes top priority.

377
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,043
Gosh, that's true.

378
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:54,953
I think having his belongings would give me a hint, at least.

379
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:56,483
Oh, right.

380
00:31:56,483 --> 00:32:00,873
I forgot about it yesterday because I was so out of it.

381
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:03,053
In fact, I...

382
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:07,113
One second, please.

383
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:09,393
Yes, Team Leader.

384
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:11,483
No.

385
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:13,093
Yes.

386
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:31,793
Hey. 
    

387
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:37,733
Did you really write this yourself?

388
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:40,593
Of course, I did. Why?

389
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:42,373
Did you finish reading it already?

390
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:44,083
 About half. 

391
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,583
You stopped reading midway?

392
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,453
 Let's publish it. 

393
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,193
What do you mean?

394
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:53,383
I'll publish this one for you.

395
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:56,473
Wait, I- I said it's for the competition.

396
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,893
 You said you need money right now. 

397
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,463
You said you c-can't let me borrow from you because you don't trust me.

398
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,023
Let's sign a contract.

399
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,993
I'll make it a best seller for you.

400
00:33:04,993 --> 00:33:09,173
 I can pay you the signing fee as soon as tomorrow, including that of the sequel. 

401
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:16,873
The open ending and rushed writing bother me a bit.

402
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:20,993
But no one will say anything regarding editing, so that's entirely up to you.

403
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:22,683
 Wait. 

404
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:25,073
Grab the chance when it's here.

405
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,463
 I won't offer it twice. 

406
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:40,123
   

407
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:42,083
   

408
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,693
One, two, three!

409
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:48,083
Okay, that's all.

410
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:51,303
Dong Joo, you forgot this!

411
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:55,443
You almost forgot the trace of Writer Yook Dong Joo's blood, tears, and sweat.

412
00:34:01,003 --> 00:34:02,223
   

413
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:06,973
I noticed you lost so many competitions.

414
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,533
   
   

415
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:14,623
   

416
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:15,883
   
   

417
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,973
   

418
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:21,483
   

419
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:23,993
   

420
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:26,523
   
   

421
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:31,323
   

422
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:35,373
   

423
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,713
   
   

424
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:45,753
This place will be a sacred place for aspiring writers now.

425
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,683
A sacred place, my foot.

426
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:49,943
Enjoy the joy of success all you want.

427
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:51,923
You have the right.

428
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,453
Let's go.

429
00:34:59,703 --> 00:35:01,403
 Yes. 

430
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:04,103
 I already crossed the Rubicon River and 

431
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,963
 the dice have been cast. 

432
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:09,213
 Let's not look back. 

433
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,593
   

434
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:20,123
   

435
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:27,473
   

436
00:35:43,963 --> 00:35:47,373
   

437
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,773
Gosh, I said you don't need to come.

438
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:39,033
This place has everything, so I only brought my books.

439
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:41,503
I told you it's all done already.

440
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:44,883
I have dinner plans with the publishing company people.

441
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:48,033
I'm sure you're busy since you're an author now.

442
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,503
And you've got many people to meet.

443
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:55,023
The publishing company bought you an expensive house since you're a dear author now.

444
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:57,963
Gosh, you're really the best, my son.

445
00:36:57,963 --> 00:37:01,043
 They didn't buy it for me. They lent it to me as a study. 

446
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:04,773
I knew my son would succeed as an author.

447
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:07,463
Your conception dream was quite unique.

448
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:10,413
I saw a python and a tiger in one dream.

449
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:14,123
I didn't even know it was a conception dream and bought a lottery ticket.

450
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:18,233
 Getting one novel published doesn't mean I'm successful. 

451
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:20,323
Is it that easy to become an author?

452
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,713
You're just like your dad.

453
00:37:21,713 --> 00:37:23,793
Your dad loved books a lot, too.

454
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:25,893
It's already late, Mom. Bye now.

455
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:28,363
No, hang up now. Bye.

456
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,193
Are you using this?

457
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:33,103
What is it?

458
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,493
Should we throw it out? It looks way too worn out.

459
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:37,553
No, j-just give it to me.

460
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:41,533
You're a renowned author now, so get yourself a nice bag.

461
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,823
Gosh, forget that.

462
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:48,063
Whoa...

463
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:52,783
A conglomerate publishing company surely works on a different scale.

464
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:54,703
It looks like those houses I see on TV.

465
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:56,493
It's a prison.

466
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:58,763
A prison they put me in, telling me to write and do nothing else.

467
00:37:58,763 --> 00:38:01,103
I also want to be locked up here.

468
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:02,613
Oh, right.

469
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,363
Hey...

470
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:08,343
Sign it for me.

471
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:12,233
W-Why sign it?

472
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,823
So I can boast about it for generations.

473
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:17,263
I'll sign one for you when I publish my next book.

474
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,913
That one's a separate thing. Come on.

475
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,963
Wait! Where did I see a pen?

476
00:38:22,963 --> 00:38:26,033
A debut work holds special meaning, doesn't it?

477
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:33,943
   

478
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:41,523
Doctor...

479
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,630
   

480
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:17,533
Did you find anything?

481
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:20,663
The corpse decayed a lot, so it's hard to identify him by just looking.

482
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:22,583
But I think it is Shin Kyeong Cheol.

483
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:26,273
The car is owned by Shin Kyeong Cheol, and his ID was found in the car, too.

484
00:39:26,273 --> 00:39:29,593
Don't jump to conclusions and wait for the NFS results.

485
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:31,833
Why did you call Park Hyeon Soo over?

486
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,013
It's about time for her to come back.

487
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,533
You said she'll start tomorrow.

488
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,523
Today or tomorrow, it's the same.

489
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,763
Hey, cut her some slack.

490
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:48,673
Losing a colleague weighs on Park Hyeon Soo just as much.

491
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:55,873
What is that?

492
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:57,923
Oh, you're back at work?

493
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,473
What's that?

494
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:01,813
This was inside the victim's mouth.

495
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,923
The culprit intentionally placed it there?

496
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:07,153
He sealed it with duct tape, so it was intentional.

497
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:19,043
 The police launched an investigation after the body of a man was found in 

498
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:22,973
 film director Shin Kyeong Cheol's vehicle who was reported missing two months ago. 

499
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:24,813
 Around 12:40 p.m. today, 

500
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:28,743
 a diver who was working underwater to purify Lake Sopyeong 

501
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:33,053
 found the vehicle and reported it to the police. 

502
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:36,933
 Currently, the police have collected DNA from Director Shin Kyeong Cheol's family 

503
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:39,463
 and submitted it to the National Forensic Service 

504
00:40:39,463 --> 00:40:42,293
 to identify the body and determine the cause of death. 

505
00:40:42,293 --> 00:40:45,183
 The police requested that the public refrain from excessive speculation 

506
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:50,463
 regarding the case as they are investigating with open possibilities. 

507
00:40:50,463 --> 00:40:53,423
 After winning the grand prize at the 29th Union Film Festival for "Resurrection of Judas—" 

508
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:55,213
You're on a case as soon as you return.

509
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:57,263
How have you been?

510
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:59,923
All is peaceful for this sergeant about to retire.

511
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:02,733
What happened? Did you get the results from the NFS?

512
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:04,893
- They said to expect it by tomorrow. 
 - And the USB?

513
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:07,703
I'll check as soon as the NFS finishes identifying the fingerprints.

514
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:09,473
Don't just wait for the NFS results.

515
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:11,993
Re-investigate Shin Kyeong Cheol's activities on the day of his disappearance from the beginning

516
00:41:11,993 --> 00:41:13,623
and start investigating the people around him.

517
00:41:13,623 --> 00:41:17,753
All right,the lake has washed away all traces of the culprit.

518
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:20,573
But that shouldn't stop us from catching him.

519
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:22,343
- Kang Jae Soo. 
 - Sir.

520
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:26,093
How many CCTVs are there from Shin Kyeong Cheol's house to the crime scene?

521
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:29,883
- Around 150...  
 - 215.

522
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:32,953
You get the picture, right? You shouldn't just be sitting here. Right?

523
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:35,183
- Sir. 
 - Sir!

524
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:39,723
- Park Hyeon Soo, start looking into Shin Kyeong Cheol's activities on the day of his disappearance. 
 - Yes, sir.

525
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,993
Work with Byeong Man.

526
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:48,873
You're here because you got into a car accident two months ago.

527
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,413
A car accident?

528
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:53,303
You don't remember?

529
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,733
No.

530
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:59,613
You briefly regained consciousness on the day of the accident.

531
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:05,343
We don't know why, but you were in another patient's room and that's where you lost consciousness again.

532
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:09,153
You didn't wake up after that, so we transferred you to the ICU.

533
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,743
You don't remember anything?

534
00:42:15,053 --> 00:42:19,563
- No. 
 - Do you remember your name by chance?

535
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:24,313
We were unable to contact your family because we couldn't identify you.

536
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:26,173
My name is...

537
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:28,803
Tell me anything you remember.

538
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:33,203
I'm not sure.

539
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:34,453
It's all right.

540
00:42:34,453 --> 00:42:38,293
Transient global amnesia is a possible aftereffect of the accident.

541
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:41,133
Your memories will return with time.

542
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:44,783
Are there other aftereffects?

543
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:47,373
Like auditory or visual hallucinations?

544
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,503
Do you have those symptoms?

545
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:56,043
I can hear people's voices,and I can see images I can't identify.

546
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:59,453
It feels like my head is full of fog.

547
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,723
It's hard to explain.

548
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:07,773
Your complete medical examination looks normal.

549
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:14,463
I think it may be a temporary aftereffect of the accident.

550
00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:16,723
It'll gradually get better, so don't worry.

551
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:20,913
Just eat well and feel at ease for now.

552
00:43:20,913 --> 00:43:23,913
Okay. Thank you.

553
00:43:42,813 --> 00:43:48,063
   

554
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:01,183
 Help me! 

555
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,043
 Please help! 

556
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:05,763
 A person is dying here! 

557
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:09,723
 Bring him back to life! Bring him back! 

558
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:11,353
 It's too late. 

559
00:44:11,353 --> 00:44:13,773
 Can't you do something? 

560
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,150
 Gosh! 

561
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,420
   

562
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:50,863
Wow.

563
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:59,023
This is awesome!

564
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:06,183
Yes, this is Yook Dong Joo.

565
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,033
Yes, yes.

566
00:45:09,593 --> 00:45:11,273
Yes...

567
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,613
 You need to come to the hospital. 

568
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,153
 The patient just regained consciousness. 

569
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:41,443
   

570
00:45:44,853 --> 00:45:47,293
I can't go because something urgent came up.

571
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:50,313
Please tell Myeong Seok I'm sorry.

572
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:52,033
An interview?

573
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:55,903
What interview? The book was just published.

574
00:45:55,903 --> 00:45:59,133
I don't care if it's a major newspaper. I don't like interviews.

575
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:02,723
CEO Lee especially arranged this opportunity just for you.

576
00:46:02,723 --> 00:46:05,553
Do you prefer a mysterious concept?

577
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,193
Please hold.

578
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:13,553
Our contract clearly states that you must actively engage in the promotion.

579
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:16,403
It's in two days at 2:00 p.m., so don't be late.

580
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:19,653
Geez...

581
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:22,313
They're driving me nuts.

582
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,600
   

583
00:46:30,603 --> 00:46:33,583
The patient's condition improved significantly, so we moved him to a room.

584
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,403
I see.

585
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:39,503
Excuse me. What about his memories?

586
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:41,453
Did his memories return?

587
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:44,433
Oh, yes. He'll get better gradually.

588
00:47:44,063 --> 00:47:45,863
Excuse me...

589
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:52,083
What the?

590
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,113
What just happened?

591
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:10,723
   
   

592
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,903
Oh, my gosh.

593
00:48:32,903 --> 00:48:34,553
Who are you?

594
00:48:38,623 --> 00:48:40,963
You're Seon Ae. Right?

595
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:43,833
Yes, I am.

596
00:48:50,963 --> 00:48:53,673
Grandma asked me for a favor.

597
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:56,593
She said she must tell you something.

598
00:48:56,593 --> 00:48:57,833
Sorry?

599
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,783
What are you saying right now?

600
00:49:02,783 --> 00:49:04,153
There's no time.

601
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:07,333
A-Are you crazy?

602
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:08,833
Please leave.

603
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:11,293
- Leave! 
 - Who the hell are you?

604
00:49:11,913 --> 00:49:14,343
What are you doing here?

605
00:49:33,963 --> 00:49:35,493
We don't have time.

606
00:49:35,493 --> 00:49:37,443
Grandma's going to pass away soon.

607
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:39,503
Who in the world are you?

608
00:49:39,503 --> 00:49:41,883
Why are you doing this to me?

609
00:49:43,493 --> 00:49:46,123
She wants you to stop feeling sorry.

610
00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:50,203
She said she knows you had...

611
00:49:51,543 --> 00:49:53,293
no other choice.

612
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:56,033
Get out.

613
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:07,143
She said she understands everything.

614
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:11,533
She doesn't want you to feel guilty.

615
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:14,083
Don't be worried sick...

616
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:16,283
or be anxious.

617
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:20,613
- Just be happy. 
   - Just be happy. 

618
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:26,393
 I was fine at the nursing home, too. 

619
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:30,013
 I didn't end up sick because you sent me there, 

620
00:50:30,013 --> 00:50:35,043
 so don't feel bad or heartbroken. 

621
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:43,143
 Thanks for visiting me often when you were busy with your own life. 

622
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:45,953
 I'm sorry for making you suffer. 

623
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:50,573
 I'm sorry you were born into our penniless family. 

624
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:53,993
 I couldn't support you like I supported your brothers. 

625
00:50:53,993 --> 00:51:00,173
 I'm really sorry, and I'm ashamed for having you suffer. 

626
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:03,413
 My kindhearted daughter, Seon Ae. 

627
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:05,093
 Thank you. 

628
00:51:05,093 --> 00:51:07,533
 Thank you so much. 

629
00:51:14,923 --> 00:51:17,833
If you take out the second drawer of the chest,

630
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:20,513
there's an envelope with money on the bottom.

631
00:51:21,493 --> 00:51:24,943
She wants you to use that for your knee surgery

632
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:27,733
and buy yourself a pretty outfit with the rest.

633
00:51:34,183 --> 00:51:40,263
Your eldest brother swindled the family and won't change,so just cut ties with him.

634
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:47,933
I'll leave now.

635
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:02,103
Hey, wait—

636
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,243
Excuse me, well...

637
00:52:31,243 --> 00:52:35,273
What was all that about the grandma just now?

638
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:37,873
And what happened to that man?

639
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:44,153
I was certain someone was under the covers earlier, but he suddenly—

640
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:47,833
Whoa! I don't even know what I'm saying.

641
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:51,843
Y-You're able to walk around like this?

642
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,923
Who are you?

643
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:59,383
You see, I'm...

644
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:00,803
the perpetrator.

645
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:04,603
I'm the one who caused your accident.

646
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,233
I see.

647
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:08,863
Please allow me to apologize first.

648
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:13,523
And it's a huge relief you were able to wake up like a miracle.

649
00:53:20,943 --> 00:53:23,233
W-What are you doing?

650
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,953
It works on some people and doesn't on others.

651
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:29,103
What—

652
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:31,383
W-What does?

653
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:34,813
Why did you suddenly drop the honorifics? You're the perpetrator.

654
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:39,173
Well, I am the perpetrator,but I'm much older than you.

655
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:40,983
You know how old I am?

656
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:47,623
No, I don't. But I do know you're a minor who didn't even register your fingerprints.

657
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:50,983
Anyhow...

658
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:54,263
you don't remember anything?

659
00:53:54,263 --> 00:54:00,643
Your name, school, parents' names, etcetera?

660
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:03,283
N-Nothing?

661
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:35,543
 Mom! 

662
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:56,173
How did you know?

663
00:54:57,523 --> 00:55:01,083
How did you know that grandma was going to pass away?

664
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:06,173
Did that grandma really... tell you all that?

665
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:10,053
Where's the bag?

666
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:14,683
My bag.

667
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:17,563
Where is it?

668
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:33,583
   

669
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:37,033
♫  Shout out loud  ♫

670
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,903
♫  On your two faces covered by darkness  ♫

671
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:45,583
♫  Venom  ♫

672
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:49,563
♫  Those hypocrisies  ♫

673
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:52,423
   

674
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:54,003
 Your memories are back? 

675
00:55:54,003 --> 00:55:56,003
 Do you have the bag, Hyung? Did you look inside? 

676
00:55:56,003 --> 00:55:58,473
 I know no words can justify my actions. 

677
00:55:58,473 --> 00:55:59,733
 I was being chased. 

678
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:01,663
 Up to what point do you remember? 

679
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:03,603
 Looking at the bag might jog my memory. 

680
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:04,943
 Is it at your place right now? 

681
00:56:04,943 --> 00:56:06,943
 You've done something very dangerous. 

682
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:09,523
 This novel wasn't meant to be revealed to the world.  
    

683
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:12,163
 The culprit of both cases might be the same person. 

684
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:15,133
 Everything Detective Park said came out in the novel. 

685
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:17,803
 How the hell did you do that? What's your identity? 

686
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:20,833
 I also want to know who I am and what happened. 

687
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,333
 I'm anxious and have a bad feeling. 

688
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,543
 I'm scared I might hurt someone. 

689
00:56:25,543 --> 00:56:27,723
 I must've become a monster. 

690
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:30,693
 Meet me. Let's meet and talk. 

691
