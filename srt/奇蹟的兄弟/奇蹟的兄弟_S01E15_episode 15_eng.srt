1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:04,797
Swift and accurate, delivering the hottest news.

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,967
This is News Head.

3
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:12,647
Today's head interview guest is Yook Dong Joo, the novelist who won

4
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:18,377
the Korean Literature Award for his novel "God Is Dead."

5
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,997
- Hello.
 - Yes, hello.

6
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:25,987
   

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:37,720


8
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:41,617
Oh, you're awake.

9
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:44,757
Are you okay?

10
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:48,777
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:51,207
Dong Joo contacted me.

12
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,297
He said you fainted last night.

13
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,787
You don't remember?

14
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,277
I was out an entire day?

15
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:07,817
Dong Joo asked me to stay by your side because he was worried about you being alone.

16
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,947
Where did Hyung go?

17
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,887
I heard there's a special reason you're here today.

18
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:16,757
Can you tell us the reason in detail?

19
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,267
First,

20
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:29,207
I'd appreciate it if you could watch the video I brought with me.

21
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,347
Oh, shall we?

22
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:35,977
All right, let's watch the video first.

23
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,457
 Step on him! 

24
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:47,417
 Hey, move, move, move! 

25
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:54,087
 What you're watching right now is a recording of the 

26
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:59,827
 murder of a homeless man from the 1995 Lake Sopyeong incident. 

27
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:03,667
 Are you saying it's a video of the actual murder? 

28
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,657
 That's correct. 

29
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:11,487
At the time, they were 19-year-old high school students.

30
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:15,497
Do you know their identities?

31
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,317
Yes.

32
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,567
Chairman Lee Tae Man of Tae Kang Group,

33
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:26,227
Inspector General Choi Jong Nam from the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office,

34
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:31,337
Hanguk University Professor Na Sang Woo, who's currently reported missing,

35
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:35,807
and movie director Shin Kyeong Cheol, who died recently.

36
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,987
It's those four people.

37
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,687
These people are the real culprits...

38
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:49,067
of the Lake Sopyeong murder from 27 years ago.

39
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:54,297
 Are you speaking of confirmed facts? 

40
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:55,667
 Yes. 

41
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:59,697
 The identities of the four people who killed the homeless man 

42
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:03,897
 in a group assault can be immediately identified if you look at the 

43
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,467
 1996 graduation album of Tae Kang High School. 

44
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:10,067
What a pain in the neck.

45
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:15,107
 It's a very harrowing scene to report without filtering. 

46
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,727
 Although viewers have a right to know, 

47
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:23,537
 in order to shield an unspecified number of universal viewers, 

48
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,167
 we'll have to stop the video here. 

49
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,297
Please turn off the screen for now.

50
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:37,467
Not just the video but the identity of the perpetrators is very shocking as well.

51
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:42,787
Please briefly tell us how you obtained this video

52
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:47,287
and why you decided to report it.

53
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:48,747
Sure.

54
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:54,947
First of all, this video was left in the form of an old videotape,

55
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,157
and I recently found it in my father's keepsakes.

56
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:04,887
And I believed it was my father's dying wish to reveal the truth to the world

57
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:09,487
about the murder that had been covered up for 27 years.

58
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:19,297
Ms. Cha!

59
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:28,247
What are you doing here? I looked everywhere for you.

60
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:30,547
Why did you look for me?

61
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:40,427
I heard you met Dong Joo this afternoon.

62
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:44,207
Yeah.

63
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:47,387
Did he tell you everything?

64
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:49,817
Yeah.

65
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:57,127
Dong Joo asked me to escort you home.

66
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,647
He must be very worried about you.

67
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,507
Why is he worried about me?

68
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,357
He's the one who must be suffering.

69
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:16,557
 Do you know how your father ended up with the videotape of the murder? 

70
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:21,317
In the video I showed you earlier, there are four perpetrators, a victim,

71
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:26,927
and a male student who gets assaulted while trying to stop the assault.

72
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:31,537
 The boy obtained that videotape to reveal the truth, 

73
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:34,097
 and told the detective the truth, 

74
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:37,047
 but that just put him in a more dangerous situation. 

75
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:42,867
 I think he left the videotape with my father in the process. 

76
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,787
 I don't understand. 

77
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:49,977
Why was the student who reported the murder to the police put in a dangerous situation?

78
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:57,377
The real culprits of the Lake Sopyeong murder are the sons of so-called well-off families with wealth and power.

79
00:05:57,377 --> 00:06:01,377
Upon receiving the report, the detective received money from their parents

80
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:08,347
and framed Noh Myeong Nam as the perpetrator, who was actually a witness, and thoroughly covered up the case.

81
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:14,137
 Not only that, but he also killed or attempted to kill people who knew the truth. 

82
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:18,807
 Of course, it must've been by the orders of someone who wanted to hide the truth. 

83
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:21,657
 So you're saying there were more murders? 

84
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,337
 That's right. 

85
00:06:23,337 --> 00:06:30,907
 But I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about that here. 

86
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:35,537
 It's something the police should find out through investigation? 

87
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:36,447
 Yes. 

88
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:42,727
Can you reveal the detective's identity who tried to cover up the Lake Sopyeong incident?

89
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:46,427
It's Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il.

90
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,987
Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il?

91
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,897
That's right.

92
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,260
Ah...

93
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,457
Let me summarize everything.

94
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,757
   

95
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,167
   

96
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:16,667
   

97
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,257
 That's right. 

98
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:36,187
 Coincidentally, Director Shin Kyeong Cheol and Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il, 

99
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,247
 who were involved in the Lake Sopyeong incident were murdered. 

100
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:42,057
 Professor Na Sang Woo is also currently missing. 

101
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,717
 The timing of the incidents are all different. 

102
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:51,457
 Are they possibly related to the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago? 

103
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:56,047
I don't think it's my place to answer that.

104
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,857
I understand.

105
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:07,787
I heard your novel "God is Dead" contains the whole story of the Lake Sopyeong incident.

106
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,607
Is that true?

107
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:15,217
Yes, it's true.

108
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,887
 Recently, your novel, "God Is Dead" 

109
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:23,337
 was reported to have plagiarized a scenario written by the late Director Shin Kyeong Cheol. 

110
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:28,257
 The scenario was also based on the Lake Sopyeong incident, 

111
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,877
 so... is that why the content overlaps to some extent? 

112
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:39,267
Shin Kyeong Cheol is one of the perpetrators, and he is the one who filmed the video I showed you earlier.

113
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:43,087
Because he knew the scene of the incident better than anyone,

114
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,637
his description of the scene can only have been the same.

115
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:54,377
Then, you must've decided to write your novel after watching the video.

116
00:08:54,377 --> 00:09:01,477
No, when I published the novel, I had no knowledge of the Lake Sopyeong incident.

117
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:03,397
I never watched the video, either.

118
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:06,427
You stated earlier that your novel "God is Dead"

119
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:10,667
contained the whole story of the Lake Sopyeong incident.

120
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,247
- That's right. 
  - At the time of the publishing, 

121
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:18,327
 if you had never watched the video nor had any knowledge about the incident, 

122
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,727
 - how did you write the novel containing the whole story  
 - What are you trying to do?

123
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,927
 of the Lake Sopyeong incident? 

124
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,047
"God is Dead"...

125
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,567
wasn't written by me.

126
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:48,727
The original text of the novel was written by the boy you saw earlier in the video...

127
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:53,647
who was a witness to the Lake Sopyeong incident...

128
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:56,897
and tried to tell the truth.

129
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:01,457
I happened to come across that manuscript.

130
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:06,287
And after some minimal edits,

131
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,817
I published...

132
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,747
the book in my name.

133
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,487
 You're saying you published someone else's manuscript in your name? 

134
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,787
 Yes, that's correct. 

135
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,377
 I see. 

136
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,757
What a shame.

137
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,417
This is going to take a toll on your writing career.

138
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:35,977
What made you decide to confess this?

139
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,227
Well...

140
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,747
The truth of the Lake Sopyeong incident...

141
00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:03,617
should not be denied or distorted in the slightest...

142
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,387
by my shameful and wrong actions.

143
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,787
I have cheated and deceived...

144
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,977
countless people and readers.

145
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:37,007
I'll readily take any blame or punishment.

146
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,157
 Although, what I've done is shameful and I don't deserve to talk about truth, 

147
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,227
 the video you all watched is real and the unwavering truth. 

148
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:04,937
They took people's lives like it was a game and the perpetrators, who even filmed the scene,

149
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:10,527
used their parents' power and wealth to cover up the case. Even now...

150
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:15,977
they live as high-ranking members of society, having inherited their parents' wealth and power.

151
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:20,847
I think the perpetrators' parents are also accomplices.

152
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:28,027
If only one of their parents was a true adult and tried to reveal the truth,

153
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,567
many misfortunes could have been prevented.

154
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,067
Mr. Noh Myeong Nam, who has been unrightfully imprisoned

155
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:42,977
for 25 years as the culprit of the murder of Lake Sopyeong,

156
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:45,797
is currently fighting for his life in a coma.

157
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,967
Although it is very late,

158
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:55,027
I sincerely hope that the police reinvestigation will remove...

159
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,367
Noh Myeong Nam's false murder charge...

160
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,197
 and restore his dignity. 

161
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,387
   

162
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,377
- Yes. 
   - Where are you right now? 

163
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,527
I'm at the broadcasting station.

164
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,847
Writer Yook!

165
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,547
Over here!

166
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,777
Journalists are camped in the underground parking lot as well as in the lobby of the broadcasting station.

167
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,677
I see.

168
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:30,577
I think you should have someone else pick up your car tomorrow.

169
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,167
Sure.

170
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,620
   

171
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,180
   

172
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,740
   

173
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:54,867
   

174
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,527
You've become the hottest person in Korea.

175
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,817
You're right.

176
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,677
How is Brother doing?

177
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,867
What about the legal team's response?

178
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,087
Please convene the legal team. I'll head to headquarters now.

179
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,150
   

180
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:36,937
   

181
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,537
Hey, Yong Dae.

182
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,137
Your mother wanted to be alone, so I left first.

183
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,437
Yeah, at the park.

184
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,937
It was a good idea you spoke to her first.

185
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:55,767
Maybe it's because she already knew. She was calmer than I anticipated.

186
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,157
She's just worried about you.

187
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,927
Are you okay?

188
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,707
Yeah.

189
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:09,147
This, too, shall pass.

190
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,397
I'm proud of you, my friend!

191
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,797
Thank goodness the journalists didn't follow us all the way here.

192
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,887
Thank you.

193
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:40,967
I should be thanking you.

194
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,627
You already broadcast it live across the whole country, so the police only have to keep straight ahead.

195
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:51,967
The prosecution will have no choice but to request an arrest warrant right away.

196
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,200
That's great.

197
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,580
You laid out the road for us.

198
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,357
Oh, right.

199
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,957
This is the original videotape and a USB containing the original recording.

200
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,037
Thank you.

201
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:19,277
From here on out, it's all on you, detectives.

202
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:20,640
Please take good care of this.

203
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,420
Don't worry.

204
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,137
We'll put the trash where it belongs.

205
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,377
But it's going to be hard on you from now on. What can we do?

206
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,547
I've braced myself.

207
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:48,137
For your information, the original author of the novel hasn't come forward yet.

208
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:51,887
And the book wasn't published exactly the same as the original but revised,

209
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:56,447
so I think the copyright law could determine the plagiarism dispute.

210
00:17:56,447 --> 00:18:01,557
But that's not a legal problem as long as the original author doesn't initiate a plagiarism dispute.

211
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,157
It's a matter of conscience.

212
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:09,377
You're right. It is a matter of conscience.

213
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,887
You confessed your mistake on live broadcast, so the entire country knows.

214
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:21,847
I think you deserve a clear conscience.

215
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:28,827
Not just anyone can be brave and admit and confess their mistakes like you did.

216
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,087
You're incredible.

217
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,247
I'm being sincere.

218
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,817
The aftermath will be tough, but you'll overcome it.

219
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:44,777
I can't wait for your next novel.

220
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:47,877
You'll write great content for sure.

221
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,647
Hang in there.

222
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,437
Okay.

223
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,597
Are you okay?

224
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,667
When did you wake up? Does your head hurt?

225
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,387
One question at a time.

226
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,160
Are you okay?

227
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm fine.

228
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,847
Does someone who's fine just faint?

229
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,977
Let's go to the hospital first thing tomorrow.

230
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,187
Dr. Lee Soo Yeon wants to perform a checkup.

231
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:43,037
You didn't have dinner yet. Right?

232
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:44,147
Yeah.

233
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,297
I didn't eat yet, so I could eat with you.

234
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:48,157
You're probably hungry. You should've eaten first.

235
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:50,537
It's unappetizing to eat alone.

236
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:54,577
Woo Jeong made some abalone porridge. Let's go in and eat rice.

237
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,757
- You said it's porridge, not rice. 
 - Gosh.

238
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:01,397
- Let's go inside. 
 - Sure.

239
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:29,557
The arrest warrants for Lee Tae Man and Choi Jong Nam have been issued!

240
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:36,947
What's with your expressions?

241
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:40,507
Chairman Lee Tae Man's team just called and said he'll appear voluntarily.

242
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,507
Appear voluntarily?

243
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:47,867
I think someone on the prosecution informed Tae Kang before the arrest warrant was issued.

244
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,937
We have to bring him in cuffs.

245
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:52,237
The entire country needs to see him in cuffs!

246
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:54,767
They said he left 10 minutes ago.

247
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,237
Let's go.

248
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:57,717
He'll be here any second now.

249
00:20:57,717 --> 00:21:01,077
We should welcome him since he's appearing voluntarily.

250
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:13,197
 The true culprits of the Lake Sopyeong murder have been revealed after 27 years. 

251
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:17,927
 Writer Yook Dong Joo released a video found in his father's keepsakes 

252
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:23,267
 and revealed the truth behind the Lake Sopyeong murder, which had been covered up for 27 years. 

253
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,897
 The footage, taken with a home video camera, 

254
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:28,817
 shows the devastating murder scene at the time, 

255
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:34,497
 as well as the faces of the culprits, clear enough to be identified with the naked eye. 

256
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:38,697
 The culprits in the video were 19-year-old high school students at the time 

257
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,637
 and are now reigning as leaders of our society. 

258
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:44,357
 They're no other than Tae Kang Group's Chairman, Lee Tae Man, 

259
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:46,017
 Seoul District Prosecutors' Office Inspector General, Choi Jong Nam, 

260
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:48,037
 the late movie director, Shin Kyeong Cheol, 

261
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:50,667
 and former Hanguk University professor, Na Sang Woo. 

262
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,687
 In order to cover up their crimes, 

263
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,757
 they bribed the late Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il, 

264
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:59,167
 who was in charge of the case at the time and created a false culprit. 

265
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,877
 Noh Myeong Nam, who was imprisoned for 25 years because of them, 

266
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:07,657
 is currently regretfully unconscious. 

267
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:13,857
♫  Oh, look! Too late to save you  ♫

268
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:16,357
♫  I know you want me to hate you  ♫

269
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:18,897
 Once their past crimes were revealed, 

270
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:22,097
 Tae Kang's Chairman, Lee Tae Man, and Inspector General Choi Jong Nam 

271
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:26,757
 each expressed their willingness to appear voluntarily, saying they'd diligently undergo investigation 

272
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:28,917
 regarding past cases through their lawyers. 

273
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,787
Let's go, Lee Tae Man.

274
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:33,007
 While some legal experts interpret that 

275
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:36,297
 punishment will be difficult due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. 

276
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:38,367
 But civic groups, including public opinion, 

277
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:42,217
 criticize that there's "One law for the rich and another for the poor." 

278
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:44,507
 Meanwhile, according to a police official, 

279
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:48,367
 the investigation will also focus on the late Director Shin, 

280
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,767
 identified as an accomplice, Na Sang Woo, a former professor at Hanguk University, 

281
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:56,077
 who is currently missing, and the late Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il, 

282
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:59,187
 who covered up their crimes. 

283
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:03,187
♫  Shout out louder  ♫

284
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:06,517
♫  Light up the darkness  ♫

285
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:10,277
♫  Until the morning comes, get away  ♫

286
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:14,767
As a prosecutor of the Republic of Korea who should protect and enforce the law,

287
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:21,967
I am very sorry for causing deep disappointment and concern to the people.

288
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:27,387
It is a shame to hear some distorted and exaggerated reports,

289
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:30,027
but it's all due to my shortcomings.

290
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:33,557
I'll do my best to undergo the police investigation.

291
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:39,360
Once again, I am very sorry for causing concern to the people.

292
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,587
If you have something to say, say it.

293
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:54,007
Huh?

294
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:57,777
Stop glancing at me like that and spit it out.

295
00:23:58,977 --> 00:24:02,137
What will happen to Dong Joo now?

296
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:04,077
What do you mean?

297
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:07,697
Will he end up going to prison?

298
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,357
Apparently, that won't happen.

299
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:12,717
But stealing someone else's work is theft.

300
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:18,987
I'm just worried.

301
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:21,727
Sorry, it was my mistake.

302
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:25,957
What are you sorry about? You're right.

303
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:30,007
Yong Dae explained it to me, but I can't explain it.

304
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:32,577
Ultimately, he won't be arrested or anything.

305
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:35,157
That's a relief.

306
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:43,977
But what will Dong Joo do now that he can't write?

307
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,097
Why can't he write?

308
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:50,027
Maybe as a hobby, but who would accept him?

309
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:54,007
Everyone in Korea knows what Dong Joo did.

310
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,897
What's wrong?

311
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:06,717
Young Sook!

312
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,637
Find someone new.

313
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,407
What are you saying all of a sudden?

314
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,770
My goodness!

315
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,847
Did I say something wrong?

316
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:23,527
Our publishing company trusted Writer Yook Dong Joo

317
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:28,887
and we never imagined something so disgraceful would happen.

318
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:34,257
We're also in a state of confusion and shock.

319
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:37,827
We'll announce future plans as soon as

320
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:43,727
we have a detailed plan on how to resolve this problem.

321
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:50,967
Above all, I am very sorry this incident caused great disappointment and concern

322
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:56,577
to many readers who love Korean literature.

323
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:27,517
Please tell us about the situation at the time.

324
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,897
Whatever you remember.

325
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:33,707
He repeatedly told you he doesn't remember.

326
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:36,637
You said you were drunk.

327
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,937
Did you take drugs, too?

328
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:42,097
- Hallucinogens or illegal— 
 - That never happened.

329
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:47,677
You said you don't remember a thing, so how can you be so sure?

330
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:52,737
Don't go too far.

331
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,420
- Why did you kill the victim? 
 - I said I didn't kill him.

332
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,330
Did you hit the victim's head with a rock?

333
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:02,837
Can you not differentiate between a novel and reality?

334
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:04,547
Chairman Lee.

335
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:08,617
That's what's written in the novel.

336
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:13,567
Take another good look at the video.

337
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:19,517
As you've seen in the video, there's only a group assault scene against the victim.

338
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:23,797
There's no scene where my client directly kills the victim.

339
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:27,217
And the people who threw the victim into the lake are

340
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:31,547
Inspector General Choi Jong Nam and Professor Na Sang Woo.

341
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:43,287
I don't remember clearly,

342
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:49,097
but what I can tell you for sure is that I was involved in the assault,

343
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:51,647
but I never committed murder.

344
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:57,127
Wasn't it you who threw the victim into the lake?

345
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,387
Na Sang Woo. Choi Jong Nam.

346
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:05,857
The video shows you two throwing the victim into the lake.

347
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:15,947
Why did you kill him?

348
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:18,147
He was already dead by then.

349
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:21,597
Does that mean you threw him into the lake after he died?

350
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,647
I thought he was dead.

351
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,467
Answer clearly.

352
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:31,187
Are you saying he was dead or you mistook him for dead?

353
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:39,397
Let me change my question.

354
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:42,497
Who killed the victim?

355
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:46,007
It happened 27 years ago. How can I remember everything?

356
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:50,357
Does it make sense you can't remember killing someone?

357
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:53,457
- Who said I killed anyone? 
 - Then who killed him?

358
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:55,367
Was it Lee Tae Man?

359
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,607
Lee Tae Man is strongly denying the murder!

360
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:03,617
If you don't answer now, we have no choice but to conclude based on the video.

361
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:20,247
Now that I think about it, when we threw him into the lake, he was already dead.

362
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:22,407
Are you certain?

363
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,947
I'm certain.

364
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,387
Who killed him?

365
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:30,227
How frustrating.

366
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,797
You'll know if you watch the video carefully.

367
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:36,147
Carefully, how?

368
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:40,127
Something happened when the victim wasn't in the frame.

369
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:45,477
In other words, if you find the person who was not in the frame with the victim,

370
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,137
you'll get your answer.

371
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,827
I'll return this to you.

372
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:12,697
Weren't you planning to expose this on the broadcast, too?

373
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,400
I was going to, but...

374
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,290
   

375
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,257
- I changed my mind. 
 - Why?

376
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:23,747
I figured you needed this insurance more than I did.

377
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,157
What do you mean?

378
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:32,827
If I expose this, you'd be put in a tight spot.

379
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:40,077
You might be accused of being Lee Tae Man's accomplice who manages his secret ledgers.

380
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:43,407
Are you returning this to me for my sake?

381
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,587
There are two reasons.

382
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:52,887
One is... if I had exposed Lee Tae Man's secret ledgers today,

383
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:56,087
the Lake Sopyeong incident would've been buried.

384
00:30:56,967 --> 00:31:01,757
The secret ledger would've been blown into a bigger issue.

385
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:04,257
And?

386
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:08,707
I thought it would be better to leave it up to your choice.

387
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,737
What do you mean, my choice?

388
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:17,567
If you... personally hand the USB to the police,

389
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:21,027
the situation will be very different.

390
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:26,857
You'll be the informant, not an accomplice.

391
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:34,627
But whatever your decision, your safety is a priority.

392
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:37,387
Don't do anything dangerous.

393
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:45,797
That's... probably what Ha Neul wants.

394
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:54,287
I should get going.

395
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,817
That videotape...

396
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:08,807
I'm the one who stole it from Kyeong Cheol's house.

397
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:19,757
Ha Neul... tried to tell the police what happened at Lake Sopyeong.

398
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:25,577
However, I didn't have the courage to speak up with him.

399
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:35,147
Since I was well aware of the power they held and how ruthless they could be.

400
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:40,237
Furthermore, Ha Neul was an orphan.

401
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:44,867
The only weapon Ha Neul held was the truth.

402
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:50,067
I thought he'd be fighting a losing battle with that.

403
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:54,627
However, if there was evidence,

404
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:58,827
I believed he had a chance of winning.

405
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,207
So...

406
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:08,717
I stole the videotape and gave it to Ha Neul.

407
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:19,957
If I hadn't... given the videotape to Ha Neul back then,

408
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:27,197
Ha Neul might've been able to put that day behind him and live a normal life.

409
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:30,927
And...

410
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:40,807
your father wouldn't have passed away like that, either.

411
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:51,587
Even if the situation changes, people don't change.

412
00:33:53,797 --> 00:34:00,420
Even without the videotape, Ha Neul would've acted the same.

413
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:07,960
And my father... would've still helped Ha Neul.

414
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:10,797
I'm sure he would've.

415
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:15,417
The part you told me about is missing from the novel.

416
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:22,827
I don't know if that's why, but when I first read Ha Neul's manuscript,

417
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:30,997
I thought there was a subtle gap even though his writing was so good.

418
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:37,217
I think... Ha Neul's desire

419
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:43,957
to protect you... was filled with that gap.

420
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,757
Let me ask you one last question.

421
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:19,267
Why did you meet with the missing Professor Na Sang Woo that day?

422
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:28,757
   

423
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:34,987
 When I think about that day, I feel so miserable. 

424
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:38,747
 So miserable that I can't live. 

425
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:44,457
 I have nightmares even with my eyes open. 

426
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:48,807
 Just pray to your God for forgiveness. 

427
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:54,007
 You said... he'll forgive everything if you do. 

428
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:58,377
 Do you have a conscience? 

429
00:35:58,377 --> 00:36:01,457
 Don't you feel anything? 

430
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:03,757
 You've never regretted that day? 

431
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:07,807
 I only look ahead. The past is behind me. 

432
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:11,177
 You murdering son of a bitch. 

433
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:14,557
 There was no need to kill him! 

434
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:18,587
 - Are you crazy? 
 - I'm different from you. 

435
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:24,367
 I'm human! I'm intelligent. 

436
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:27,007
 You're barbaric. 

437
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:30,897
 This is why I don't like intelligent people. 

438
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:37,997
 Barbarians are more human than hypocrites who pretend to be just with mere words. 

439
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:42,747
 Fine, I'll show you. 

440
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:47,067
 What it means to act according to your conscience. 

441
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:52,617
 I'm going to confess everything. 

442
00:36:52,617 --> 00:36:58,567
 I'm going to confess everything and ask for forgiveness. 

443
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,457
 Go ahead. 

444
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,367
 You're Satan. 

445
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:09,857
 Lee Tae Man, you're Satan! 

446
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:12,157
 You should go now. 

447
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:18,187
 This is why your own father doesn't like you. 

448
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:23,647
 Your father liked Ha Neul. 

449
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:26,227
 You know that, too. 

450
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:29,787
 He always complimented Ha Neul in front of us. 

451
00:37:31,507 --> 00:37:34,357
 Oh, I see. 

452
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:39,057
 That's why you killed Ha Neul, didn't you? 

453
00:37:40,497 --> 00:37:47,907
 The greatest... mistake of my life was meeting you. 

454
00:37:50,147 --> 00:37:54,267
 You ignorant, macho piece of trash. 

455
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:57,127
 You're not even human. 

456
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:17,087
 Tae Man, don't kill me. 

457
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:38,267
According to Byeon Jong Il's testimony, on the day of Professor Na's disappearance,

458
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:43,607
they met in front of your office, and he said he came to see you.

459
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,937
- I don't remember. 
 - Assemblyman Byeon's testimony

460
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:52,547
is a false confession by intimidation and has no effect as evidence.

461
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:55,207
Did you decide to kill him after watching that video?

462
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:59,117
- You've gone too far. 
 - Allow me to correct myself.

463
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:05,677
Did you arrange... Byeong Jong Il's murder?

464
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,767
- Excuse me! 
 - No, it's fine.

465
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:14,147
You got to do your performance in front of the journalists.

466
00:39:14,147 --> 00:39:17,007
And I even posed for the pictures.

467
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:21,377
Wasn't that enough to save the police's face?

468
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:27,107
Let's stop this cliché exchange and call it a day.

469
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,977
That's right.

470
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:09,287
You're saying Lee Tae Man struck the victim's head with a rock. Right?

471
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:10,507
Yes.

472
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:12,857
Did you witness it yourself?

473
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:15,557
I saw it with my own eyes.

474
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:20,427
So, Choi Jong Nam and Na Sang Woo threw the dead body into the lake?

475
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:26,077
 Why is he so heavy? 

476
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,387
Yes.

477
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:42,267
Please tell me if you suspect anything regarding the Assemblyman Byeon and Professor Na cases.

478
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:43,487
Not sure.

479
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:48,137
To be honest, we've got circumstantial evidence but lack the physical proof.

480
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:55,817
Professor Na always regretted what he did in the past.

481
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:58,887
He used to say that whenever he got drunk.

482
00:40:58,887 --> 00:41:02,187
Chairman Lee Tae Man must've disliked that.

483
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:05,067
- He did. 
 - When Assemblyman Byeon was kidnapped,

484
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:08,787
did the kidnapper send his confession video to Lee Tae Man?

485
00:41:08,787 --> 00:41:10,237
Yes.

486
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:13,077
Inspector General Choi and I saw it, too.

487
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:18,127
Do you think there's a possibility Chairman Lee killed Byeon Jong Il because of that?

488
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,177
Yes.

489
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:26,567
Thank you.

490
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:31,267
Thank you for coming in person. We were going to contact you anyway.

491
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:32,647
Not at all.

492
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:35,457
Also, take this.

493
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,987
What's in there?

494
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:44,857
A secret ledger containing Chairman Lee's lobbying activity.

495
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:50,487
Take it.

496
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:02,577
All transactions were done in cash.

497
00:42:02,577 --> 00:42:05,967
- Did you witness them yourself? 
 - Yes.

498
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:10,297
But they're powerful enough to silence my testimony with ease.

499
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:14,377
You'll need thorough preparation.

500
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:18,897
The political arena, the justice system, and the press.

501
00:42:18,897 --> 00:42:22,307
People you have to face are quite strong.

502
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,277
I understand what you mean.

503
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:27,047
We'll contact you after checking.

504
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:29,877
I'll be going now.

505
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:41,957
The group's reputation plummeted, and the boycott movement is spreading.

506
00:42:41,957 --> 00:42:45,357
The chairman's apology alone won't solve this.

507
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,187
We need to take action as a group that people will accept—

508
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:50,637
What are you saying right now?

509
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:53,557
Are you saying the chairman should resign or something?

510
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:57,037
I'll tell you something.

511
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:04,537
I think it'll be better to discuss the matter of resignation at an emergency board meeting.

512
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:09,707
The problem at hand is changing the public opinion.

513
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:12,717
Even if Brother apologizes nationally and resigns,

514
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:17,007
our reputation will continue to fall until public opinion changes.

515
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:19,447
Is there a way out of this?

516
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:24,747
What do you think people were most outraged by?

517
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,007
People these days become extremely angry when someone cheats and

518
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:35,557
easily achieves something they worked so hard for.

519
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:40,657
That's what we need to focus on.

520
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:43,897
With the media at the center, we must use all means to

521
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:48,357
shift the people's focus to something other than the Lake Sopyeong case.

522
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:50,687
Redirect it elsewhere?

523
00:44:12,587 --> 00:44:16,497
The police announced at their investigations briefing that Chairman Lee Tae Man of Tae Kang Group

524
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:20,767
and Inspector General Choi Jong Nam of the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office returned home

525
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:22,677
after interrogations about the Lake Sopyeong incident.

526
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:25,497
In a few moments, Chairman Lee Tae Man will give a national apology

527
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:28,377
here at Tae Kang Group Convention Center.

528
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:30,137
   

529
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:39,717
I'm Chairman Lee Tae Man of Tae Kang Group.

530
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:48,537
I'm deeply sorry and regretful for disappointing and causing concern for the people

531
00:44:48,537 --> 00:44:51,807
with my unfortunate behavior.

532
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,960
   

533
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,950
   

534
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:13,947
I, Lee Tae Man, am resigning from Tae Kang Group's managing positions.

535
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:20,527
I'll only reflect on myself from now on, spending time to atone for my sins.

536
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:26,007
To everyone who suffered because of my past mistakes,

537
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:31,237
I'll do everything within my power to apologize and repent.

538
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:36,207
Also, I won't stop at repenting for my past mistake

539
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:44,297
and open up a better future through self-reflection and strict self-discipline.

540
00:45:44,297 --> 00:45:46,157
   

541
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:51,217
 Chairman Lee Tae Man of Tae Kang Group announced he'd resign from managing positions, 

542
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:55,087
 along with repeated messages of apology. 

543
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,827
 In response, Tae Kang Group held an emergency board meeting 

544
00:45:57,827 --> 00:46:01,657
 to make CEO Lee of Literature and Imagination as acting chairman. 

545
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,467
 - saying they'll make sure  
 - CEO Lee.

546
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:06,657
 the group will be managed without issues. 

547
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:11,307
 Inspector General Choi Jong Nam, who was found to be 

548
00:46:11,307 --> 00:46:13,587
 an accomplice of the Lake Sopyeong incident 

549
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:16,747
 was released from duty as per the prosecution laws. 

550
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:19,857
I'm going to take a break for a while.

551
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:22,807
Golf? Sounds great.

552
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:25,497
Set up a schedule for me, Attorney Kim.

553
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,577
Hawaii sounds great.

554
00:46:29,477 --> 00:46:32,327
I'll just get to take a break.

555
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:38,787
You should've at least told me before you went and talked about it on TV.

556
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:49,157
How can I tell you in advance when I'm exposing your brother as a murderer?

557
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:54,567
Wow, you're really shameless.

558
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,607
I'm sorry...

559
00:47:02,657 --> 00:47:04,497
about the novel.

560
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,397
I have nothing to say about that.

561
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:12,997
I'll take responsibility...

562
00:47:14,037 --> 00:47:15,847
for whatever I can.

563
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:20,127
Gosh, this is why you should trust your instincts.

564
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:27,657
When I saw the manuscript for "God is Dead" for the first time, I couldn't believe that you wrote it.

565
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:32,377
You're not that good, you know.

566
00:47:35,907 --> 00:47:42,587
But still, I acknowledge you for your confession, although it was late.

567
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:48,487
Although the publishing company and the entire group took some damage because of you,

568
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:55,627
I'll have to cut out the rotten tree and be reborn fresh and new.

569
00:47:57,897 --> 00:48:02,857
Am I supposed to congratulate you on becoming acting chairman?

570
00:48:02,857 --> 00:48:05,987
You should be congratulated.

571
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:09,987
- Why would I be? 
 - Thanks to you, I became the leading general of a war

572
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,057
and now I have tons of things to do.

573
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,557
Why should I be congratulated for that?

574
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:20,887
I became way too busy to take legal action against you regarding the novel.

575
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:28,027
But you should still take responsibility for what is due. Right?

576
00:48:28,027 --> 00:48:31,677
Give back the signing fee for the next work and also

577
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:34,767
take care of the study within this month.

578
00:48:36,477 --> 00:48:38,017
Okay.

579
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,227
Do you even have money to give back to me?

580
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:45,127
That's none of your business.

581
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:47,177
Of course.

582
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:50,857
By the way,

583
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:56,797
can you reach the original writer?

584
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,717
You have taken quite a lot of money in royalties so far.

585
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:08,087
It's a little vague because there's no original writer to give that back to.

586
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,217
Most of the latter parts of the novel were written by you, too.

587
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:13,607
- I don't even know if he's alive. 
 - Really?

588
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:15,087
Yes.

589
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:20,237
How problematic.

590
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:27,847
I'll ask the legal team about how this will go down and let you know.

591
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:34,547
How are you going to make a living from now on?

592
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:40,527
Yook Dong Joo, you are done in this industry.

593
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:45,017
Bankrupt. It's the end for you.

594
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:51,767
You did something very useless.

595
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:54,157
Who do you think is worse off?

596
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,917
You're the only one hitting rock bottom.

597
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:00,097
You can't hide your blood.

598
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:04,287
Starting with your father, Lee Tae Man, and you...

599
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:07,637
are all the same trash.

600
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:11,487
Your cognitive dissonance is bad.

601
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:14,717
You're more trash for stealing someone else's work.

602
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:21,257
I don't care what anyone else says to criticize me, but you should shut your mouth.

603
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,177
What did you say?

604
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:27,697
I'm going to find out who caused my father to die...

605
00:50:28,617 --> 00:50:32,607
and for what reason without fail.

606
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,707
So, just wait.

607
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:51,000
   

608
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,830
   
   

609
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:08,487
   

610
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,687
   

611
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:15,407
   

612
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:18,427
   

613
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,950
   

614
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,530
   
   

615
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:32,437
   

616
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:34,307
   

617
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:35,217
   

618
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,637
   

619
00:51:36,637 --> 00:51:37,467
   

620
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:39,907
   

621
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,290
   

622
00:51:43,257 --> 00:51:46,587
♫  Show you I can't fall now  ♫

623
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:49,827
♫  Cannot tell me to slow down  ♫

624
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:52,887
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

625
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:56,277
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

626
00:51:56,277 --> 00:51:58,547
♫  Can't let you go  ♫

627
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:25,297
Anyone here?

628
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,377
Jeon Chang Geun, are you inside?

629
00:52:33,477 --> 00:52:35,267
   

630
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:41,857
What is it?

631
00:52:42,387 --> 00:52:44,617
Vehicle information.

632
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:52,257
 Since you confess so easily, 

633
00:52:52,257 --> 00:52:55,447
 you would've sold your country if you were tortured, wouldn't you? 

634
00:52:55,447 --> 00:52:57,187
 I don't quite understand... 

635
00:52:57,187 --> 00:53:02,627
 We watched the video of you selling us out to Lee Ha Neul. 

636
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:06,237
 You should've done your job right if you accepted our money. 

637
00:53:06,237 --> 00:53:10,187
 This wouldn't have happened if you got rid of Lee Ha Neul properly back then. 

638
00:53:10,877 --> 00:53:12,467
 Where are you? 

639
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:15,227
 Detective Kim will go to your studio. 

640
00:53:15,227 --> 00:53:17,447
 Keeping him alive will bring calamity. 

641
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,667
 Take care of him on your own. 

642
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,067
   

643
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:36,967
Post this car as "urgently wanted."

644
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:40,407
This car might belong to the suspect who killed Byeon Jong Il.

645
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:43,447
It's highly likely to be a stolen car, but have them look it up for now.

646
00:53:43,447 --> 00:53:45,327
Understood.

647
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:48,957
And this is about Cheetah. He was Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple's believer.

648
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:52,247
It looks like Byeon Jong Il met Cheetah at the temple.

649
00:53:53,407 --> 00:53:54,737
It's me.

650
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:58,547
A group picture of Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple was found in Byeon Jong Il's office.

651
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:00,497
Cheetah was in the picture, too.

652
00:54:00,497 --> 00:54:04,007
Looks like it's a cult gang, not just a cult group.

653
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:06,387
Okay.

654
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:12,077
Check if Byeon Jong Il's clothes and shoes in the evidence storage room were bugged.

655
00:54:12,077 --> 00:54:14,807
I'll explain when I come back. Yes.

656
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:18,947
They didn't let Byeon Jong Il go for no reason.

657
00:54:18,947 --> 00:54:20,327
Yes.

658
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:24,967
It looks like no one's inside, so let's go to Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple first.

659
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:28,557
- Right now? 
 - Cheetah was their believer.

660
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:31,147
Let's meet Ahn Hyeon Mook first.

661
00:54:31,147 --> 00:54:32,537
Okay.

662
00:54:45,257 --> 00:54:47,467
Do you remember me?

663
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:49,527
Yes.

664
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:53,847
We came to ask you a few things about Noh Myeong Nam.

665
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:59,657
- What is it? 
 - Did you happen to meet Noh Myeong Nam on the night of October 5th, two years ago?

666
00:55:02,577 --> 00:55:05,357
I can't really remember that.

667
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:10,187
But he doesn't usually come here at night.

668
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:15,287
Do you happen to remember where you were on September 19th last year?

669
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:16,837
What happened that day?

670
00:55:16,837 --> 00:55:20,007
Director Shin Kyeong Cheol was murdered that day.

671
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:28,697
I was probably home.

672
00:55:28,697 --> 00:55:30,907
Since I usually come home after work.

673
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:33,467
- Were you alone? 
 - Well, I live alone.

674
00:55:33,467 --> 00:55:35,857
You came home early today from work.

675
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:38,737
Because I'm on vacation.

676
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:45,227
- Well, if you're done asking... 
 - Oh, yes.

677
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:48,497
- Thank you for your cooperation. 
 - No problem.

678
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,527
Lee Ha Neul.

679
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,477
My name is Jeon Chang Geun.

680
00:56:05,477 --> 00:56:07,707
That's not it.

681
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:11,507
I just wanted to know if you heard of the name Lee Ha Neul.

682
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:16,217
No, I haven't. Who is it?

683
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:21,807
Never mind.

684
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:24,227
Thank you for your cooperation.

685
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:28,287
Please take care.

686
00:56:36,357 --> 00:56:38,957
Do you think he's Lee Ha Neul?

687
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,217
Not sure.

688
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,047
Why do you keep coming here? Dong Joo's mom isn't here!

689
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,727
Can I interview you at least, Boss?

690
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:01,977
Go away now! You're interrupting my business.

691
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:17,997
   

692
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,347
Hey, it's me, Mom.

693
00:57:28,347 --> 00:57:30,527
 Oh, Dong Joo. 

694
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,437
Where are you?

695
00:57:32,437 --> 00:57:34,337
 Where else could I be? 

696
00:57:34,337 --> 00:57:36,777
 I'm working. 

697
00:57:39,387 --> 00:57:42,417
 Hello? Dong Joo! 

698
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,217
Yes, Mom.

699
00:57:49,387 --> 00:57:51,477
Y-You're doing okay. Right?

700
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:55,137
Of course, I'm doing okay.

701
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:57,877
Don't worry about me.

702
00:57:57,877 --> 00:58:03,237
Even now, the customers at the restaurant and locals are saying you caught the murderers.

703
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:07,317
Saying you did a great thing.

704
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:13,917
Mom.

705
00:58:13,917 --> 00:58:15,537
 Go ahead. 

706
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:28,907
I reserved plane tickets to Canada. It's in three days.

707
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:39,537
I wanted to send you off sooner so you won't have to see this.

708
00:58:41,147 --> 00:58:43,217
But it ended up this way.

709
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:45,397
I'm not going.

710
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:48,917
- I already reserved it. 
 - Cancel it.

711
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:51,567
- Mom. 
 - Yes, I'm your mom.

712
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:56,287
A mom needs to be by her child's side in his hard times. Where would she go?

713
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:05,647
I'm okay.

714
00:59:05,647 --> 00:59:08,417
It's more comfortable for me to have you go.

715
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:15,567
Dong Joo, although I won't be of much help to you,

716
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,937
I'm going to be by my son's side.

717
00:59:18,937 --> 00:59:23,147
Hold your chin up high. You confessed all your wrongdoings.

718
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:27,627
All the murderers were released, but on TV, they only...

719
00:59:35,897 --> 00:59:39,877
They only criticize you on TV. How can they do this?

720
00:59:41,307 --> 00:59:43,187
 Dong Joo, 

721
00:59:43,187 --> 00:59:45,677
 you just need to start again. It's okay. 

722
00:59:45,677 --> 00:59:48,837
You were good at writing since you were young, just like your dad.

723
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:52,097
You always won first place in essay contests, too.

724
00:59:53,707 --> 00:59:55,957
 Did you eat yet? 

725
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:02,207
 Dong Joo. 

726
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:04,557
I'm sorry, Mom.

727
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,437
I'm sorry.

728
01:00:09,727 --> 01:00:15,897
I wanted to be a good son to you. I'm sorry.

729
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,430
Oh, my world...

730
01:00:37,957 --> 01:00:39,567
He's not answering?

731
01:00:41,617 --> 01:00:45,857
He must be too busy since he said he's going to the publishing company.

732
01:00:45,857 --> 01:00:50,057
People are so weird. They must've gone mad.

733
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:51,377
You saw YouTube, huh?

734
01:00:51,377 --> 01:00:53,907
The TV and YouTube are just the same.

735
01:00:53,907 --> 01:00:56,337
They only criticize Dong Joo like a crowd gone mad.

736
01:00:56,337 --> 01:00:58,677
Saying non-existent things as if they're true.

737
01:00:58,677 --> 01:01:00,937
Just ignore them.

738
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:05,297
It must be a reporter or a YouTuber.

739
01:01:06,307 --> 01:01:09,297
These people, I just ought to!

740
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:13,787
Cut it out now!

741
01:01:14,677 --> 01:01:16,377
Who are you?

742
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:19,827
Where do you think you're going?

743
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:23,037
Excuse me, please get out.

744
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:48,177
Why do you have this?

745
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:52,147
Why do you have my sneakers?

746
01:02:09,497 --> 01:02:11,747
Please forgive me.

747
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:15,697
Please forgive me for my sins.

748
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:19,957
I deserve to die.

749
01:02:19,957 --> 01:02:25,217
Please forgive my sins and pardon me.

750
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:34,797
Do you know him?

751
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,417
He doesn't seem normal.

752
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:50,027
Mister.

753
01:03:03,497 --> 01:03:06,537
If you tell me honestly, I'll forgive you.

754
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:12,027
Why do you have this?

755
01:03:12,737 --> 01:03:17,207
I didn't know... Ahn Hyeon Mook was Satan.

756
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:21,307
I thought Ahn Hyeon Mook... was god.

757
01:03:21,947 --> 01:03:23,407
I thought...

758
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:27,327
I was doing God's work.

759
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:34,187
Who's Ahn Hyeon Mook?

760
01:03:42,727 --> 01:03:47,017
Tell me... more in detail.

761
01:03:59,897 --> 01:04:02,007
 What should I do with that young man? 

762
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:04,077
 Bury him without making a mess. 

763
01:04:04,077 --> 01:04:09,417
 The director has himself a great worker of God. 

764
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:22,417
This is an order from Father, so go make sinners

765
01:04:22,417 --> 01:04:26,237
Lee Ha Neul and Lee Kang San repent.

766
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:32,417
Make them repent in Father's name, but punish them in Father's name,

767
01:04:36,467 --> 01:04:39,957
if they don't repent until the end.

768
01:04:44,957 --> 01:04:49,637
Please forgive me! I was wrong!

769
01:04:54,177 --> 01:04:57,907
Please forgive me! It was my mistake!

770
01:04:57,907 --> 01:04:59,357
Please forgive me!

771
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:01,177
Kang San...

772
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:04,857
Please save me!

773
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,757
Kang San...

774
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,757
 What do you see from me? 

775
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:20,337
Eternal life in Heaven!

776
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:22,237
 Eternal life in Heaven! 

777
01:05:22,237 --> 01:05:23,767
Eternal life in Heaven!

778
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:25,447
 Eternal life in Heaven! 

779
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:30,047
A true Cheonyoung believer isn't blinded by filthy money.

780
01:05:30,047 --> 01:05:35,777
Money is Satan, the evil, and crap.

781
01:05:35,777 --> 01:05:42,567
Throw away all of the filthy evil, crap, and Satan at this holy temple of the Father.

782
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:44,437
 Hallelujah! 

783
01:05:44,437 --> 01:05:49,977
If you do that, you can exchange it with a seat of eternal life in Heaven's

784
01:05:49,977 --> 01:05:55,257
Cheongyoung Heavenly Temple, where only Cheonyoung's disciples can enter!

785
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:58,777
 Hallelujah! 

786
01:05:58,777 --> 01:06:02,277
- Do you believe? 
  - We believe! 

787
01:06:02,277 --> 01:06:07,117
All light belongs in Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple, and all darkness remains outside.

788
01:06:07,117 --> 01:06:10,897
There was Father's prophecy, saying this world

789
01:06:10,897 --> 01:06:15,007
is full of sin and is rotting, so it must be recreated.

790
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:16,567
- Father! 
 - Father!

791
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:24,237
Darkness will pass, and a bright new world of Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple will soon come!

792
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:27,487
 Please come! 

793
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:29,447
Right here!

794
01:06:31,757 --> 01:06:38,057
There's a messiah in Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple.

795
01:06:44,497 --> 01:06:46,457
Right before your eyes!

796
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:48,757
Who is it?

797
01:06:48,757 --> 01:06:52,617
 Father, please come! 

798
01:07:13,777 --> 01:07:18,087
 The crazy man went off rattling about Ahn Hyeon Mook being Satan 

799
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:21,247
 and Kang San disappeared all of a sudden. 

800
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:33,437
Today is the day!

801
01:07:33,437 --> 01:07:37,977
Second Advent Jesus has come to this place as I prophesied!

802
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:43,447
 - Father! 
 - I believe! 

803
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:45,207
My son!

804
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:49,507
Come to Father!

805
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,647
I have been waiting for you!

806
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:59,597
For this day of your reincarnation, this Father has been waiting for a long time!

807
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:04,357
Come to me!

808
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:09,707
My son!

809
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:51,337
- Die! 
 - Kang San, no!

810
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:53,697
Die!

811
01:08:59,777 --> 01:09:03,967
♫  I keep fighting, still fighting  ♫

812
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:13,797
♫  The fate ahead of me can never stop  ♫

813
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:19,297
♫  No matter how many times I'm born again  ♫

814
01:09:19,297 --> 01:09:22,217
   

815
01:09:22,217 --> 01:09:23,517
 Kang San is in danger! 

816
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:26,407
 It looks like a change is happening to Kang San's body. 

817
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:28,927
 I think it's time for one person's sacrifice. 

818
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:31,477
 The case will be closed due to having no grounds to prosecute. 

819
01:09:31,477 --> 01:09:33,557
 I'm the law in this place. 

820
01:09:33,557 --> 01:09:36,117
 Seek those children's forgiveness! 

821
01:09:36,117 --> 01:09:37,987
 Brother can't get back up again. 

822
01:09:37,987 --> 01:09:39,607
 This bastard was the true villain. 

823
01:09:39,607 --> 01:09:40,947
 Aren't you getting the idea? 

824
01:09:40,947 --> 01:09:42,857
 I think we found Lee Ha Neul. 

825
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:44,247
 He hasn't left the country yet. 

826
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,497
 Team 1, go to his residence. 

827
01:09:45,497 --> 01:09:46,937
 Leave with Kang San. 

828
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:50,117
 The boy from the past goes back to the past. 

829
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:53,247
 Right now, Kang San needs his brother. 

830
01:09:53,247 --> 01:09:58,657
♫  The times I fell asleep in the dark  ♫
