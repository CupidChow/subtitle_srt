1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,770
Are you...

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,010
really Kang San?

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,370
Are you...

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,850
Lee Kang San?

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,810
Yes.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm sorry...

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,550
I couldn't keep our promise to take a picture...

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,100
together at the millennium.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:54,990


10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,660
 When it becomes the year 2000, let's take a photo here to commemorate the millennium. 

11
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,020
 The apocalypse won't happen until then. Right? 

12
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,950
   

13
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,280
Yes, it's me.

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,920
Can you look something up for me?

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,390
Hello?

16
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,020
Are you listening?

17
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,590
Yes, yes. I'm all ears.

18
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,560
She's way too drunk that if I just let her be...

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,520
she would've sang all night, so I couldn't help but call you.

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,880
Y-Yes.

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,250
    
 Thank you.

22
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,270
    
 Gosh.

23
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,680
Hey, it got hung up. Sorry.

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,940
Information? What information?

25
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,320
You know how my dad died in a hit-and-run 27 years ago. Right?

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,500
Can you find the investigation report on that?

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,440
 Why do you need that now? 

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,760
- I need to check something. 
 - Why bother?

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,100
- The culprit won't be tried even if we got him. 
 - We should get him.

30
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,150
We need to get him and give him the death penalty.

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,980
- Are you with someone? 
  - I'm working! 

32
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,520
Sorry to keep asking you for favors when you're so busy.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,760
No, it's okay. It's fine. Anyway, I got it.

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,710
Yes. Okay, bye now.

35
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,170
- I said it's okay! 
 - Would you get in, please?

36
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,260
- Yes, bye! 
 - Come on...

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,000
- I don't want to go. 
 - Mother...

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,550
- you need to go home now. 
- What am I going to do at home?

39
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,560
- Hurry up and get in, for goodness' sake! 
 - Hey!

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,300
I'll escort you home. Okay?

41
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,430
G-Gosh!

42
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,080
Gosh, Police Officer, I was...

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,910
You know, today... my son kept asking about his dad...

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,210
Please quit it now and get in.

45
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,520
That's not what I'm saying!

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:29,490
My son delivered newspapers... worked at gas stations...

47
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,890
and started working in middle school to make money... b-because he was fatherless.

48
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:42,200
Goodness, Mother, but Dong Joo is a successful writer now.

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh, my, it's Yong Dae!

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,420
Yes, I'm Yong Dae! Please get in.

51
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,660
Let's go for round two.

52
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,990
Please get in. We can't go if you don't get in.

53
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,670
All right... Let's go.

54
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,200
   

55
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,970
Hey, what's up?

56
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,700
Let's go inside.

57
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,640
Hey, didn't we just meet?

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,740
You must know that not many writers get to work in fancy environments like this. Right?

59
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,030
You came all the way here to tell me that?

60
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,070
I'm saying that's how well we're treating you.

61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,880
Just cut to the chase. I'm very tired today.

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Hey, why can't you open your PC?

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,310
- What PC? 
 - The proof that you wrote your novel

64
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,080
before Director Shin wrote his scenario. Why can't you open it up?

65
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,750
Why are you b-bringing that up again now?

66
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,470
   

67
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,510
Go ahead.

68
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,310
   

69
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,870
   

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,820
- Hello? 
  - Is Kang San home? 

71
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,050
W-Who?

72
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,810
You didn't hear?

73
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,470
He had called me saying he remembered his name.

74
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,020
I'm calling you because his phone is off right now.

75
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,430
Well, he's not home right now.

76
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,710
What's the reason he gave you a call?

77
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,540
 Of course, he wants to find his family. 

78
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,910
So... did you look into it?

79
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,770
I asked Women and Juvenile Affairs, but no one was reported missing under that name.

80
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,260
I don't know if his memory is wrong or no one reported him missing.

81
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,370
But please tell him I'll look into it more.

82
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,290
Okay.

83
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,250
Hey, why are you so serious on the phone?

84
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,490
It's none of your business. Just continue what you were saying.

85
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,680
Why are you talking about my PC all of a sudden?

86
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,690
Director Shin's family refused to sell us the scenario.

87
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,430
And? We sold the film royalty, and productions are happening soon.

88
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,860
If this isn't resolved, we'll have to settle it in court.

89
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,070
Honestly, even I get more skeptical the more I think about this.

90
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,960
The crimes and the characters are too similar, just described by a different narrator.

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,920
So I plagiarized a scenario I've never even seen?

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,750
I'm sure the court will have the same suspicions.

93
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,790
That's why you go and find the proof you wrote your novel first.

94
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,360
Find the PC, your notebook, or whatever, and bring it!

95
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,020
Why? You don't have any?

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
I got a completely new PC during the move and

97
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,190
I never used notebooks in the first place.

98
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,800
You're saying you don't have it.

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,700
Yes, I don't have it, and I also don't have a reason to prove anything.

100
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,810
Tell me the truth.

101
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,070
What?

102
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,600
Did you really write...

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
"God Is Dead"?

104
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,910
No.

105
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,150
It was the lightning.

106
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,270
Because it was born on a stormy night.

107
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,450
Man, let's make one, then.

108
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,590
- Make what? 
 - A proof.

109
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,030
- What? 
 - This is my business.

110
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,280
The show must go on.

111
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,050
I can't embarrass myself just because of you.

112
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,160
I never expected a writer's ethics from you anyway.

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,170
Our legal team will send you some instructions.

114
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,820
Listen to them and do as they say.

115
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,930
You're smart enough to do that. Right?

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520
I don't think I can do that.

117
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,430
I think it'll be better to be a writer who plagiarized.

118
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,250
It looks like you're misunderstanding something here.

119
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,400
Sending someone like you back into the abyss you came from,

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,950
that's a piece of cake for me.

121
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,910
Whoa...

122
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,650
people who frequently drink liquor that's 900,000 won per shot...

123
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,480
are really on another level.

124
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,710
Creating non-existing evidence and burying an innocent person without breaking a sweat.

125
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,950
If you realize it, bring me the proof, do as I say...

126
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,910
or you can...

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,790
go back to the abyss.

128
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,930
- Just wait. 
 - For what?

129
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,570
The proof you're dying to see.

130
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,490
- I'll show you. 
 - What is it?

131
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,700
The bones of the marlin.

132
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,580
The truth.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
   

134
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,120
   

135
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,560
Are any of these people the students you witnessed at Sopyeong Lake 27 years ago?

136
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,480
I don't know. I couldn't see their faces because it was dark.

137
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,600
Then, could you have...

138
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,750
seen this man before?

139
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,730
Who is it?

140
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,010
What's that montage? Who is it?

141
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,250
   

142
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,190
His name is Lee Ha Neul, who went missing 27 years ago.

143
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,470
   

144
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,710
According to your testimony, a male student stopped other students from assaulting a homeless man. Right?

145
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,960
It seemed that way.

146
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,430
We're not sure... but it was probably this student.

147
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,190
This montage is what the student in this picture is expected to look like today.

148
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,980
It's only an estimate, so it's not exact.

149
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,540
Please observe the aura and the traits.

150
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,370
 Is your knee pain better now? 

151
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,270
Does the picture remind you of anyone?

152
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,750
You know this book, right?

153
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,300
Yes.

154
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,900
Why did you send it to me rather than someone else?

155
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,320
I was told I could trust you, Detective Park.

156
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,800
Who told you that?

157
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,740
Detective Han Min Woo.

158
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,600
You met Detective Han Min Woo before?

159
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,640
He had come to me two years ago.

160
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,040
He came to you right after Jeon Doo Hyeon was killed?

161
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,990
That's right.

162
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,230
His report didn't even have the name Noh Myeong Nam. Right?

163
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,660
It didn't.

164
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,450
This is the first time hearing Min Woo met with Noh Myeong Nam.

165
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,970
Team Leader Oh?

166
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,380
What is it?

167
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,810
Go ahead and explain it to me now.

168
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,440
We agreed to talk about it at home.

169
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,940
Please let me be for one second.

170
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,580
One second passed.

171
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm losing it! This is nuts.

172
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,550
When did you realize I was Lee Kang San?

173
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,980
How did you know I came from the past? Why did you hide it?

174
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,530
Do you remember?

175
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,210
Where did you get this picture?

176
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,340
I went to my old school to meet the principal... and saw that picture in his office.

177
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,920
You were my high school junior?

178
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,930
Yes, Senior.

179
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,810
But you just believed I came from 1995 after seeing this picture?

180
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,150
Even I can't believe it.

181
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,220
You showed all kinds of superpowers before that.

182
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,180
What's so special about a time slip? I would've believed you to be Voldemort.

183
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,030
Who's Voldemort?

184
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,830
In "Harry Potter—"

185
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,400
Never mind. "He who must not be named."

186
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,640
Now that I think about it, they're similar since their names can't be uttered.

187
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,720
Why can't my name be said?

188
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,370
Not you—

189
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,330
Also, even the sneakers you're wearing in the picture are the same.

190
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,350
Brother Ha Neul bought these for me.

191
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,930
But why did you hide it, knowing everything?

192
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,870
You had lost your memories.

193
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,460
Telling you the truth would've only confused you further.

194
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,790
You didn't tell me the truth when I told you about meeting your father.

195
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,000
I was going to tell you after confirming what was going on.

196
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,150
That's really the truth.

197
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,760
Forget it.

198
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,150
I need to find my brother first.

199
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,710
I don't know the specifics, but Brother was in a dangerous situation.

200
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,970
He didn't go missing.

201
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,350
He was hiding away on purpose.

202
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,570
I need to find Brother. I'm sure he has aged since 27 years passed.

203
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,100
But I'm sure he's alive somewhere. We can ask Detective Park—

204
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,240
Are you crazy?

205
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,860
Why?

206
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,790
Will you tell her you came from the past, looking for your missing brother from 27 years ago?

207
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,850
Detective Park will believe me if I tell her honestly.

208
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,960
Your brother... might still be hiding right now.

209
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,510
Detective Park had called me earlier to tell me no one reported you missing.

210
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,950
If he was living ordinarily, there's no way he wouldn't have reported you missing.

211
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,750
You might be putting Kai in danger by contacting the police.

212
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,920
Did you... just say Kai?

213
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,170
You know something, don't you?

214
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,030
You know what happened to my brother. Right?

215
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,530
Stop hiding it and tell me the truth!

216
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,030
Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.

217
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,540
Honestly, I wish you'll live on without knowing anything—

218
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,810
Cut the bullshit and spill it.

219
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,190
What do you know about him?

220
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,200
On top of your nightstand,

221
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,430
I noticed you had the novel. Did you read it?

222
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,040
Why are you asking me that right now?

223
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,530
Because of everything that happened to your brother 27 years ago...

224
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,890
is all written in that novel.

225
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,740
What are you saying?

226
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,370
How would you know what happened to my brother and write it into a novel?

227
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,370
Did your father leave something behind?

228
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,400
No.

229
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,110
I... stole it.

230
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,770
The novel manuscript was in your bag, and I stole that.

231
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,480
I just read it out of curiosity in the beginning.

232
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,420
It was fun and touching. The writing was really great.

233
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,240
I started thinking he was a genius.

234
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,350
I felt pathetic because I couldn't write like that and got jealous of you.

235
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,100
I wasn't going to steal it in the beginning.

236
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,290
I showed the manuscript to my friend, who owns a publishing company, to show off.

237
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,880
And he said we should publish it out of nowhere.

238
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,120
I was desperate back then and needed some money.

239
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,400
But you were unconscious, and he said he'd pay me the signing fee.

240
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,730
That's how the situation spiraled away.

241
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,000
Honestly, I don't want you to read that novel.

242
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,150
Even if you read it, there's something you must know.

243
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,440
The first act is about what happened to your—

244
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,770
- This is important. 
 - I don't want to hear it.

245
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,510
You still have to listen!

246
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,590
 I can't let him find out Lee Ha Neul is committing murders. 

247
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,880
What are you still hiding?

248
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,420
Your brother wrote only the first part of the novel. The manuscript only had up to the first part!

249
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,290
Starting with the second part, I wrote everything. I made it all up!

250
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,410
You only need to read the first part.

251
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,420
Are you saying that as an excuse right now?

252
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm telling you the truth.

253
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,560
Because I wrote the second part.

254
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,590
How shameless.

255
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,150
   

256
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,210
   

257
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,580
   

258
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,150
   

259
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,960
How can you do this during an ongoing investigation?

260
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,680
Once a case is submitted, we also have to take the suspect and investigate.

261
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,500
What case is it?

262
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,030
 Assemblyman Byeon Jong Il is suing Noh Myeong Nam for blackmail, false accusations, and defamation. 

263
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,050
I got it. Go back for now.

264
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,750
We need to take him to do our job!

265
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,730
We're still investigating, too! Go back and wait until we're done with him.

266
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,250
Team Leader Oh, you know our situation.

267
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,170
If the plaintiff hast a gold badge, are you allowed to bypass all procedures? 
  (Meaning an assemblyman) 

268
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,580
Your chief already gave us his approval!

269
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,710
Who said?

270
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,420
You can check.

271
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,910
All right, then. Wait here.

272
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,990
Geez!

273
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,650
If I leave here, he'll kill me for sure.

274
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,590
- You're also on his side. Right? 
 - That's not true.

275
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,580
Never again...

276
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,660
will I just let you experience injustice, Noh Myeong Nam.

277
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,360
I promise you.

278
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,750
And I'm supposed to believe you?

279
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,670
I know I committed a grave sin.

280
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:05,000
Had I not just sat back and watched then... you wouldn't have been framed falsely.

281
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,350
I know you can't trust me... but please trust Detective Park and testify.

282
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,480
   

283
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,760
Gosh, why isn't he answering?

284
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,390
I'll go see the chief, so all of you better wait.

285
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,150
   

286
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,660
Detective Han Min Woo came to me, asking about the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago.

287
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,420
The Lake Sopyeong incident, not Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder?

288
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,340
Yes, he also said Jeon Doo Hyeon was killed.

289
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,450
And then?

290
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,520
I didn't think he would believe me anyway.

291
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:05,520
But I answered since he asked... about how I was framed falsely and unjustly.

292
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,940
 It must've been very tough for you. 

293
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,980
 How did you endure it all this time? 

294
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,730
 I don't think I could've endured it. 

295
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,970
 I'll tell you honestly. 

296
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,530
 You're not yet one of the suspects in Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder. 

297
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,150
 It's not easy to connect someone to a case from 25 years ago. 

298
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,910
 How did you know about me, then? 

299
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,180
 I reviewed all the information from 25 years ago because I got intel from a loan shark. 

300
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,200
 And I found a flaw in the investigation from back then. 

301
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,350
 I came to you to investigate first before telling my team. 

302
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,930
 I'm careful because one of the detectives who was in charge of that case... 

303
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,370
 is my superior. 

304
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,720
 Because I really respect him a lot. 

305
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,250
I felt like he was a trustworthy person.

306
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,760
That's why I told him everything.

307
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Everything I saw on the day Jeon Doo Hyeon died.

308
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,050
What did you see?

309
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,740
   

310
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,550
 Back then, I stayed in front of Byeon Jong Il's house every night for a chance. 

311
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,790
 I wanted to kill him with my own hands. 

312
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,890
 Assemblyman Byeon, are you home? It's Doo Hyeon! 

313
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,310
Are you saying Jeon Doo Hyeon was already dead?

314
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,330
I'm not sure about that, but he was unconscious for sure.

315
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,210
And then?

316
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,950
I followed that car without a second thought.

317
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,270
I followed it to the entrance of the mountain.

318
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,590
- But I was too scared to go further. 
 - Which mountain was it?

319
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,310
Mt. Ogeo.

320
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,280
 Do you remember the vehicle model or the license plate number? 

321
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,540
- It was a black Grandeur. 
 - What about the plate number?

322
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,870
I can't remember.

323
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,430
 Why didn't you report it to the police right away? 

324
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,050
Who would believe the words of an ex-murder convict?

325
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,560
Also, Byeon Jong Il is obviously the one who instigated Jeon Doo Hyeon's death.

326
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,500
I was afraid of being framed again.

327
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,590
Is that why you asked if we checked the CCTVs in front of Byeon Jong Il's home?

328
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,490
Because Detective Han said he'd check it that day.

329
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,580
But the next day, hearing Detective Han died...

330
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,400
I felt like it was my fault.

331
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,600
   

332
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,440
Yes, Hyungnim.

333
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,040
Everyone, go back.

334
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,490
From now on, Noh Myeong Nam is an important witness and reference for our case.

335
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,820
We'll request personal protection and take care of him. So go back.

336
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,550
Also, hand over Assemblyman Byeon's case.

337
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,610
We'll investigate that, too. Understood?

338
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,340
   

339
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,860
 Please keep this in mind. 

340
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,530
 When the detectives come to you, you have to tell them what I told you to say. 

341
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,110
   

342
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,720
♫  Imma tell you I can't stop now  ♫

343
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,060
♫  Nothing's holding me back now  ♫

344
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,270
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

345
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,530
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

346
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,760
♫  Show you I can't fall now  ♫

347
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,040
♫  Cannot tell me to slow down  ♫

348
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,180
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

349
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,490
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

350
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,970
♫  I can't let you go  ♫

351
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,890
♫  It doesn't matter what you're feeling honestly  ♫

352
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,000
♫  I feel alive finally, burn to the ground  ♫

353
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,500
   

354
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,620
   

355
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,890
   
   

356
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,470
   

357
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,350
   
   

358
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,950
   

359
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,720
Lake Sopyeong?

360
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,330
Taekang High School...

361
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,030
   

362
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,600
 Bookstore Book and Friends, Literature Best Seller section, Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. Kai. 

363
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,240
   

364
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,260
   

365
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,500
   

366
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,370
   

367
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,920
Hello?

368
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,510
 You arrived on time. 

369
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,800
Where are you?

370
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,100
 - What's the meaning of your message?  
 - Let's talk in person.

371
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,330
You're here right now. Right?

372
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,760
Was that bag in your possession all this time?

373
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,050
I must tell you something in person. It's very important.

374
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,710
 Answer me. 

375
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,390
 How did you end up with the bag? 

376
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,970
Kang San brought it here.

377
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,460
 What did you say just now? 

378
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,910
Lee Kang San...

379
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,680
brought it to me.

380
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,060
You're Writer Yook Dong Joo. Right?

381
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,400
Hello.

382
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,760
- Oh, yes. 
 - Hi.

383
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,480
I'm a really big fan. I was at your signing event, too.

384
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,060
Oh, yes. Thank you.

385
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,060
My friend was going to go as well, but she couldn't.

386
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,230
So could you sign—

387
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,730
I-I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now. E-Excuse me...

388
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,780
Your phone.

389
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,480
M-My phone?

390
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,050
   

391
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,090
What did you do?

392
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,420
You thought I would record or something?

393
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,850
Do you not trust me?

394
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,230
Would you trust you if you were me?

395
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,500
I wouldn't.

396
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,570
It's natural you can't trust me.

397
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,240
Go ahead.

398
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,720
No words can justify what I did.

399
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,100
I know it's an excuse...

400
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,510
- but I didn't intend from the beginning— 
 - Not that.

401
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,000
What did you mean Kang San brought the bag to you?

402
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,610
Oh, well, that's a long story.

403
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,780
Kang San is living with me right now.

404
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,680
What?

405
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,080
We live together right now.

406
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,880
You're saying...

407
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,320
Kang San's alive?

408
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,360
Wait! You thought he had died?

409
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,770
Kang San is alive.

410
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,580
Just the way he was in 1995.

411
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,330
What do you mean?

412
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,210
I'm sure what I'm about to tell you will sound like a madman's gibberish.

413
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,600
It'll sound absurd and ridiculous, but you have to believe me because they're all true.

414
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,650
In 1995, the day Father gave Kang San the bag...

415
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,000
Lee Kang San jumped in front of my car and was hit.

416
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,530
On that day, Kang San slipped through time...

417
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,800
from 1995 to 2022.

418
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,850
I know that face.

419
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,690
Where have I seen him?

420
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:27,790
When he woke up, he couldn't remember anything about himself or where he came from.

421
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,060
But he's been regaining his memories lately.

422
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,260
He remembers his name, Lee Kang San, and that he had a brother.

423
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:40,620
I told you it'd sound like a madman's gibberish.

424
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,200
You're telling me to believe you?

425
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,800
Once you meet Kang San in person... you'll believe what I said.

426
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,690
All right.

427
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,720
Call him up.

428
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,780
- Right now? 
 - Why?

429
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,660
You can't call him right now?

430
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,540
Kang San's not emotionally ready yet.

431
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,360
Also, his phone was off before I got here.

432
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,820
All right.

433
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,630
I'll try calling him.

434
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,820
But... how much are you planning to tell him?

435
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,540
What do you mean?

436
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,740
Kang San doesn't know what his brother has been doing.

437
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,720
He has no idea.

438
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,690
Once he finds out the truth, he won't be able to handle it.

439
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,290
If he goes berserk from the shock and explodes, no one knows what will happen.

440
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,830
Because Kang San...

441
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,060
isn't a normal kid.

442
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,920
On the way here, I've been thinking carefully about this.

443
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,000
Go away with Kang San to somewhere remote like Jeju Island.

444
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,310
You've got a chance to start anew. Forget everything about revenge and all.

445
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,050
Leave with Kang San and start your life again.

446
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,520
I'll give you back all the money I made from the novel.

447
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,720
I did use some of it, but I'll really write my own novel and pay you back.

448
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,130
Don't worry.

449
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,580
How can I not worry here?

450
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:14,730
- Once Kang San finds out— 
 - I have no intention to expose you... for stealing the novel.

451
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,140
I never intended to expose you from the beginning.

452
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:26,520
I contacted you to warn you about how your decision has put you in danger.

453
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,000
You can rest assured.

454
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,370
Are you thinking I'm lying right now because of that?

455
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,260
- Do you have the videotape? 
 - You don't believe me, huh?

456
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,030
- Just answer my question. 
 - Would I be doing this if I had it?

457
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,630
I'd already disclosed it on the media!

458
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,280
The videotape wasn't in the bag in the first place.

459
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,110
- Is that true? 
 - My father died because of that fucking videotape!

460
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,880
Why would I lie about it?

461
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,490
Someone ran over my father on the day he gave the bag to Kang San!

462
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,430
You think this is a coincidence?

463
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,080
My father was murdered!

464
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,630
You're not the only one feeling injustice!

465
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,400
My mother and I lost a husband and a father without knowing the reason!

466
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,800
My innocent father was killed for no reason!

467
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,070
This isn't only about you anymore.

468
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,620
We're already in the same boat.

469
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,950
- Who says? 
 - You think I wanted to be on this boat?

470
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,790
We have to find that videotape before them.

471
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,460
Though we can't punish them through the law, we can at least let the world know

472
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,230
what they've done if we have the videotape.

473
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:41,090
They're also looking for it. They searched my study and my mom's house, too.

474
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,680
We need to find it before they do.

475
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,720
Don't you have any clues?

476
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,080
Are you sure the videotape was inside the bag?

477
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,160
- It has nothing to do with you. 
 - What do you mean?

478
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,100
My father was—

479
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,110
Listen carefully.

480
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,010
Don't stick your nose in my business anymore... or try to find out more about it.

481
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:10,490
Don't try to contact me in any way.

482
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,990
After today, you and I won't be meeting again.

483
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,150
Are you a hero?

484
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,400
Are you an independence fighter or something?

485
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,890
I'm so embarrassed and ashamed of my pathetic self...

486
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,230
but how are you so shameless and proud?

487
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,910
Do you think you're the defender of justice?

488
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,820
Don't confuse revenge with justice!

489
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,240
Not everyone resorts to murder because of their grief!

490
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,270
Murder is not justified for whatever reason!

491
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,090
You should've reported me, then.

492
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,380
You kept your mouth shut even when you knew about the murderer.

493
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,140
Was it for me?

494
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,210
No.

495
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,460
It was for yourself, not anyone else.

496
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,670
Because you were afraid of your flaw being exposed.

497
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,570
But I don't mean to criticize you.

498
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,480
Because everyone pays the price...

499
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,250
for their own choices eventually.

500
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,450
You and...

501
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,600
I alike.

502
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:49,040
Don't make any more dangerous choices, at least for your mother's sake.

503
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,630
Also...

504
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,100
I'm sorry...

505
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,720
Dong Joo.

506
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,580
Everything I said about Kang San is true.

507
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,860
He's with me.

508
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,460
Kang San's also looking for you, Hyung.

509
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,300
Are you...

510
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,710
certain I'm Lee Ha Neul?

511
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,420
What's that supposed to mean?

512
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,950
Are you saying you're not?

513
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,480
Is there something inside?

514
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,030
What is it?

515
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,220
   

516
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,260
It was two years ago.

517
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,410
He must've come to check the CCTVs in front of Assemblyman Byeon's home.

518
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,210
Oh, y-yes. I remember.

519
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,310
Did he heck the CCTVs?

520
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,990
Those CCTVs are privately installed by the assemblyman, so we couldn't check them.

521
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,480
There weren't any CCTVs for public safety purposes?

522
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,510
No, there weren't.

523
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,160
Yes, Team Leader Oh.

524
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,060
A corpse was found at Lake Sopyeong.

525
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,490
We're on our way. Meet us there.

526
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,480
Please wait!

527
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,520
Back then, there was a temporary CCTV to crack down on illegal garbage dumping.

528
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,930
That employee earlier... and I were in charge.

529
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,340
Are you saying you met Detective Han?

530
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,680
Yes.

531
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,900
But another detective took the original footage before he came.

532
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,280
- He took the original? 
 - Yes.

533
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,470
Do you remember that detective's name?

534
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,180
He wouldn't tell us.

535
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,070
What made you trust someone who wouldn't give his name and give him the original?

536
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:13,870
The chief had called in person and ordered us to cooperate with the detective who was coming.

537
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,930
The detective came in and asked if we got the call from the chief and asked for the original. So we didn't have a choice

538
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,210
and asked for the original. So we didn't have a choice.

539
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:25,530
- Did you get the call from the chief yourself? 
 - I can't really answer that.

540
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,010
Considering the other employee's position, too.

541
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:39,190
I gave Detective Han a USB that had the CCTV footage.

542
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,440
What are you talking about?

543
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,820
No matter how I thought about it, it felt really suspicious.

544
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,060
So I made a copy before he took the original.

545
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,500
Because people usually take the copy, not the original.

546
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:59,080
The chief's order was also iffy.

547
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,550
- You're great. 
 - It's nothing.

548
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:04,520
Did you happen to check the footage yourself?

549
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,180
Yes.

550
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,860
 But I don't mean to criticize you. 

551
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,740
 Because everyone pays the price... 

552
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,440
 for their own choices eventually. 

553
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,750
 You and... 

554
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,960
 I alike. 

555
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,940
Wait! You're the writer of "God Is Dead," right?

556
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,490
I'm not.

557
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,130
Aren't you Writer Yook Dong Joo?

558
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,610
I'm not a writer.

559
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,950
I think he is.

560
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,880
He said he wasn't.

561
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,130
Gosh, where is he wandering around?

562
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:23,660
   

563
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,630
What?

564
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,150
A news article? About what?

565
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,250
 An article about plagiarism posted. 

566
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,750
What?

567
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,980
I think Director Shin was the one who leaked it.

568
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,660
I'll send you the link, so check it and come over.

569
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,000
   

570
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,310
   

571
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,930
   

572
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,510
   

573
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,550
   

574
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,460
   

575
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,880
We might come back to ask you again, so don't go too far from home

576
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,110
and stay around the neighborhood. Okay?

577
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,320
Kang San.

578
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,210
Detective Park?

579
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,080
What are you doing here?

580
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,850
Well, the thing is...

581
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:24,170
- Do you know this young man? 
 - Yes.

582
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,070
He's the one who first found the scene, and she made the report.

583
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,200
You came alone?

584
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,230
Yes.

585
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,720
Don't go anywhere and wait for me. Let's talk.

586
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,150
Okay.

587
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,730
What happened to the CCTV footage?

588
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,640
We'll talk about that later.

589
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,780
Could it be Nam Sang Woo who went missing seven years ago?

590
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,430
Not sure.

591
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,980
Why don't we take out the vinyl and check?

592
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,990
The corpse might get damaged in the process.

593
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,680
- We need to take it as is and get an X-ray of it first. 
 - It's the basics.

594
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,690
If it's the same suspect, there should be the same signal.

595
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,290
Probably so.

596
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,760
There's something inside.

597
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,840
What is that?

598
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,740
It's a student I.D.

599
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,550
Lee Ha Neul.

600
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,750
Who?

601
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,030
- Lee Ha Neul. 
 - Are you sure?

602
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,920
Yes, I'm sure.

603
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,410
He's right over there.

604
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,360
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

605
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,950
I'm here.

606
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,760
Who are you?

607
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,350
It's Chang Geun.

608
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,480
My son is here.

609
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,500
Yes, Father.

610
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,480
Why did you come here alone?

611
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:33,750
I just came.

612
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,960
You just came? For no reason?

613
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,270
 - We can ask Detective Park— 
 - Are you crazy? 

614
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,330
 You might be putting Kai in danger by contacting the police. 

615
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,260
I came out of curiosity because this is where Hyung's novel's set.

616
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,390
Writer Yook himself told you that?

617
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,320
That Lake Sopyeong is the novel's setting?

618
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,810
Yes.

619
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,450
And what else did he tell you?

620
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,780
He didn't tell you anything else?

621
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,810
He didn't.

622
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,120
According to the local who reported, you tried to touch the corpse.

623
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,160
Is that true?

624
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,360
I was trying to see what it was.

625
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,070
But...

626
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:23,290
did you get to check... who the corpse is?

627
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,910
We don't know yet.

628
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:30,550
- Are you able to find out? 
 - Even if we do, I can't tell you.

629
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,610
That person was stabbed to death. Right?

630
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,180
What makes you say that?

631
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,790
I saw a hand holding a knife.

632
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,080
And the hand had a cross tattoo.

633
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,600
What?

634
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:50,710
The cross looked familiar, but I can't remember where I saw it.

635
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:55,360
- Are you saying you just saw that? 
 - It's not like I wanted to see it.

636
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,960
It's not something I can control.

637
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,630
Are you saying you have a superpower again?

638
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,800
Yes.

639
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,450
Are you serious right now?

640
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,780
Does my answer matter? Your heart is what matters.

641
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,230
Are you taking after Writer Yook? Why did you become so twisted?

642
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,750
Because you don't believe what I say.

643
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,040
You're going home. Right?

644
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,360
Let me know when you find out who the corpse is.

645
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,910
Why are you so curious about that?

646
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:27,600
There must be a reason why I found that person.

647
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:33,440
- It might be someone I know. 
 - Stop being ridiculous.

648
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,610
There must be... a family looking for that person, too.

649
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,510
Just like me.

650
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,080
I'll take you home.

651
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,500
   

652
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,350
He's a student who found the site. I'll drop him off on the way.

653
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,430
Okay. Everyone else left first.

654
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,600
Okay.

655
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,330
- Get in. 
 - I'll go alone.

656
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,810
It's on the way.

657
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:22,050
- It's more comfortable to go alone. 
 - I'm just worried about you.

658
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,050
I'm not a patient.

659
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,310
Okay. Get home safe, then.

660
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,340
Okay.

661
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,900
Let's go. I'll contact you.

662
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,680
Young man...

663
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,940
Have we met before?

664
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,850
You look familiar.

665
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,000
I don't really know.

666
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,300
Really?

667
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,460
How do you know that student?

668
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,000
Detective Park.

669
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,820
Yes?

670
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,520
Let's go for now.

671
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,110
Yes.

672
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,090
   

673
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,590
So he still has no memory?

674
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:13,350
He remembered his name recently, but I don't think that's for certain.

675
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,400
Why?

676
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,100
He keeps saying weird stuff.

677
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,790
My son also said weird stuff when he was a teenager.

678
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,090
If the corpse really is Lee Ha Neul, we're back to square one.

679
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,020
Since a major suspect will be gone.

680
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:34,720
Let's wait for the NFS's results and focus on what we need to do.

681
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,500
- Go to Mapo. 
 - Why there?

682
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,860
We need to find proof to back up Noh Myeong Nam's testimony.

683
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:47,860
The filming will begin next week, so the film company is also rushing our official announcement.

684
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,670
For the film company, it's actually good news... since it'll serve as noise marketing.

685
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:54,410
The problem is if the court finds it to be an infringement...

686
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,490
Director Shin's film company will request a prohibition from showing.

687
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:02,520
The novel and the scenario have clearly different textual forms.

688
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,780
It's not like the sentences are identical, so it's a comedy to be sued for using the same material!

689
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:13,130
The materials are one thing, but they're raising issues about the characters and descriptions of crucial moments.

690
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,130
The director is also worried about that.

691
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:22,140
If you'll just give us something... all of this will be wrapped up.

692
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:25,040
It's too bad that you can't.

693
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,780
Exactly.

694
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,020
What did the Korean Literature Prize Committee say?

695
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,920
They want to talk to you in private.

696
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,360
They'll probably take a contemplative approach.

697
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,520
I'm sure they'll say they'll wait for us to take an official stance, and they'll decide accordingly.

698
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,880
What about foreign publications?

699
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,860
Luckily, they're quiet so far. They probably haven't gotten the news yet.

700
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,180
Since they've always been so freestyle, they'll keep a watch on domestic opinions.

701
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,930
We need to announce our official statement to the press.

702
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,780
I'll tell you after discussing it with Writer Yook.

703
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,210
Yes.

704
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,670
What did Writer Yook say?

705
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:38,850
Does he really not have any dates of his writing saved on his laptop?

706
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,970
- Did you decide? 
 - Decide what?

707
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,540
I told you.

708
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:50,590
Make up proof as I told you to, bring me proof, or—

709
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:52,240
Get ostracized?

710
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,810
Yes.

711
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,380
Decide here. I can't wait any longer.

712
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,540
Ostracize me or not. Do whatever you want.

713
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,210
- I'll do what I want. 
 - Fame isn't the only thing...

714
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:06,550
you've got to lose.

715
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,770
If the court says it's plagiarism,

716
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:19,280
my company will file litigation for a claim of indemnity against you.

717
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,440
What?

718
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:26,490
The compensation we'll have to pay Director Shin and the production company, the legal fee for hiring a lawyer,

719
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,920
the payment for damages done to our company's reputation,

720
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,150
and your breach of contract due to plagiarism.

721
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:37,180
All of this combined will cost quite a fortune.

722
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,330
Can you handle it?

723
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:41,610
Why don't you just pray that we'll lose in court?

724
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,320
I'm a businessman. We already published the book.

725
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,450
As things get noisier with the lawsuit, we'll sell more and more books.

726
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,600
If we win the case, that's good.

727
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,900
If we lose the case, you're the one who will lose money, fame, or both.

728
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,190
You're doing this on purpose. Right?

729
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,790
To fuck me up.

730
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:05,110
- Me? 
 - Why don't you actively seek settlement?

731
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,450
They're the ones who refused to settle.

732
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:09,570
She said her husband's honor comes before money.

733
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,410
Honor?

734
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,550
What a load of bullshit.

735
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,750
- What? 
 - Forget it!

736
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,500
"God Is Dead" is pure fiction by the writer.

737
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,110
And this is my official statement. Happy now?

738
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:42,570


739
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,170
♫  Imma tell you I can't stop now  ♫

740
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:53,460
♫  Nothing's holding me back now  ♫

741
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,620
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

742
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,840
♫  One day you'll know, know, know  ♫

743
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,160
♫  Show you I can't fall now  ♫

744
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:06,380
♫  Cannot tell me to slow down  ♫

745
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,020
   

746
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,740
 You grew up to be a fine young man. 

747
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,940
 You're really the miracle boy. 

748
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,630
 That cross... 

749
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,660
 I remember where I saw it. 

750
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,260
 It works only if he knew Yook Dong Joo already. 

751
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,940
 Who's that fucking detective? 

752
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,660
 We've got to get the bastard in the footage and get a statement. 

753
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,470
 You have a great worker of god. 

754
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:32,920
 Lee Ha Neul and Lee Kang San aren't the only ones who know the truth behind the incident. 

755
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,440
 There was a female student who was with Lee Ha Neul at Lake Sopyeong 27 years ago. 

756
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,550
 He'll kill you for real if he finds out about this. 

757
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,010
 That bastard is Satan. 

758
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:45,220
 That's just a novel. A novel you wrote yourself. 

759
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,350
 Let's catch that bastard from 27 years ago. 

760
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:53,740
♫  Tell you every time you cry when you try to deny  ♫
