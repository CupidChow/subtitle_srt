1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:06,680
The way to get out of here alive is to be honest.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,780
Why would I trust you?

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm different from you.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,800
I keep my promises.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,230
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Waiting on a Miracle Team 🙏 @ Viki.com 

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,380
All right.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,640
Shall we begin now?

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,610
   

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,990
What do you mean by that?

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,370
I saw Ha Neul and Mr. Noh Myeong Nam together.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,580
Are you saying you saw the situation at Lake Sopyeong 27 years ago?

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,010
Since your brother was there and Noh Myeong Nam was a witness.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,290
It's not that. This one's recent.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,900
- Recent? 
 - Yes.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,000
Ha Neul and that man seemed pretty close.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,950
Tell me more in detail.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,390
Shall we go back 27 years?

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,390
Although you knew the real culprits of the Lake Sopyeong incident,

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,300
you placed the blame on Noh Myeong Nam, a homeless man,

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,650
by creating a fake witness called Jeon Doo Hyeon.

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,760
   
 Wonderland's Black Bear gang has been looking for you. 

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,950
 I don't know them. 

23
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,660
 But they knew you very well, Jeon Doo Hyeon. 

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,750
 I heard you took money from a gambling house. 

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,130
 Whoa, it wasn't me! 

26
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,200
 They went to your countryside home and turned the place upside down. 

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,750
 Your dad's back is broken, and your mom's about to pass away. 

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,830
 - Are you serious? 
 - Killing a person isn't even a light workout for them. 

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,110
 What are you going to do? Will you follow after your folks' funeral or 

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,520
 will you pay off your gambling debt after doing what I tell you to do? 

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,250
 There's a way to pay off my debts? 

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,230
 You'll have quite the sum left after paying them off. 

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,570
 What do I need to do? 

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,950
 It's a simple job. 

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,030
In return for covering up their crimes, you probably received a big amount of money.

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,920
You also probably became

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,840
an assemblyman by using their money and power.

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Noh Myeong Nam already confessed to his crimes and pleaded guilty.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,650
I did... my investigations properly and did my job as a detective.

40
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,450
What are you doing?

41
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,270
W-What are you doing?

42
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,560
W-Why— Hold on! Wait a second!

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,610
P-Please... g-give me some water.

44
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,980
M-My throat's so dry. It's killing me.

45
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm not the one who killed a person.

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,820
You should take your revenge on them. Why are you doing this to me?

47
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,080
- Who are they? 
 - Why are you asking me?

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,820
You were also at the scene.

49
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,440
Tell me what you know.

50
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,540
Who are those bastards?

51
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,740
If I tell you that, will you let me go?

52
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,820
Only if you answer the rest of the questions honestly.

53
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,290
And you're going to hand this recording over to the press after?

54
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,810
I don't trust the press.

55
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,590
And...

56
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,690
you're not the one who I want to put an end to.

57
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,890
Answer me. Who are those bastards?

58
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,550
Lee Tae Man.

59
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,440
Choi Jong Nam. Shin Kyeong Cheol.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,190
Na Sang Woo. Happy now?

61
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,310
No.

62
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,850
Shall we go back two years now?

63
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,260
Why did you kill Jeon Doo Hyeon?

64
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,300
Did you tell Detective Park that Mr. Noh Myeong Nam saw your brother?

65
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,310
- No. 
 - Why not?

66
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,080
I couldn't tell her.

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,240
I just... felt like I shouldn't tell her.

68
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,510
   

69
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,600
Yes.

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,420
Byeon Jong Il went missing.

71
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,210
H-He went missing?

72
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,020
Assemblyman Byeon's family didn't report him missing, so we can't investigate officially.

73
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,840
But I think he was kidnapped based on the circumstances.

74
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,860
Is Kang San next to you by any chance?

75
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,070
Yes.

76
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,110
I'll call you back.

77
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
Who is she saying went missing?

78
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,470
S-She said Byeon Jong Il went missing.

79
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,460
- Byeon Jong Il did? 
 - Yes.

80
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,830
But his family didn't report him missing, so she has to investigate unofficially.

81
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,070
Why wouldn't they report him missing?

82
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,560
Would they want a trash who beats his own daughter like that back home?

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,820
I wouldn't look for him if I were them.

84
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,000
How did Byeon Jong Il go missing?

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,730
She doesn't know the details.

86
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,680
More importantly, did you see anything else when you saw your brother with Noh Myeong Nam?

87
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,870
- Like what? 
 - Like the place those two met or symbols that can help us guess the place.

88
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,580
We need to find your brother.

89
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,530
- There was nothing. 
 - Not a single thing?

90
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,310
Yes.

91
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,330
Detective Park called you to tell you about him?

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,650
Yes.

93
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm going to the convenience store.

94
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,390
I forgot to buy cigarettes.

95
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,840
- I'll come with you. 
 - It's okay.

96
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,450
Just sit back and relax. I'll be right back.

97
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,240
- You need to quit smoking! 
 - I'll think about it.

98
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:30,850
"Not punishing yesterday's crime is the same thing as encouraging tomorrow's crime."

99
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,470
It's what Camus said.

100
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,320
It's a great saying.

101
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,010
Had they punished you for your crime 27 years ago,

102
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,900
Jeon Doo Hyeon would still be alive, too.

103
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,060
I didn't... kill Jeon Doo Hyeon.

104
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,660
False.

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,580
Jeon Doo Hyeon came out of your home as a corpse.

106
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,350
No such thing happened.

107
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,390
Even when there's evidence?

108
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,600
CCTV footage can't serve as evidence.

109
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,700
Same with Noh Myeong Nam's testimony.

110
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,840
I see...

111
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,970
That's why you tried to kill Noh Myeong Nam, disguising it as suicide?

112
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,810
Cut the bullshit.

113
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,700
I admit to covering up the case 27 years ago for money.

114
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,910
However, I've got nothing to do with Jeon Doo Hyeon nor Noh Myeong Nam.

115
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,890
I never killed anyone.

116
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,570
Lake Sopyeong incident's statute of limitations passed, so you admit it.

117
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,640
But you're going to deny the rest?

118
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,390
You're just as sly as ever.

119
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,290
I told you the truth.

120
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,940
Hey.

121
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,550
I also... regret it.

122
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,960
I was too foolish 27 years ago.

123
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,390
Surviving was so hard, and I gave in for money.

124
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,150
I know it sounds like an excuse,

125
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,710
but I didn't do it for my own good and happiness.

126
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,240
I did it for my family.

127
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,420
- Because of my family. 
 - It was because of your family?

128
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,130
Yes.

129
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,970
I wanted to let my one and only daughter study freely and

130
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,260
let my wife have a good life because she's had it tough—

131
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,920
Why did you kill Yook Dong Joo's father?

132
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,950
Why did you kill him? He was someone's husband and father!

133
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,440
Yook Dong Joo was only five years old.

134
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,600
Because of you, who's less worthy than a bug, Yook Dong Joo lost his father.

135
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,060
A great person was killed by a meager human like you!

136
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,520
That man was killed in a hit-and-run.

137
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,980
You're not human.

138
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,800
I said it was a hit-and-run.

139
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,060
Go check it—

140
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,640
Looks like you'll have to die.

141
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,240
There's no reason I should let you live.

142
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,620
- Let me live. 
 - I'll see you in hell.

143
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,790
I killed him!

144
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,510
I killed both Jeon Doo Hyeon and Yook Dong Joo's father.

145
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,110
Yes.

146
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,070
Noh Myeong Nam's case was also my order. It was me.

147
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,610
Let me live.

148
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,110
You got the answer you wanted.

149
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,210
Let me go now.

150
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,320
You promised to let me go if I answered you honestly.

151
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,170
You should've been honest the first time I asked.

152
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,520
   

153
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,810
 Your brother wrote only the first part of the novel. The manuscript only had up to the first part! 

154
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,200
 Starting with the second part, I wrote everything. I made it all up! 

155
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,860
 You only need to read the first part. 

156
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,490
   

157
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,340
   

158
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,950
Did you get any evidence Lee Ha Neul kidnapped him or something?

159
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,990
There's no certain evidence yet, but Lee Ha Neul is the top suspect based on the circumstances.

160
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,700
I think what happened to Noh Myeong Nam aggravated Lee Ha Neul.

161
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,940
We must stop him. If what you said is true, he'll kill Byeon Jong Il.

162
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,470
Before he commits murder, we must stop Lee Ha Neul.

163
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,920
We need to find him before it's too late.

164
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,080
We're also looking. I'll call you again when things change.

165
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,570
Detective Park!

166
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,310
I'll call you back.

167
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,050
- Byeon Jong Il's phone was reached. 
 - Did he answer the call?

168
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,050
The call gets connected, but he's not picking up.

169
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,610
Retreat from there for now and come back with Detective Kim.

170
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,140
What are you saying?

171
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,430
He said he was going to the bathroom earlier.

172
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,960
- But he's not here yet. 
  - How long has it been? 

173
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,500
- It's been about 40 minutes. 
 - What about his phone?

174
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,820
It's off. I can't see him anywhere around the area.

175
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,530
- Gosh, this is insane. 
 - I think something happened to Detective Kim.

176
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,520
Maybe he was ambushed by Byeon Jong Il's henchmen.

177
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,230
Go to Detective Kim's home right now.

178
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,480
His home?

179
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,360
When you see Detective Kim, bring him here by any means necessary!

180
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,470
What do you mean?

181
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,180
 Are you sure? 

182
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,110
Does that make sense?

183
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,420
Stop joking, please.

184
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,050
 Lee Ha Neul is dead. 

185
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,050
 He doesn't exist in this world. 

186
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,120
 Are you saying you'll never meet Kang San? 

187
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,690
 Did you forget I'm a murderer? 

188
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,570
- You're back? 
 - Yes.

189
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,270
I was going to buy twisted donuts on the way back, but they closed early today.

190
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,170
Hyung, here.

191
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,730
It was on the dinner table.

192
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,310
I went outside for no reason.

193
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,130
Hyung.

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,490
You don't need to worry about me.

195
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,240
W-What are you saying?

196
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,390
You told me this before.

197
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:51,010
Although we couldn't stop what had already happened, what matters the most is this moment and on.

198
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,110
- Kang San. 
 - I understand you want to protect me.

199
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,180
However, I should know what's happening to Ha Neul.

200
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,690
Tell me, Hyung.

201
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,480
People sometimes...

202
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,590
do wrong deeds to do the right thing, just like your brother.

203
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,520
We need to help your brother right now.

204
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,790
Your brother— I mean,

205
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,460
Ha Neul has been on his own for 27 years.

206
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,770
However, he's not alone anymore. He has us.

207
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,550
We need to... go and help Ha Neul.

208
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,400
I guess you feel like you became the defender of justice.

209
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,460
But you're only a murderer, too.

210
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,630
You're the one who killed Shin Kyeong Cheol.

211
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,810
I was a fool to trust your promise.

212
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,380
I forgot a person who's killed once can do it a second time.

213
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,350
Oh, I finally remember it after hearing what you said.

214
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,580
It's time for the last question.

215
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,950
This is your last chance at survival.

216
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,930
Na Sang Woo, who went missing seven years ago.

217
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,020
Where is he right now?

218
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,590
Na Sang Woo?

219
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,310
I told you.

220
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,630
You're not my target.

221
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,300
There's not much time left.

222
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,860
If I tell you what I know,

223
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,990
will you let me go this time?

224
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,330
- Of course. 
 - Can you swear to god?

225
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,010
God?

226
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,480
I swear to Yook Dong Joo's father.

227
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,770
Na Sang Woo...

228
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,640
went missing after meeting Chairman Lee Tae Man.

229
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,380
Lee Tae Man?

230
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,260
Yes.

231
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,260
- How do you know this? 
 - That day,

232
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,110
I met Na Sang Woo on my way out from Chairman Lee's office.

233
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,470
He was drunk out of his mind.

234
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,320
 He said he came to meet Lee Tae Man. 

235
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,800
 I haven't seen Na Sang Woo since. 

236
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,960
Are you saying... Lee Tae Man killed Na Sang Woo?

237
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,640
All I know is that that was the last day I saw Na Sang Woo.

238
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,920
- Just as I thought. 
 - Keep your promise now.

239
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,230
I'll keep everything that happened here a secret.

240
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,040
So let me go.

241
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,680
I should.

242
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,510
Who should arrive first for it to be advantageous for you?

243
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,540
What do you mean?

244
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,890
I think he left it on intentionally to mislead the investigation.

245
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,250
This is a place without CCTVs he had chosen in advance.

246
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,330
That's probably what he did.

247
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,640
 40-21 Daewisan Street, Mancheon District. 

248
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,070
 Byeon Jong Il is there. 

249
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,210
 Hurry up. 

250
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,860
What's wrong?

251
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,110
- I know where Byeon Jong Il is. 
 - Sorry?

252
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,400
   

253
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,680
 Tell me what you know. 

254
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,610
 Who are those bastards? 

255
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,460
 If I tell you that, will you let me go? 

256
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,220
 Only if you answer the rest of the questions honestly. 

257
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,270
 And you're going to hand this recording over to the press after? 

258
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,290
 I don't trust the press. 

259
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:41,740
 Also, you're not the one I want to put an end to. 

260
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,520
 Answer me. 

261
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,640
 Who are those bastards? 

262
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:59,070
 Lee Tae Man. Choi Jong Nam. Shin Kyeong Cheol. Na Sang Woo. Happy now? 

263
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,300
   

264
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,650
   

265
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,000
   

266
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,740
 When it rains and the sky darkens,  
  (Sky has the same sound/spelling as Ha Neul in Korean.) 

267
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,690
 Kang Mountain cries sadly like a child who has nowhere to go.  
 (San has the same sound/spelling as "rivers and mountains")

268
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,790
 After the rain stops and the sky brightens up, 

269
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,790
 Kang Mountain blooms like a fresh wildflower. 

270
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,380
 It doesn't have to be a sunny sky. 

271
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,530
 Even if he cries or it rains on the way, 

272
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,090
 as long as he can be where he can touch the sky, 

273
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,760
 Kang Mountain wants to be there right now. 

274
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,800
♫  At the end of this tunnel, there will be light  ♫

275
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:12,680
♫  Burn like the sun in the sky, it's gonna be all right  ♫

276
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,380
Byeon Jong Il, that crazy motherfucker.

277
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,210
Just how many people did he kill?

278
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,940
Did you know he even killed Yook Dong Joo's father?

279
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,160
Is that what matters right now?

280
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,820
Is this... really from Ha Neul?

281
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,100
But Ha Neul was found as skeletal remains.

282
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,830
What was found was his I.D.

283
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,700
Not Lee Ha Neul.

284
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,100
That's right.

285
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,900
That's true.

286
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:57,590
In that case, what do you think is the reason Lee Ha Neul sent this to you?

287
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Seeing how you're pissing yourself, looks like Ha Neul achieved his goal.

288
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,590
Should you really be joking right now?

289
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,890
If this video gets leaked, it's all over! We have to stop it, no matter what!

290
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,050
Wait! There's no way you're just going to watch, right?

291
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,790
That's why we should watch for now.

292
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,210
What do you mean?

293
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,040
Sending him the address means we mustn't go there.

294
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,150
Because it's a trap.

295
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,730
So, should we just sit still like lame ducks?

296
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,530
If someone else gets hold of that video, then what?

297
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,510
Lee Ha Neul has the video anyway.

298
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,180
He can let the world know whenever he wishes.

299
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,290
So we should just let him screw us over like this?

300
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,480
He'll have to deal with him.

301
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,220
How?

302
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,900
Hye Kyeong, congrats.

303
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,820
For what?

304
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,890
The resurrection of Lee Ha Neul.

305
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,840
Isn't it good news for you?

306
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,720
Of course.

307
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,520
Of course, I should be happy my friend's alive.

308
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,260
Don't you agree, Tae Man?

309
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,660
Are you okay?

310
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,820
U-Untie these ropes first.

311
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,310
Are you okay?

312
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,920
- Do you want to go to the hospital first? 
 - N-No.

313
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,710
I want to go home and rest.

314
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,030
You have symptoms of dehydration. Shouldn't you go to the hospital—

315
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,340
There's no need. I'm okay.

316
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,970
I just need to go home, take a shower, and get some sleep.

317
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm sorry, but please come with us to the station for a moment.

318
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,890
Lee Byung Man, what the hell are you saying?

319
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,150
I'm sure you know, but a victim's testimony is more accurate when it's taken sooner.

320
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,270
That's how we can arrest the culprit faster.

321
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,450
I must get some rest at home right now.

322
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,750
Sure.

323
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:53,450
Oh, just for your information, I secured new evidence in regards to Jeon Doo Hyeon's case.

324
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,920
New evidence?

325
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,210
I told your aide, but looks like you didn't hear, huh?

326
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,730
I have nothing more to tell you!

327
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,210
In that case,

328
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,400
after I checked the recorded video here, should I contact you again tomorrow?

329
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,720
Who knows what will happen overnight? Wouldn't it be better to explain yourself as soon as possible?

330
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,170
Who was that?

331
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,510
Byeon Jong Il is at the police station.

332
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,210
What?

333
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,570
I think Lee Ha Neul simultaneously sent the message to me and the police.

334
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,530
And the video?

335
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,110
The police probably obtained it.

336
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,140
Damn it. This is nuts!

337
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,720
It's all over.

338
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,170
What should we do now?

339
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,920
What should we do, Tae Man?

340
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,300
Huh?

341
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,490
What can we do?

342
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,320
The video is out of our hands.

343
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,720
We need to get Byeon Jong Il released first.

344
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,520
Who cares if Byeon Jong Il dies or not? What about the video?

345
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,070
Is your brain for show?

346
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,570
Why are you sitting in that position?

347
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,670
The law is used at times like these.

348
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,260
We found Byeon Jong Il.

349
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,060
- Is he alive? 
  - Yes. 

350
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,200
That's a relief.

351
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,400
How ironic.

352
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,920
He's the one who killed my father, yet I'm relieved he's alive.

353
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:43,090
By chance... did Byeon Jong Il say who his abductor was?

354
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,030
His attorney isn't here yet, so he's remaining silent.

355
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,480
But I think it is Lee Ha Neul.

356
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,760
The camcorder recording was at the scene.

357
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,650
It's a video of Byeon Jong Il confessing.

358
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,800
- A confession video? 
 - Yes.

359
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,160
He was asked only things that Lee Ha Neul could know and Byeon Jong Il confessed.

360
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,530
Everything, including Noh Myeong Nam.

361
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,440
Did he also admit... to killing my father?

362
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,220
 Yes. He admitted it. 

363
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,290
Lee Ha Neul's intention was to get him to confess, not murder.

364
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,190
That's a relief.

365
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,730
Then... will Byeon Jong Il be incarcerated now?

366
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,780
I can't guarantee it.

367
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,300
But you said you obtained his confession video.

368
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,030
He's going to claim it was a false confession under threats.

369
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,500
That's just what he claims.

370
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,910
Can't we just determine the credibility of the confession?

371
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:52,830
There's been a breakthrough thanks to Lee Ha Neul, so we must obtain Byeon Jong Il's confession, no matter what.

372
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,170
I'll call you again.

373
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,990
Are you okay?

374
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,470
Yes, I'm okay.

375
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,930
You don't need to be okay.

376
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,510
It's normal not to feel okay.

377
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,830
It's a relief that Byeon Jong Il is alive.

378
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,020
Of course, it is.

379
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,980
I need to crush him with my own hands.

380
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:29,270
He can't die that easily since he killed my father. I'll make him rot in prison for the rest of his life. Just watch.

381
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,180
Do you want some ramen?

382
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,720
How can you eat ramen at a time like this?

383
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,870
It's 9:00 p.m., and we haven't had dinner yet.

384
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,780
You're right.

385
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,010
- Should we cook three? 
 - I'll cook four.

386
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,740
- Four? 
 - We need to eat well to fight well.

387
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,600
 Assemblyman Byeon is a victim! 

388
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,050
Assemblyman Byeon came to make a victim's statement despite his mental shock.

389
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,680
He didn't come here to sit through this ridiculous interrogation!

390
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:08,570
I'll make sure to seek legal measures against the police's unreasonable and illegal investigation today.

391
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,360
Let's go, Assemblyman Byeon.

392
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,170
Sit down.

393
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,300
- Sit down, Assemblyman Byeon. 
 - Look here!

394
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,410
Assemblyman Byeon is a prime suspect in Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder.

395
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,390
Lee Byeong Man, have you gone nuts?

396
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,940
- There's evidence. 
 - What are you saying?

397
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,240
If you leave now without an explanation, I can't guarantee what will happen.

398
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,400
- Is that a threat? 
 - It's fine.

399
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,120
Let's hear what he has to say.

400
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,340
It's a video from the day Jeon Doo Hyeon was murdered.

401
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:01,610
We can't confirm if he was alive four hours after entering your house,

402
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:06,240
but as you can see, he was loaded onto an anonymous car while unconscious

403
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,370
and was found dead the next day.

404
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,850
That's your evidence?

405
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:19,770
Like I said, Jeon Doo Hyeon was just some loser I knew when I was a detective.

406
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,110
He randomly came to my house to complain that day,

407
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,950
 and my only mistake was giving him alcohol. 

408
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,450
 He got drunk and spoke nonsense, but he made a call, and someone came to pick him up. 

409
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,750
 In Jeon Doo Hyeon's call history, 

410
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,960
- What about Detective Kim? 
  - you're the last person he called that night. 

411
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,140
 I wouldn't know about that. 

412
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,540
He's a loan shark, so he could've used a burner phone.

413
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,760
Why did you lie two years ago?

414
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,800
What do you mean, lie?

415
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,230
When we asked you two years ago, you only admitted to the call with him.

416
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,210
You said you didn't meet Jeon Doo Hyeon that day.

417
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,170
I must've been mistaken at the time.

418
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,410
The day after this video was recorded,

419
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,680
it's also confirmed the original copy of this video was collected from the district office on your orders.

420
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,790
That didn't happen.

421
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,100
There's a witness.

422
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,010
How could there be a witness to something that never happened?

423
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,710
Unless it's a false witness.

424
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,470
Think about it, Chief.

425
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,970
We need to catch the culprit.

426
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:32,420
Does it make sense to drag the victim to the station? An assemblyman at that?

427
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,860
If this gets released to the press, you might lose your job.

428
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,490
I was going to call the commissioner general.

429
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,900
But I still gave you a heads-up first.

430
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,500
So, wrap it up nicely on your end.

431
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,810
Make sure the detectives in charge keep their mouths shut.

432
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,980
 I killed both Jeon Doo Hyeon and Yook Dong Joo's father. 

433
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,290
 Yes. 

434
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,420
 Noh Myeong Nam's case was also my order. It was me. 

435
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,250
 Let me live. You got the answer you wanted. 

436
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,110
 Let me go now. 

437
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,880
 You promised to let me go if I answered you honestly. 

438
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,880
You confessed you killed Jeon Doo Hyeon yourself

439
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,530
and admitted to instigating the murder of Noh Myeong Nam

440
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:32,760
who witnessed Jeon Doo Hyeon being lugged out of your house.

441
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,010
It was a false confession under threat.

442
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,640
Everything falls into place too perfectly for it to have been a false confession.

443
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,050
False confession coerced by threats won't be accepted as evidence.

444
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,030
Did you see the face of your abductor?

445
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,310
Can you guess who it might be?

446
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,910
It's someone I don't know.

447
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,260
Wasn't it Lee Ha Neul?

448
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,550
Who's Lee Ha Neul?

449
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,560
Your memory is quite dull today.

450
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,420
Don't you remember the high school student who was

451
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,710
a witness to the Lake Sopyeong case, who personally sought you out 27 years ago?

452
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,640
That student was a witness?

453
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,490
The fact that Chairman Lee Tae Man, Inspector General Choi Jong Nam, Movie Director Shin Kyeong Cheol,

454
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,130
and Na Sang Woo are the real culprits...

455
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm sure you heard it directly from Lee Ha Neul.

456
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,380
That never happened.

457
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,860
Then, how did you know those names and say them in the video?

458
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,670
The abductor only asked who the real culprit behind the Lake Sopyeong case was,

459
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,460
but you specifically named these four people.

460
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,970
There's no need to answer.

461
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,330
Oh, Chief!

462
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,540
Are you crazy? What's the meaning of this?

463
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:50,380
When the camera was off, the abductor told me all four of their names.

464
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,060
He threatened to kill me if I didn't answer with those names.

465
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,750
I've known you for a long time,

466
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:06,560
but the sight of you in the video was the most honest and humane I've ever seen you.

467
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,480
Do you not want to retire quietly?

468
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,170
How dare a mere detective—

469
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,370
Shut your mouth!

470
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,190
You call yourself human?

471
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,080
Don't you have an ounce of conscience?

472
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,500
How could you be so brazen after killing innocent people?

473
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,890
Aren't you ashamed to face your juniors?

474
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,740
- Do you want to die? 
 - Let go!

475
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,140
Assemblyman Byeon!

476
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,220
What are you doing?

477
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,180
Sue that bastard for special assault!

478
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,630
Understood.

479
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,520
I'm sorry, Assemblyman Byeon. I'll be sure to discipline him.

480
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,350
You did great.

481
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,750
That felt great.

482
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,100
We can just catch him again.

483
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,770
Who are we?

484
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,580
- Sowon Police Station's... 
 - Violent Crimes Team 3!

485
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,050
Exactly! We'll just catch him again.

486
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,430
We'll catch him again.

487
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,600
He just left.

488
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,830
   

489
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,940
Chairman Lee is waiting for you.

490
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,350
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

491
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:52,020
All right. Good job.

492
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,060
   

493
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,600
 Detective Kim, where are you? 

494
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,760
 At least leave a message with your whereabouts. I'll go to you. 

495
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,220
 We've been through so much together. 

496
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,570
 We'll get through this together. 

497
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,000
 Please contact me. 

498
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,750
 Where are you right now? Get your ass over here. 

499
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,610
 Detective Kim, people make mistakes and wrong choices. 

500
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,590
 That doesn't mean the world is over. 

501
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,210
 I'm going to kill you if you think bad thoughts. 

502
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,420
 Call me when you hear this message. 

503
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,260
 Senior, this is Hyeon Soo. 

504
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,030
 The pork restaurant auntie said she'll serve you 

505
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,260
 your favorite pork belly on the house since you collected all the coupons. 

506
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,190
 Soju is on me. 

507
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,410
 Please hurry back. 

508
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,910
 You probably had your own reasons for your actions. 

509
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,640
 But that doesn't condone your actions. 

510
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,660
 The chance to right your wrongs lies in your own hands. 

511
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,860
 Life is long. 

512
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,330
 You can start afresh after righting things. 

513
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,610
 You have your family and colleagues. 

514
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,230
 Have some courage. We'll help you. 

515
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,320
What are you staring at?

516
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,890
The stars.

517
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,340
T-They're not there.

518
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,360
They're there. You just can't see them.

519
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,950
You're right.

520
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,080
Just because I can't see them doesn't mean they're not there.

521
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,360
 My father got too close to the truth behind the Sopyeong Lake incident. 

522
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,690
 That's why he was murdered. 

523
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:35,220
 And that videotape has footage of the incident at Sopyeong Lake. 

524
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,010
Did you go to that extent for Brother?

525
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:47,100
Is Brother that exceptional to you, Father?

526
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,560
What is he to you?

527
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,850
Would you have done the same for me, too?

528
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,410
You wouldn't have.

529
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:19,380
You always told me... not to surpass Brother.

530
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:25,000
So I always yielded to Brother until now.

531
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,180
But, Father...

532
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,900
I want to stop now.

533
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,340
It's not my fault I'm the illegitimate child.

534
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,230
Brother wasn't qualified nor capable of leading Taekang Group to begin with.

535
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,910
Don't worry, Father.

536
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,360
You have me.

537
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,950
What in the world are you thinking?

538
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,230
How could you call him here when we should be avoiding him for the time being?

539
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,740
Here he comes.

540
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,250
At this time?

541
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,860
All right.

542
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,710
The gall of those bastards.

543
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,860
Where did he go?

544
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,360
Fortuna.

545
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,390
- He's meeting with Lee Tae Man? 
 - Not just Lee Tae Man.

546
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,890
Detective Kang confirmed Inspector General Choi Jong Nam's car is also parked in the lot.

547
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,440
You would think he'd avoid meeting them on a day like today.

548
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,730
What could he be thinking?

549
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,880
He's probably looking down on the police since we can't even arrest a murderer right in our faces.

550
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,810
If we could at least get a confession out of one of Byeon Jong Il's henchmen.

551
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,480
Why do you think Lee Ha Neul sent us the video?

552
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,770
Probably to reveal the truth.

553
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,750
If that was his intention, he could've sent it to the press or media.

554
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,520
He's right.

555
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,070
Lee Ha Neul probably guessed Byeon Jong Il would be released.

556
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,910
 You've been through quite the ordeal. 

557
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,210
 Congratulations on your safe return. 

558
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,950
Are you feeling okay?

559
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,270
I heard you didn't even go to the hospital.

560
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,710
This doesn't warrant the hospital.

561
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,320
I'm a bit tired, but I'm fine.

562
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,930
Your stamina is incredible. I would've fainted already.

563
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,460
You have good stamina.

564
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,420
But you couldn't be an independence activist because of your weak mentality.

565
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,200
Since you confess so easily,

566
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,560
you would've sold your country if you were tortured, wouldn't you?

567
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,400
I don't quite understand...

568
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,650
We watched the video of you selling us out to Lee Ha Neul.

569
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,250
You should've done your job right if you accepted our money.

570
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,930
This wouldn't have happened if you got rid of Lee Ha Neul properly back then.

571
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,590
- Don't cross the line. 
 - Am I wrong?

572
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,520
   

573
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,550
Since this shit is your fault,

574
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:33,380
you better take responsibility if the video gets leaked.

575
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,990
False confessions under threat hold no legal efficacy, so there's no need to worry.

576
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:41,700
I'm not worried. Why would I be worried?

577
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:48,650
The past is the past, and people grow from their mistakes when they were young.

578
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,020
You're right.

579
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:56,340
But the problem is you're still making mistakes now, Assemblyman Byeon.

580
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,800
- The recorded video— 
 - I'm not talking about that.

581
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,280
Why did you kill so many people?

582
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,220
Jeon Doo Hyeon and Noh Myeong Nam were understandable, but even Yook Dong Joo's father?

583
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,720
I got chills while watching that video.

584
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,810
That's what I'm saying.

585
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,070
Are you a psychopath?

586
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,670
Are you a murderous spirit?

587
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,070
I did it for you people!

588
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,070
   

589
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:38,930
He knew too much, so I had no choice.

590
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,620
I see.

591
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,080
I should've been thanking you.

592
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,290
I'm sorry if I offended you.

593
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:53,470
What are you saying now?

594
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,750
There's no choice if they know too much.

595
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:06,980
Thank you for coming all the way here when you are probably exhausted.

596
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,980
It's fine.

597
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:16,470
Watching that video is more than enough to misunderstand.

598
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,450
I'll take care of things, so you don't need to worry.

599
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,900
The Inspector General will help, too.

600
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,510
- Why the hell would I— 
 - Of course.

601
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:34,660
You're the one who shouldn't worry and just rest.

602
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,480
Madam is attending an all-night vigil at Haneul Temple.

603
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,350
All right.

604
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,980
I'm sorry for your trouble, Assemblyman Byeon.

605
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,190
Good work.

606
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,140
   

607
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,890
- He just got home. 
  - All right. Clear out. 

608
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,080
Understood.

609
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:28,370
That ungrateful... lot of murderers.

610
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,150
   

611
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,280
What the hell are you up to?

612
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,920
Why do the detectives have the CCTV footage?

613
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,960
There's no time to explain that. I'm going to die at this rate.

614
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,860
My identity has been exposed. I need money.

615
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:51,430
Whether I go off the grid or stow away, I need money to do so.

616
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,190
All right.

617
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:59,380
And... where's Cheetah right now?

618
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,410
The detectives are staking out Cheetah's house.

619
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,990
His identity has been exposed.

620
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:09,520
If he's arrested, you're done for as well.

621
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,760
You need to live in order for me to survive as well.

622
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,940
I'll meet up with Cheetah, and we'll find a way, so just tell me where he is.

623
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,680
   

624
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,940
Where are you?

625
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,670
Detective Kim will go to your studio.

626
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,900
Keeping him alive will bring calamity.

627
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,250
Take care of him on your own.

628
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,620
What the hell—

629
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,350
Detective Kim.

630
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,800
Let's go.

631
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,560
Where?

632
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,140
- You got the call from Assemblyman Byeon. Right? 
 - Yes.

633
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,030
Please get in.

634
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:47,440
- Where are we going? 
 - Somewhere safe.

635
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,020
Where exactly is that?

636
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,750
Just get in for now.

637
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,590
- Let's go somewhere really safe. 
 - What the—

638
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,650
   

639
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:54,670
- You punk, you! 
 - Detective Kim!

640
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,410
Senior.

641
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,180
I'm sorry.

642
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,360
Let's talk inside. Come on.

643
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,490
   

644
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,410
Hello?

645
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:40,150
- Yeah, Mom? 
 - Hey, I really remember now!

646
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:44,760
What do you mean, what? I remember where I left the wooden car.

647
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,970
Don't make me waste my time again.

648
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:54,350
Geez, you made me turn Yong Dae's house inside out last time.

649
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,780
It's for real this time. I'm sure of it.

650
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,780
You said you were sure you gave it to Yong Dae's dad, too.

651
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,340
I'm sure of it for certain this time.

652
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,360
- Where is it? 
 - Mom has it.

653
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,460
- It's at your house? 
 - No, no. At my mom's house.

654
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,360
It's at Grandma's house.

655
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,700
Grandma's?

656
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,220
Do you remember how I briefly left you at Grandma's house during our move?

657
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,230
- You remember, right? 
  - And? 

658
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:23,360
You insisted on bringing it with you at the time, so we brought it there.

659
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,930
Did you check with Grandma?

660
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,080
 You know Grandma doesn't really pick up her phone. She might have gone out to the field. 

661
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,150
All right. I'll pay a visit.

662
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,280
-  Dong Joo! Dong Joo! 
  - Yeah?

663
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,900
Grandma likes castella bread. Take some with you.

664
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,710
 - All right.  
- Grandma's going to be so happy.

665
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:43,310
She bragged to the entire neighborhood about your successful career.

666
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,840
I'll call you when I get back. Bye.

667
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:03,810
 There's somewhere I need to go. I'll call you. Don't worry, Hyung. 

668
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,800
   

669
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,430
   

670
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,340
 Kill him! Just kill him! 

671
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:35,230
   

672
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,730
Why do you suddenly want Noh Myeong Nam's home address?

673
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,110
I'm hoping I might see something different if I'm there in person.

674
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,030
Is his house attached to the cleaner?

675
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,310
They're separate.

676
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,150
Then please tell me both.

677
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,010
Is Writer Yook going with you?

678
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,160
No, I'm going alone.

679
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,050
Don't do that. I'll go with you later.

680
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,390
Or have Writer Yook accompany you.

681
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:57,560
Don't worry. I'll let Hyung know.

682
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,160
And I might not even see anything.

683
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,460
Hey, Yong Dae!

684
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,750
Where are you going?

685
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,160
What brings you here?

686
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,320
I just came.

687
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,320
- Just because? 
 - I came because I was worried about my friend.

688
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,790
Saying something so formidable that nonchalantly didn't seem normal to me.

689
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,060
- Let's go. 
 - Where are we going?

690
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,580
You'll know when we get there.

691
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,310
Well, where—

692
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:02,790
Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Around here, could there be...

693
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:12,640
It seems like a container house with many trees,and it's isolated.

694
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,700
It's a square house with one floor. It had huge windows.

695
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,530
I don't think there were any other houses nearby.

696
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,260
Are you talking about that place?

697
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,700
Where's that place?

698
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,090
Grandma!

699
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,960
Grandma!

700
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:34,060
Did she go out to the field?

701
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,470
Give her a call.

702
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:39,510
She doesn't pick up her phone.

703
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,660
I-Is this it?

704
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,070
Hey, look for an empty pot and a shovel.

705
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,570
Yeah, sure.

706
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,240
Hey, you're going to damage the flower.

707
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,010
It's not here.

708
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:52,130
Look carefully.

709
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,960
Geez, it must be somewhere else.

710
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,000

 Waiting on a Miracle Team 🙏 @ Viki.com 

711
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,750
Isn't it just an embellishment?

712
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,290
Whoa!

713
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,050
It opened!

714
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,540
   

715
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,740
I found it.

716
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,590
   

717
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,410
Brother.

718
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,920
Brother!

719
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,010
Kang San...

720
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,530
Brother!

721
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,160
Brother!

722
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:13,730
♫  Two trembling hands, anxious eyes  ♫

723
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:18,140
♫  Screaming like I'm going to explode  ♫

724
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:27,410
♫  Match your feet to the sound of your heart, step by step  ♫

725
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,590
♫  I keep fighting, still fighting  ♫

726
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:41,650
♫  The fate ahead of me can never stop  ♫

727
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,910
   

728
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:46,870
 You should never come back here, either. 

729
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,240
 Yook Dong Joo was sending messages to Lee Ha Neul. 

730
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,760
 Did you meet Lee Ha Neul by any chance? Hand him over to us. 

731
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,390
 There will come a tempest. 

732
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,280
 Don't ever get caught. 

733
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,400
 That student met Lee Ha Neul today. 

734
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,800
 This is what Lee Ha Neul was aiming for. 

735
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,590
 You've become a suspect in a murder case that can still be initiated for legal proceedings. 

736
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,670
 I'm thinking about meeting your brother first. 

737
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,800
 What was his second miracle after resurrection? 

738
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,680
 Kang San! 

739
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,260
 The crime scene was just like what you wrote in your novel. 

740
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,230
 I didn't write the novel. 

741
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,720
   
   

742
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,630
♫  In the dark  ♫
