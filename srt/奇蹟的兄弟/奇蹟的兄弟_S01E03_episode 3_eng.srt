00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,910
Yook Dong Joo, the author of "God Is Dead," widely considered the best novel of the year,

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,960
is under fire since it was suggested that he stole the work of an unknown author

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,780
and published it as his own.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,680
 Petitions by readers and netizens to the Blue House to launch an investigation 

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,260
 for the truth have exceeded thirty thousand signees, and some netizens 

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,150
 are boycotting books published by the publisher "Literature and Imagination." 

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,400
 The case is magnifying by day, with personal information of Yook Dong Joo's family being doxxed. 

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,810
Is it true that you stole the novel?

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,850
There's a rumor that you intentionally caused the car crash to steal the manuscript.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,230
Who is the real owner of the manuscript?

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,990
How long were you planning on hiding this?

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,860
How do you feel right now?

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,210
Do you have anything to say to your readers?

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,340
Do you feel guilty at all?

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,180
Are you ready to participate in a police investigation?

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,130
Between Kai and the unidentified boy, who is the real owner of the manuscript? Tell us!

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,470
How long were you planning on hiding this?

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,030
You did something very dangerous.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:06,000
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Waiting on a Miracle Team 🙏 @ Viki.com 

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,990
This novel was never meant to come out to this world.

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,580
   

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,820
   

23
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,500
   

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,740
   

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,100
Gosh, that scared me.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,240
When are you off today?

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,080
 I worked overnight, so I'm about to get off. Why? 

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,730
Can you go to my house and install CCTVs? Not cheap ones. Quality ones.

29
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,430
I'll give you the money later. Oh, and I changed the key code to the front door.

30
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,510
Why? Was there a burglary?

31
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,340
 Call me once you're there. Please and thank you. 

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,070
Dong Joo.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
   

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,020
   

35
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,970
   

36
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,010
Yes.

37
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,220
 Are you okay? 

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,410
What do you mean?

39
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,590
 You remember what happened yesterday. Right? 

40
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,780
 Hey! You asshole... 

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,170
 What? What? 

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,190
Are you calling about that?

43
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,050
No, I'm not.

44
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,530
You know you have an interview today. Right?

45
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,550
  - Author Yook?  
 - Yes, yes. I'm listening.

46
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,800
You need to get here at least an hour before the interview.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,930
You'll need makeup.

48
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,840
We can't photograph you with your face like that.

49
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,560
We'll also be recording a video for the newspaper's website.

50
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,390
Video?

51
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,870
I can't do the interview with my face like this.

52
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,760
Please postpone it.

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,710
 Author Yook. 

54
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,820
You've already postponed it once.

55
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,670
If you miss this interview, we'll be publishing a different kind of news article.

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,600
One about violence and contract violation.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,390
Then do that or whatever.

58
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,480
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,230
It's the clothes you were wearing at the time of the accident.

60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,100
Unfortunately, we had to cut it up during the emergency treatment.

61
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,370
I see.

62
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,430
Oh, there was only one sneaker.

63
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,930
Thank you.

64
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,000
No worries.

65
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,810
 Should I have asked him? I want the writer's autograph and take a picture with him. 

66
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,170
   

67
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,590
 Happy birthday. 

68
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,220
You don't remember who it was?

69
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,220
No.

70
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,590
It must be family.

71
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,860
How come they're not looking for me?

72
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,240
Why are my parents not looking for me?

73
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm sure they're looking for you.

74
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,800
Anyway, this is a positive sign that your memory is returning.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,210
- And you need to check out of the hospital now. 
 - Check out?

76
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,500
Yes, there's nothing more the hospital can do for you.

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,010
If it's okay with you, would you like to stay at my house while you're looking for family?

78
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,020
I figured my house was better than the shelter.

79
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,330
I'll think about it.

80
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,890
Think about it positively.

81
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,450
- I-I'm sorry! 
 - Calm down.

82
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm sorry!

83
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

84
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,410
I am so sorry.

85
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,810
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

87
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,140
Critics are praising the book for its insights into man's desire and the duality of good and evil.

89
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,480
The readers are even experiencing a "God-death" syndrome.

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,610
White death?

91
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,650
No, God-death. Short for "God is dead."

92
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,760
Oh, I see.

93
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,400
I see. It's my first time hearing about it.

94
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,350
The mid-1990s, where the story is set...

95
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,500
- He sounds nervous. 
  - ...the music and the trend from that time are gaining popularity among young people. 

96
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,680
I know.

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,190
I see.

98
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,590
Excuse me, Author Yook. Point your gaze upward a bit, please.

99
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,820
Oh, yes.

100
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,380
Was there a special reason you decided to write this piece?

101
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,550
Well, special reason...

102
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,370
Back then, I was in a desperate situation.

103
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,820
I had to work on my manuscript while working as a courier and a designated driver.

104
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,340
   

105
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,120
I was desperate to write a good novel,

106
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,010
but pouring over the manuscript all night,

107
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,380
and then seeing a blinking cursor in the morning on a blank page led me to meltdowns.

108
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,550
I doubted my ability as a writer.

109
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,410
Does this piece represent a triumph of mental strength?

110
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,820
No.

111
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,800
   

112
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,630
Poverty and physical exhaustion debilitates the mind.

113
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:47,540
Telling someone who can't even make rent to overcome it through mental strength...

114
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,730
is cruel nonsense.

115
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,520
I persevered nonetheless.

116
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,520
Through mental strength.

117
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,190
But I reached a limit.

118
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,620
When I was thinking to myself...

119
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,990
that I can't endure any longer and how my life is falling apart...

120
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,810
Lightning struck.

121
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,720
Are you saying inspiration struck like lightning?

122
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,770
In this world,

123
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:37,670
miracles that cannot be explained through words happen.

124
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,470
I think a miracle like that happened to me.

125
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,170
He's so genuine.

126
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,630
Despite the time crunch, your thorough historical research is evident throughout.

127
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,680
Do you have special know-how in your research process?

128
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,570
Nothing special.

129
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,900
I researched relevant books, the internet, and libraries.

130
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,100
I interviewed people, too.

131
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,380
You must have so much material. Would you be willing to share your research notes?

132
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,710
Research notes that Author Jeong Yoo Seon recently shared are the talk of the town.

133
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,150
That will be difficult. I'm not very organized. Plus, it's considered a trade secret as well.

134
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,610
That's too bad.

135
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,620
By the way, is the piece based on a real-life incident?

136
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,140
 A popular book YouTuber suggested that the book might be based on a real incident. 

137
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm not sure if there was a similar incident,

138
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,000
but the narrative of the piece is fiction stemming from my imagination.

139
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,260
Lightning, miracle...

140
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,600
All your answers were cliche sentimentality void of any logic whatsoever.

141
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,090
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

142
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,890
You'd never understand such sentimentality.

143
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,590
Let go of your bias.

144
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,600
It's prejudice based on your inferiority complex that deems the poor as good and the rich as evil.

145
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,140
Sure, thanks for your advice.

146
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,280
Hey, an author should've logically analyzed and explained his own piece.

147
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,340
That's the job of critics.

148
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,020
CEO Lee.

149
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,500
They want to take a photo of you and Author Yook.

150
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,420
- Okay. 
 - Why?

151
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,800
Sure, why not.

152
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,000
Please politely decline the request.

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,800
The author is the main character here.

154
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,880
Yes.

155
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,830
I'm leaving.

156
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,400
Apologize before you leave.

157
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,370
I understand why you did that.

158
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,830
But expressing inferiority through violence is embarrassing and childish for an intellectual.

159
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,430
You could just say you're mad I beat you up. Therefore, apologize.

160
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,280
You sure say it in such a roundabout way.

161
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I threw a punch, too. And you were hit, too.

162
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,470
Then we're even.

163
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,350
I acted in self-defense.

164
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,520
Fine, I'm sorry I punched you first. Happy?

165
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,070
Is that a real apology?

166
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,420
I understand where you're coming from.

167
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,710
You must want to squash your jealousy and your

168
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,870
inferiority complex as a writer using your money.

169
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,400
But as an intellectual, you shouldn't do that.

170
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,910
Me, jealous of you?

171
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,350
Geez. That's ridiculous.

172
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,850
Hey, I'm the one who made you a writer. Did you forget?

173
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,990
See?

174
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,070
Trying to squash me with your money right now? Where did you learn such bad habits?

175
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,000
Hey, Yook Dong Joo.

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,270
- I don't need your apology. 
 - What?

177
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,520
Let's say the scratch I made on your fancy face will suffice

178
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,800
instead of you apologizing for mocking my mom.

179
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm leaving, you punk.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,690
Get over yourself.

181
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,720
Right back at you.

182
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,210
That punk. Right back, back at you.

183
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,910
   

184
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,680
The designated driver left

185
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,740
because Shin Kyeong Cheol's car was gone by the time he arrived.

186
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,100
- Did you know that? 
 - No.

187
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,200
Did that happen?

188
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,870
Yes.

189
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,770
Why are you sharing that now?

190
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,410
I simply thought the designated driver company had made a mistake.

191
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,340
You simply thought?

192
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,990
When it's a murder case?

193
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,560
I didn't know Director Shin would be murdered then.

194
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,050
I'm getting chills.

195
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,670
That means the perpetrator was watching here the whole time.

196
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,080
You saw the perpetrator's face when you gave him the car key. Right?

197
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,380
As I told you last time, I didn't see his face because he was masked.

198
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,200
That son of a bitch perp was one step ahead.

199
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,730
Is that possible?

200
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,800
It would've been possible if he was closely trailing Shin Kyeong Cheol.

201
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,600
It must've been tricky to perfect the timing of calling a designated driver.

202
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,490
- What if he has an accomplice? 
 - An accomplice?

203
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:10,560
If a Fortuna employee was an accomplice, they could've quickly contacted the perpetrator.

204
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,090
Are you thinking of anyone in particular?

205
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,900
Someone does come to mind, but we should look into it.

206
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,600
Did you find any connections between Shin Kyeong Cheol and Jeon Doo Hyeon?

207
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,810
Nothing special.

208
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,070
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

209
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,220
No CCTV footage because he went missing two months ago, and no witnesses.

210
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,160
How come finding a single piece of evidence is this hard?

211
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,680
We have results from the forensic analysis.

212
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,150
What does it say?

213
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,460
The wood pieces found in Shin Kyeong Cheol's and Jeon Doo Hyeon's bodies

214
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,560
are identical in material.

215
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,130
- Park Hyeon Soo. 
 - Yes.

216
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,070
Share all the records on Jeon Doo Hyeon's case from two years ago.

217
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,500
- Got it. 
 - All right.

218
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,800
Remember, the perp of these two cases could be the same person.

219
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,300
Back to the drawing board. Stay sharp.

220
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,120
There's also Na Sang Woo, who's missing.

221
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,000
That's a mere conjecture. No body has been found.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,260
- Don't get ahead of yourself. 
 - Yes.

223
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,330
Don't say a word to the reporters.

224
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,560
As soon as someone says serial killer, everyone and their mothers will want in.

225
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,220
Especially you, blabbermouth.

226
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,190
Why are you picking on me?

227
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,390
What about Chairman Lee Tae Man?

228
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,460
- He only agreed to written responses. 
 - Geez...

229
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,960
He treats the police like shit just because he's a chairman.

230
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll try to push through.

231
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,390
No, get a written response first.

232
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,040
He is a corporation chairman, after all.

233
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,370
We better act like we're treating him as such.

234
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,080
   

235
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,370
This is Park Hyeon Soo.

236
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,510
Who is this?

237
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,590
    
 Yes, Doctor.

238
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,700
No.

239
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,200
    
 Is the patient conscious?

240
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Really?

241
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,140
That's a relief.

242
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,240
Yes.

243
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,620
He doesn't remember anything yet.

244
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:10,610
I was curious if the police are looking for the patient's family.

245
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,700
 [Fall Prevention Tips 

246
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,610
Who are you?

247
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,580
Are you okay to walk around?

248
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,980
Do you know me?

249
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,620
I was the police in charge of your car crash incident.

250
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,990
Hello.

251
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,580
I have... moved departments.

252
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,580
   

253
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,980
   

254
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,370
 Oh, my god! 

255
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,440
Who...

256
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,460
Huh? Park...

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,800
He must look fine on the outside

258
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,470
but he's still a patient, so he gets cold easily.

259
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,000
He gets cold all the time.

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,770
It's likely PTSD from the car accident.

261
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,470
So, have you been well?

262
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,520
Yes.

263
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,500
When you got into the car accident, she's the one—

264
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,900
I heard.

265
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,000
You heard? I see. Okay.

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm in the violent crimes division now.

267
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,800
- Oh, you moved departments? 
 - Yes.

268
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,400
Oh, I see.

269
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,970
So, what brings you here?

270
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,900
I heard you haven't found your family yet or your memories.

271
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,450
By chance... did you find his family?

272
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,140
I looked into it, but there are no missing person cases submitted.

273
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,130
What about putting up a banner near the accident site?

274
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,820
A-A banner?

275
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,270
With a photo of the victim and necessary information.

276
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,270
It could say he lost his memories after a car crash and is looking for his family.

277
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,910
Oh, got it.

278
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,280
I hadn't thought of that.

279
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,080
You can list the police station's contact info or mine.

280
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
We can list my contact information.

281
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,300
I'm the temporary guardian.

282
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,460
Do what you both would like to do.

283
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,900
Let's list both.

284
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,290
Detective's number and yours too, Hyung.

285
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,200
The detective's busy. We can just list mine.

286
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,270
You might not always be able to pick up.

287
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,900
Don't worry. I'll pick up, no question.

288
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,350
I don't trust you. Your bag...

289
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,500
Fine, fine. We'll put both.

290
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Put her number, my number, and my address.

291
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,240
Happy? All good?

292
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,500
Wow, I'm so moved. You coming all the way here.

293
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,200
Giving us this wonderful idea.

294
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
The police are truly defenders of justice, the people's servants...

295
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
- I'll get going. 
 - Take care.

296
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,430
Thank you for the book.

297
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,450
Sorry?

298
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,550
Thank you.

299
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,410
What is she thanking me for?

300
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,630
Why are you so nervous?

301
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,410
What do you mean? Who's nervous?

302
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,630
You.

303
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,030
You looked nervous and awkward.

304
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,280
I was hurt. Hurt!

305
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,370
I didn't know you didn't trust me at all.

306
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:18,600
I've been trying so hard to protect your secret.

307
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,520
Is something wrong with Detective Park?

308
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,170
Did you feel something? Like pain or desperation?

309
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,130
They said I can check out.

310
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,120
Check out?

311
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,200
Dr. Lee Soo Yeon said I could stay at her house.

312
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,800
- Really? 
 - Yes.

313
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,180
That's great.

314
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,920
So I'm planning on staying at your house.

315
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,180
W-What are you talking about?

316
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,300
Why would I inconvenience her when you're responsible for me?

317
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,080
You're the perpetrator, so you're responsible for me.

318
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,190
That's beyond the responsibilities of a perpetrator.

319
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,360
There are no limits to the responsibilities of a perpetrator.

320
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,480
I do have a personal life, you know.

321
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,770
You said you were my temporary guardian.

322
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,300
That doesn't mean we live together.

323
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,970
I'm saying I'll stay there temporarily.

324
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,690
You said the doctor invited you to stay with her.

325
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,640
The doctor has a family. I don't want to inconvenience her.

326
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,090
And it's okay to inconvenience me?

327
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,570
You said you live alone.

328
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,730
Everyone is ultimately alone. Everyone has to withstand their life. Everyone has their own life.

329
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,760
You butted into my life.

330
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,900
You butted into my life. And how can a person be responsible for another person?

331
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,730
I can't even be responsible for my own life.

332
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,700
I never said to be responsible for my life.

333
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,710
Why in the world are you insisting on living with me?

334
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,840
I thought you didn't trust me.

335
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,710
I don't hear anything from you.

336
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,590
I don't see anything, and...

337
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,690
I don't hear anything.

338
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,540
So, it's comfortable to be with you.

339
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,430
I prefer rice to bread.

340
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,850
A-Are you asking me to cook for you?

341
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,180
I'll take bread every once in a while.

342
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,190
Let's go.

343
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,300
W-Where?

344
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,700
- The site of the car accident. 
 - Right now?

345
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,270
I might remember something if we go there.

346
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,780
And check out where to hang the banner, too.

347
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,740
W-Why are you so impatient?

348
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,600
The sooner I recover my memories, the better it is for you.

349
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,900
L-Let's first check out. We need to get permission to leave.

350
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,590
Already got permission.

351
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,100
You can't leave in your patient gown.

352
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,050
Y-You're going to wear that?

353
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,110
The doctor gifted me clothes and shoes.

354
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,300
F-Fine! L-L-Let's go.

355
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,500
And there's something you need to do.

356
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,560
All right, smile.

357
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,800
One, two, three.

358
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,920
What is this?

359
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
GPS Navigation.

360
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,000
- What's that? 
 - It's a device that guides the way.

361
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,100
That's why it has a map. Fascinating.

362
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,410
- You're more fascinating. 
 - Why?

363
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,440
You're a whiz kid armed with telepathy, psychokinesis, and mysterious superpowers.

364
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,900
Yet you're a super-dummy who doesn't know what a GPS is.

365
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,380
It's all because of you, Hyung.

366
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,220
It's because of the lightning.

367
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,500
I feel like I've heard the name Dong Joo before.

368
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,300
It's because of Yoon Dong Joo. It's familiar. 
  (Famous Korean poet) 

369
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
Fine.

370
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,350
What?

371
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,020
I'll just go to the shelter if you hate this so much.

372
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,380
I didn't say I hated it.

373
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,020
I'll check out tomorrow, then.

374
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm considering all my options right now.

375
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
Whether I should follow the old proverb to keep your enemies close.

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,100
- Am I the enemy? 
 - That was a figure of speech.

377
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,830
Wow!

378
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,390
There are so many buildings.

379
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,480
Why?

380
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,900
You're letting the fine dust in.

381
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,800
- What's fine dust? 
 - So, I mean...

382
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,100
Where have you been?

383
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,500
I went to see Jeon Doo Hyeon's wife.

384
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,220
And I dropped by somewhere on my way back.

385
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,340
Why did you meet with Jeon Doo Hyeon's wife?

386
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,600
I had a couple of questions.

387
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,540
Don't run wild without reporting back.

388
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,740
I got permission from Lieutenant Lee before I left.

389
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,290
If it weren't for you, Min Woo...

390
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,450
wouldn't have died like that.

391
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,900
All I did was do my job.

392
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,960
Oh, is your job to seduce married men?

393
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,330
You have nerves of steel. I'll give you that.

394
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,260
I can't believe you're back here.

395
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,460
I came here through an official appointment.

396
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,100
- If you ever do this to me again, I won't let it slide. 
 - Why?

397
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,950
- You'll tell on me to the higher-ups? 
 - Yes.

398
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,480
Hey!

399
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,280
   

400
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,260
   

401
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,440
Is anything coming to mind?

402
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,250
It feels familiar.

403
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,390
But a little unfamiliar.

404
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,830
What's that supposed to mean?

405
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,310
It's like you're saying you're dead yet alive.

406
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,980
There was an alleyway.

407
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,120
There was definitely an alleyway. Many houses, too.

408
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,850
It might be a memory from a different day.

409
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,800
It was raining, and there was thunder and lightning, too.

410
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,290
You said so, Hyung. It rained, and lighting struck on the day of the accident.

411
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,980
I did say that.

412
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:38,360
But look, there's no alleyway here. And this apartment building is under construction.

413
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,560
It's such a mystery the more I think about it.

414
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,360
Where did you pop out from?

415
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,340
Let's go already.

416
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,870
Are you sure this is the spot?

417
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,870
I'm sure.

418
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,000
Where did all the houses go?

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,850
It's not that the houses disappeared.

420
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,020
Your memory is warped.

421
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,680
When did the construction start?

422
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,210
It's been at least one year.

423
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,590
Don't try so hard.

424
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,630
Man lives in the present, not the past.

425
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,680
Whether you recover your memories or not, you're here alive. That's the important thing.

426
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,480
I need to find out who I am.

427
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,830
I don't even know who I am.

428
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,080
I was born in this neighborhood.

429
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,700
I was too little to remember anything.

430
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,580
This is your hometown?

431
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,110
Yes.

432
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,600
After my dad died, we moved to a neighborhood nearby.

433
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,300
That day, the accident happened on my way back from seeing my mom.

434
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,220
But I don't have any memories of this neighborhood.

435
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,200
It means nothing to me.

436
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,040
To have no memories means it means nothing.

437
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,920
Does that mean I mean nothing?

438
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,720
That's a big leap.

439
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm just saying the present is more important than the past.

440
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,530
Hey, get in.

441
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,180
Are you craving anything?

442
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,090
You must be sick of the hospital food.

443
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,010
Tell me anything you want.

444
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,760
You haven't forgotten about the names of the dishes. Right?

445
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,960
W-What's going on now?

446
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,420
   

447
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,990
Huh?

448
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,980
What is it?

449
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,860
W-W-What's going on?

450
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,550
Why? Why? Why?

451
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,150
Why?

452
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,420
Hey! Where are you going?

453
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,030
Gosh, really.

454
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,380
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.

455
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,910
Hey!

456
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,250
What is this?

457
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,120
Why? What now?

458
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,590
Huh?

459
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,870
What is this?

460
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,360
Hold on, hold on.

461
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,950
What is this?

462
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,350
What? Where did he go?

463
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,810
Huh?

464
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,440
Hey, kid.

465
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,990
Wake up.

466
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,380
Come with me. Wake up.

467
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,620
Please open your eyes.

468
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,330
Wake up.

469
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,630
Geez...

470
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,190
Excuse me. Sir!

471
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,550
Sir!

472
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,990
Hold on a minute.

473
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,050
Goodness...

474
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,940
Excuse me. By any chance,

475
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,890
that graffiti over there, do you know who did it?

476
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,560
No.

477
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,850
My goodness.

478
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,040
Where in the world did he go?

479
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,890
Is anyone there?

480
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,380
Help me!

481
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,290
I need help! Is anyone there?

482
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,010
Please open.

483
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,240
Open!

484
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,170
Over here!

485
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,380
Is anyone there? Please help!

486
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,220
Is anyone there? Please help!

487
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,680
 Open the door! 

488
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,810
 Open the door. 

489
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,840
 I said, open the door. 

490
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,820
 Please open it. 

491
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,860
 Open! 

492
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,960
 Open the door. 

493
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,750
 Open it. Please open the door. 

494
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,510
 Is anyone out there? 

495
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,050
 Open the door! 

496
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
 

497
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,360
 I'm sorry. 

498
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,080
 I'm sorry, little brother. 

499
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,840
Brother.

500
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,710
Geez. Whatever! If he has superpowers, he'll come back on his own.

501
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,650
Geez.

502
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,870
Damn it.

503
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,700
 Brother. 

504
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,920
 Brother. 

505
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
- Where are you? 
   - Help me. 

506
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,880
Where are you right now?

507
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,970
Huh?

508
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:34,430
I can't help you if I don't know where you are!

509
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,170
Hey, victim!

510
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,720
Hey!

511
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,940
Where are you?

512
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,840
I can get out of here.

513
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,420
I will get out of here.

514
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,620
Hey, kid.

515
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,630
Wake up. Open your eyes.

516
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,940
Excuse me! Hello!

517
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,910
I need to ask you a question.

518
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,380
Do you want to die?

519
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,040
Who are you?

520
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,480
   

521
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,380
Where are you?

522
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,660
Can you hear my voice?

523
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,800
 If you can hear me, answer me. 

524
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,630
P-Please, let me live...

525
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,200
Let me live...

526
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,230
Please let me live...

527
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,700
Please...

528
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,430
Die.

529
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,700
You are not even human.

530
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,300
Die.

531
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,490
I'm here now!

532
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,430
If you can hear me, answer!

533
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,850
Hey, victim!

534
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,070
 It's me, I said! 

535
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,760
   

536
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,750
Hey, hey! What's wrong? What happened?

537
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,140
- Let's go to the hospital. 
 - Hospital? Hurry!

538
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,420
 Help me. 

539
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,600
 There's someone in here! 

540
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,580
 Help me! 

541
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,590
   

542
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,200
 Help me! 

543
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,900
   

544
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,400
My goodness. Thank you so much.

545
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,610
This guy here is special.

546
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:54,020
We needed an ally. I heard you knew, Doctor.

547
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,920
If you had been a little late, his life would have been in danger.

548
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,510
Hyung saved him.

549
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,000
Hey, come on...

550
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
- I'll go upstairs. 
 - Sure.

551
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,960
I'll be going, too.

552
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,500
Hold on a minute.

553
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,090
 I'm sorry. 

554
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,600
 I am so sorry. 

555
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,860
There are scars on his back.

556
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,320
Scars?

557
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
They seem like old scars.

558
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,080
My guess is...

559
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,500
I think he was abused as a child.

560
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,100
I see.

561
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,030
Maybe that's why his family isn't looking for him.

562
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,670
Maybe.

563
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,560
Oh my god...

564
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,110
Golly, golly, golly gosh.

565
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,110
Oh my goodness! My body aches.

566
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,090
My body aches. Good god.

567
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,420
Gosh, I'm so exhausted because of you.

568
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,510
You are such a good liar.

569
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,870
To the cop earlier.

570
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,760
"The graffiti I found randomly really bothered me.

571
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,400
Using the mailbox in the graffiti as a clue, I looked for the child's house."

572
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,620
It's true.

573
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,380
"The front door happened to be open, so I went in.

574
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,520
And I heard the child moaning from a room.

575
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,830
But it was locked."

576
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,650
So, was I supposed to say, "A superhero with amnesia sensed an abused child's suffering from graffiti,

577
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,400
and transported himself to save the kid?" Huh?

578
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,960
Like they would believe that.

579
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,120
They would call me crazy.

580
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,720
You're not making any sense.

581
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,360
His mother saw everything.

582
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,290
No matter what she says, they won't believe her.

583
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,770
Would you believe her?

584
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,540
I tried to kill her.

585
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,460
What are you talking about?

586
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,500
His mother.

587
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,500
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep early.

588
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,840
All right, all right! Okay.

589
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,730
Let's leave tomorrow.

590
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,460
I'll come pick you up, so be ready.

591
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,160
Am I going to your house?

592
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,060
It's not like the perpetrator has any powers.

593
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,240
The victim's requests must be fulfilled.

594
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,690
We'll figure everything out after you're discharged.

595
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,790
Let's give you a name, too.

596
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,970
A name?

597
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,420
    
 It's so inconvenient because I don't know what to call you.

598
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,890
Does your phone have a camera?

599
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,510
I can watch a movie on it, too. Hey, Yong Dae.

600
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,210
Wow, that's so cool.

601
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,210
Do you know him?

602
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,250
I can't see his face.

603
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,450
If you knew him, you'd recognize him even with his face covered.

604
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,260
I don't know him. But where did you get this?

605
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,460
The video phone on your front door has this function.

606
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,710
If someone rings the bell or tries the keypad, it automatically captures the screen and records the date and time.

607
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,870
- Oh, I had no idea.
 - Geez. So what are you missing ?   - Huh? 

608
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:46,010
Didn't he steal something? That's why you installed the CCTV.

609
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,330
Nothing's missing.

610
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:48,560
Nothing?

611
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,760
No, nothing.

612
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,360
But how did he figure out the passcode?

613
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,220
That's why you shouldn't use your birthday.

614
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,550
First, let's fill out a report.

615
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,310
No, it's okay.

616
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,410
Don't do it.

617
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,140
We need to catch him.

618
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,590
I'm not missing anything.

619
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,740
He's dangerous. He might break in again.

620
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,920
I already changed the passcode, and installed the CCTV. It's fine.

621
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,820
I'll take care of everything.

622
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,230
I'll file a report and look at all the CCTVs in this neighborhood.

623
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,710
If I want to find him, I will.

624
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,230
What's wrong?

625
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,620
What do you mean?

626
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,170
I don't get it.

627
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,700
This bastard figured out your passcode. Plus, if he wasn't a thief, he had another motive.

628
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,540
I don't want to make a fuss.

629
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,540
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

630
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,300
- I-I'm not. 
 - Look me in the eyes.

631
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,280
Geez! Come on, stop it.

632
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,790
I got it!

633
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,210
He's a stalker, isn't he?

634
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,290
What?

635
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,620
I have a feeling. It's a superfan of yours.

636
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,670
Wow, this is what it's like to be famous.

637
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,610
As soon as you become a hit writer, you get a stalker.

638
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,930
We need to find him.

639
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,660
Stalkers are even more dangerous.

640
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,160
Actually, I spoke with him on the phone.

641
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,170
You talked to him?

642
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,820
He called you?

643
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,880
Yeah.

644
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,400
What did he say?

645
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,880
He doesn't like the ending.

646
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,020
He said the novel shouldn't have come out.

647
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,630
What a crazy bastard.

648
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,940
He said he'd never do it again.

649
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,860
Let's just let it go quietly.

650
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,320
This is not the kind of thing to let go of.

651
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,190
I promised him, so let's let it go.

652
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,100
How can you trust a crazy bastard? Let me handle it.

653
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,650
I said it was fine.

654
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,630
I mean...

655
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,580
I don't want people to talk about it.

656
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,730
He seems dangerous. Keep an eye on him.

657
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,700
Okay. Don't worry.

658
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,780
All kinds of things happen when you get famous.

659
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,820
Right.

660
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,300
Oh, by the way, your book is the number one bestseller.

661
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,400
Even your mom is a celebrity in her neighborhood.

662
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,390
I see...

663
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,800
Excuse me. Could you ring me up?

664
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,600
Did you enjoy your meal?

665
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,500
You said it was good, but you didn't eat much.

666
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,930
You did that last time, too.

667
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,900
You're working late today.

668
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,180
I have the evening shift.

669
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,510
My son keeps telling me to stop working,

670
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,690
but I get bored if I just stay home.

671
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,560
Your author son, you mean?

672
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,950
Did I tell you last time?

673
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,080
Yes.

674
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,840
He's number one.

675
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,690
On the bestseller list.

676
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,980
Congratulations.

677
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,440
He's just like his father. He was born with the talent of writing.

678
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,680
His father loved books.

679
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,650
See you next time.

680
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:47,240
Get home safely.

681
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,580
   

682
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,480
   

683
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,790
   

684
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,870
This is not a coincidence.

685
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,730
Sang Woo is missing.

686
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,780
Kyeong Cheol was murdered.

687
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,250
And now, Doo Hyeon.

688
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,720
It can't be a coincidence.

689
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,160
And if it's not?

690
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,200
It has to do with what happened.

691
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,800
What happened?

692
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,260
What happened 27 years ago.

693
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,530
Don't be so oversensitive.

694
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,400
Kyeong Cheol was found in Lake Sopyeong.

695
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,010
Lake Sopyeong.

696
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,480
I know that.

697
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,910
Then how can you think it's a coincidence?

698
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,450
Are you sure he's dead?

699
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,830
Who?

700
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,710
Lee Ha Neul.

701
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,470
I said, are you sure?

702
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,670
I already answered.

703
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,170
Double-check with your father.

704
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,900
If I say I'm sure, it's for sure.

705
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,940
What are you guys doing?

706
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:13,360
Back then and now... I see nothing has changed.

707
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,890
Stop fighting and be nice to each other.

708
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,810
Your friend is dead.

709
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,510
Try grieving, too.

710
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,280
What do you think?

711
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,380
Do you think all this is a coincidence?

712
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,460
It's strange for a coincidence, sure.

713
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,640
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

714
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,640
Don't call up my girls outside of here.

715
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,120
Okay, Chairman Lee?

716
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,860
And bring Myeong Seok around sometime.

717
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,100
I miss him.

718
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,600
Myeong Seok isn't like me. He doesn't like places like this.

719
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,280
Maybe because his mother was from a place like this.

720
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,770
I think it reminds him of his mom.

721
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,950
You still care where people are from, I see.

722
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,440
You can't hide blood.

723
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:23,200
That girl is sometimes so sexy.

724
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:05,070
 A man passing by last night discovered graffiti on the walls. 

725
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,830
 One might not think too much of this drawing, 

726
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,710
but it was a cry for help from a child who was being abused.

727
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:16,380
Abused and neglected by his mother, he was locked up in a semi-basement.

728
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,080
A six-year-old boy with the last name Kim.

729
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,690
 Kim was locked inside a home full of mold and garbage, 

730
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:26,770
 barely surviving on snacks that his mother brought once a week 

731
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,300
 while she left him behind and stayed with her boyfriend nearby. 

732
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,030
 From years of abuse, 

733
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,950
 Kim's body was covered in bruises of various sizes. 

734
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:40,910
 He was malnourished to the point of near death. 

735
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:46,100
 The brave man who did not just ignore his desperate cry for help 

736
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,620
 is Yook Dong Joo, the debut writer of "God Is Dead." 

737
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,780
 Yook was doing field research for his next book 

738
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,370
 when he saw the child's graffiti and had suspicions. 

739
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,330
 The mother, whose last name is Jang, is at the local station 

740
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,620
 being investigated on charges of child abuse and neglect. 

741
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,840
 Showing mental instability, she is refusing to answer questions. 

742
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,650
Your future is all set. I'm so jealous.

743
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,670
All set? No.

744
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:19,350
Of course, it is. Your son is a successful writer, and a hero who is on the news.

745
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,350
I am really proud of him for that.

746
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,720
Honestly, I think honor is more important than money.

747
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,000
But money is important, too.

748
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,660
Dong Joo has always had a sense of justice since he was little. So kind and honest.

749
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,970
He must get that from his father.

750
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,700
I'm so happy these days that I can't sleep. It's great.

751
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,560
Must be.

752
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,810
I'm so happy that I'm not sure if I'm allowed to be this happy.

753
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:42,030
I don't want anything more.

754
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,220
My gosh...

755
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,140
CEO Lee.

756
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,900
The book sales are out of this world.

757
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,600
Interview requests are pouring in like crazy.

758
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,440
All right.

759
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,560
Readers are blowing up the phone with their support.

760
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:02,150
Mr. Yook is so amazing. How did he get that from graffiti?

761
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,160
Did you get him on the phone?

762
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,830
No, he's not answering.

763
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,690
- I'll try him again. 
 - No, it's all right. I'll do it.

764
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,980
I just woke up. What's up?

765
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,710
Have you seen the news?

766
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,040
What news?

767
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,300
You hate interviews, yet you do something interview-worthy.

768
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,250
How am I supposed to understand this?

769
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,750
Did you schedule another interview?

770
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,760
I told you I don't want to. I don't want to!

771
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,180
Are you kidding?

772
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,340
Are you kidding!

773
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:52,770
You deserve praise for saving a kid's life, but stop being such a hypocrite. If you keep...

774
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,240
H-Hello?

775
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,450
This bastard...

776
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,450
He hung up on me again.

777
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:06,780
 The brave man who did not just ignore his desperate cry for help 

778
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,680
 is Yook Dong Joo, the debut writer of "God Is Dead." 

779
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,940
My gosh, I'm going crazy.

780
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,300
I begged them not to release my name.

781
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,670
Geez, seriously! I'll go mad. I can't be more famous.

782
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,500
What's this...

783
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,300
   

784
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,870
   

785
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,650
   

786
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,240
   

787
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,400
What's going on all of a sudden?

788
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,500
Why did you send this book to me?

789
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,150
I didn't send that to you.

790
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,100
- You didn't send it to me? 
 - No.

791
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,450
I don't even know your address, Detective Park.

792
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,680
Excuse me.

793
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,400
What is going on?

794
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,340
How did you write this novel?

795
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,550
Is it based on a real case?

796
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,460
By chance...

797
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,340
do you know me?

798
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,070
You look so much like someone I know.

799
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,500
I was mistaken.

800
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,670
I'm sorry.

801
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,240
   

802
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,560
Hold on a minute.

803
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,840
Hold on a minute!

804
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,570
The murder in your book is happening in real life.

805
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,140
W-What did you say?

806
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,430
There's a case going on too similar to the story to be a coincidence.

807
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,580
Don't you know me?

808
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,700
The person who looks like me...

809
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,000
Isn't it me?

810
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,740
No.

811
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,460
He couldn't be so young.

812
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,330
Why not?

813
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,220
He's the same age as me.

814
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,520
The stories in this novel.

815
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,800
Did you come up with all of them, Mr. Yook?

816
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,800
Did you really write this novel, Mr. Yook?

817
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:57,290

823
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,870
 Is it a crime to have an imagination? 

824
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,290
 Maybe it's not from your imagination. 

825
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,480
 So, you mean that I'm the suspect. 

826
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,430
 It's similar, down to the details of the crime scene 

827
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,100
 and the murder method, that only police know. 

828
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,900
 That young man. Is he alive? 

829
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:36,960
 - Kang San! 
 - He's missing. 

830
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,820
 He's missing. 

831
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,600
 It's likely that he's dead. 

832
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,900
 Hey, I could get details on a case from 27 years ago. Right? 

833
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,130
 Crazy fucker. 

834
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,740
 What in the world did he do? 

835
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,250
 What are you hiding? 

836
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,060
 What the hell happened 27 years ago? 

837
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,140
 Good to see you. 

838
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,880
 Hold on. You... 

839
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,080
 Did you really mean to kill her? 

840
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,600
 I told you. I tried to kill her. 

841
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:09,630
