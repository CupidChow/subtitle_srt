1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,920


2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,980
You attend church?

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,520
I don't believe in God.

4
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,050
- Even so, how could you do this? 
 - The police will be here soon. Right?

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,820
Yeah.

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,280
Anyway, if everything you just said is true, extenuating circumstances will be considered.

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,550
The police in charge will be here soon, so trust them and... By the way, where did he go?

8
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,640
Yong Dae...

9
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,630
you said you'd understand no matter what I say. Right?

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,160
   

11
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,960
Senior.

12
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,450
   

13
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,660
Take him in.

14
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,000
- Sergeant Jeong Yong Dae. 
 - Sir.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,600
There was a command to stand by.

16
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,620
Well, the situation was... I'm sorry, Sir.

17
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,910
Good job.

18
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,090
Don't mention it, Sir.

19
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,650
Sir...

20
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,140
I have something to tell you.

21
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,360
You should go to the hospital to get treated—

22
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,610
I'll also... go to the police station.

23
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,430
All of this was my plan.

24
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,510
Mister is innocent.

25
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,490
Are you saying you planned the abduction scenario?

26
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,130
Yes.

27
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,100
 I shouldn't be here right now. 

28
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,460
 - What do you mean? 
 - I can't explain how I came here, nor would they believe me even if I could. 

29
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,210
 - Again, with the supernatural talk? 
 - I know. 

30
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,330
 I know it doesn't make sense, but it's true. 

31
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,330
 It's true. 

32
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,060
 And... the detectives are honed in on me because of my novel. 

33
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,910
 - What's that about now? 
 - There's no time to explain. 

34
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,770
 But I can guarantee if I stay here, 

35
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,290
 it won't be helpful... to either of us. 

36
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,570
 - Explain, so I can understand! 
 - I said, there's no time. 

37
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,530
I'll explain everything later. Okay?

38
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,580
 Go on, then. 

39
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,300
 The police will be here soon. 

40
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,130
 Okay. 

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,020
 I'm sorry for... calling you stupid. 

42
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,030
 But don't get your hopes up. 

43
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,590
 I can't guarantee I'll be able to clear your name. 

44
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,050
 But I'll do my best. 

45
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,710
 I'll look for any evidence I can. 

46
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,110
 So... you do your best to stay well, too. 

47
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,150
 Don't get mistreated and don't hold back if you think something's not right. 

48
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,210
 Tear at them like a dog. Ram yourself into them! 

49
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,130
 Maintain a "kill or be killed" mindset and just... 

50
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,830
 try to stay well. 

51
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,970
 I'll get going. 

52
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,160
 I'm off. 

53
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,180
Wait a minute.

54
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,980
   
 (Sounds like Gi Jeok, which means miracle.) 

55
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,550
Gosh, where did he disappear to?

56
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,070
That area is under redevelopment, so it's usually empty. But that building had its lights on.

57
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,920
So I went in to check it out and discovered the two of them.

58
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,190
The woman's face was injured, so I first suspected assault.

59
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,090
But they both said no. So I just left since nothing was out of the ordinary.

60
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,510
I made the report after getting the emergency alert text on my way back.

61
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,940
Why did you go in alone?

62
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,480
- You were told to standby. 
 - What's the problem?

63
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,820
It's enough that he convinced him to turn himself in.

64
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,000
Why didn't you move according to the manual?

65
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,200
Of course, I was going to stand by. But the victim could've been in danger

66
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,630
and I already met the assailant previously and determined I'd be able to subdue him on my own.

67
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,750
But there was no need to subdue him.

68
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,230
Noh Myeong Nam didn't fight back or resist at all and readily followed my commands.

69
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,210
The female victim was actually worried about Noh Myeong Nam.

70
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,020
Of course, she was.

71
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,500
Since they planned this together.

72
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,520
So, Noh Myeong Nam just willingly confessed after all that?

73
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,570
No, the woman was the one who confessed.

74
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,430
Good job.

75
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,580
You have to write a statement as a material witness, so come at your convenience.

76
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,620
All right.

77
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,830
   

78
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,730
You read this book?

79
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,330
- I skimmed through. 
 - You can't skim through this.

80
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,820
This is a masterpiece.

81
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,520
- Masterpiece, my foot. 
 - It's truly a masterpiece!

82
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,960
- The author of this book is my— 
  - And... 

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,570
 the detectives are honed in on me because of my novel. 

84
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,820
I'll get going.

85
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,760
Take care.

86
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,370
Hold on...

87
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,400
Hold on...

88
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,630
 The videotape. 

89
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,390
 I realized this after reading the novel. 

90
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,930
 "Oh, those bastards were recording a video at the time." 

91
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,410
Videotape...

92
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,390
 Mister is a detective. You've seen me before. Right? 

93
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,090
 What's in there? 

94
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,560
 It's a secret you saw me. Okay? 

95
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,990
 That tape. 

96
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,650
 You have it, don't you? You watched it! 

97
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,430
The videotape...

98
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,390
The video...

99
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,050
They were looking for that videotape, both then and now.

100
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,430
Which means they don't have the tape in their hands, either.

101
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,550
Why was he looking for the tape in my house 27 years ago?

102
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,610
   

103
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,780
 I have a favor to ask. 

104
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,610
 The only person I can trust... is you, Mister. 

105
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,550
 There's a videotape inside the bag. 

106
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,390
 Everything that happened that day is in it. 

107
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,740
   

108
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,900
   

109
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,770
   

110
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,730
 Mister, it's me. It's Kang San! 

111
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,140
 Did something bad happen to my brother? 

112
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,410
 No. 

113
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,920
 What about Brother? Where is he? 

114
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,440
 Your brother ran into a slight problem. 

115
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,760
 What problem? 

116
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,440
 Don't be too worried. 

117
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,020
  I will resolve it. Until then... don't tell anyone that your brother contacted you. 

118
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,590
 I need to know if it's about Brother. 

119
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,760
 Please tell me. 

120
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,270
 Kang San, listen carefully to what I say. 

121
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,190
 From now on, you can't trust anyone. 

122
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,980
 Not the detectives, the director, nor anyone. 

123
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,900
 All right. 

124
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,830
 And clear out your belongings at the orphanage tomorrow and stay at my place until your brother returns. 

125
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,210
 I'll explain it to the missus. 

126
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,390
 Dong Joo will like that, too. 

127
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 Anyone there? 

128
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,630
   

129
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,180
 Who is it? 

130
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,410
 It's the police. 

131
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,160
 Just a minute! 

132
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,030
 Go out the back door. 

133
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
 Hurry! 

134
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,890
   

135
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,030
 Open the door! It's the police! 

136
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,340
 Don't trust anyone. 

137
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,460
 You must not trust anyone. 

138
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,020
 Go straight to my house. 

139
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,440
 You mustn't go to the orphanage. 

140
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,790
 Go on. Hurry! 

141
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,170
   
 What are you doing? Open the door. 

142
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,180
Yeah, it's me, Mom.

143
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,420
I just got home.

144
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,480
I had a few sips of makgeolli after work.

145
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,920
You're acting really strange.

146
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,910
Why do you keep asking about Dad today?

147
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,270
That's odd.

148
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,720
Nothing. I thought I turned off the lights, but they're on.

149
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,010
Oh, my legs.

150
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,000
What? A tape?

151
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,190
- What tape? 
 - A videotape.

152
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,410
Not of a movie. A tape of an actual recording.

153
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,100
It's smaller than a music tape— Wait, I don't know the specific size.

154
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,040
Anyway, wasn't it in any of Dad's belongings?

155
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,210
How can I remember that when I can hardly remember your dad's face?

156
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,690
Even if it existed, do you think we'd still have it?

157
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,060
We moved multiple times, and I've never seen it.

158
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,250
Run through your memories one more time.

159
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,870
You've never seen it while clearing out the bookstore?

160
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,600
This is important. Yeah, it's very important.

161
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,300
Why is that important?

162
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,820
Did you record a weird video?

163
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,160
Geez, what are you imagining? It's not like that.

164
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,470
Mom, think about it carefully.

165
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,730
It's likely to have been in Dad's belongings or at the bookstore.

166
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,050
They were all books. And a few music tapes.

167
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,600
I threw most of them out.

168
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,680
Did you throw it out because it was mixed with the music tapes?

169
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,980
 I don't know! 

170
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,090
You never know, so take a look around the house.

171
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,530
 You're in trouble, aren't you? 

172
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,960
What trouble?

173
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,820
Nothing's wrong.

174
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,580
Nothing! The only problem I have is being too successful.

175
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,770
Being successful is good. What are you complaining about?

176
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm tired. Let's hang up.

177
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,980
Make sure to look for it.

178
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,110
All right.

179
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,760
- Wait, Mom! Mom, Mom! 
 - What?

180
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,290
Make sure to lock your doors. You always leave them unlocked.

181
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,220
Look at you worrying about me.

182
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,920
Bye.

183
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,430
Wait a minute.

184
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,260
I think someone asked me about a videotape back then, too.

185
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,330
Who was it?

186
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,600
Oh, right! The pastor. The pastor at the time—

187
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,140
That little...

188
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,870
Th-That... That person!

189
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,750
Th-That...

190
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,200
35... M897235!

191
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,930
M897235, M897235, M897235...

192
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,970
Yook Dong Joo's looking for the tape, too?

193
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,730
All right.

194
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,720
How amusing.

195
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,930
How in the world did he know and write the novel?

196
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,180
Don't you think so, Father?

197
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,770
The novel is very realistic.

198
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,170
He described it as if he saw it himself.

199
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,710
It was so accurate I got the chills.

200
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,410
Is Ha Neul really alive?

201
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,540
I was certain he died back then.

202
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,180
You killed him, didn't you?

203
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,990
You should die. Now.

204
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,790
 You said we were going to Dong Joo Bookstore. 

205
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,290
 That's where Dong Joo Bookstore used to be. 

206
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,570
 Before it was taken down for redevelopment. 

207
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,830
 Where are we going? 

208
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,390
 The day you met my father. The day you got the bag was the day of the accident. Right? 

209
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,120
 - It's impossible, but my memory says so. 
 - Of course, it's impossible. 

210
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,550
 My father died in 1995, 

211
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,410
 and you're in 2022 right now. 

212
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,540
The year 2022...

213
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,720
   

214
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,820
   

215
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,690
   

216
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,730
That'll be 1,000 won.

217
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,490
What year is it right now?

218
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,530
- Right now? 
 - Are we in the year 2022?

219
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,320
Yes.

220
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,040
It's not 1995?

221
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,670
It's not.

222
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,190
Isn't this song "I Have No Problem"?

223
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,560
The song that's playing right now.

224
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,340
But you're saying it's 2022?

225
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,230
What are you trying to do here?

226
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,380
   

227
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,930
   

228
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,920
   

229
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,050
   
 What the heck! 

230
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,570
Hello?

231
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,470
That's you, right?

232
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,250
I couldn't make out the face, but I could tell it was you.

233
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,680
The hairstyle, height... and especially the creepy atmosphere. Right?

234
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,570
It's a secret.

235
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,180
Only I recognized you. Other kids probably couldn't tell.

236
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,580
They're saying it's fabricated. They don't believe it.

237
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,490
I believe it, though.

238
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,600
How was that recorded?

239
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,300
A YouTuber uploaded it.

240
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,900
What's a YouTuber?

241
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,150
What the heck?

242
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,170
Are you really an alien?

243
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,820
Yeah.

244
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,060
This won't do. We should meet up.

245
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,300
- Right now? 
 - Not right now. I'll contact you again.

246
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,310
Don't be too worried.

247
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,780
The video is trending, but he doesn't have many subscribers.

248
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,340
Anyway, I'll contact you again. Bye.

249
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,050
   

250
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,260
   

251
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,600
    
 Whoa.

252
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,190
Seriously, what is this?

253
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,430
No way.

254
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,330
Whoa.

255
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,900
   

256
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,180
   

257
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,740
   

258
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,860
 The past becomes the present and is alive and breathing. 

259
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,420
 The river and the mountain that embraced the sky 
 (Kang San = river and mountain, Ha Neul = sky) 

260
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,450
 are still alive and breathing today. 

261
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,510
   

262
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,880
   
   

263
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,070
   

264
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,610
   
   

265
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,460
   

266
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,820
 Look behind you. 

267
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,910
 Your friend always has your back. 

268
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,360
   

269
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,380
   

270
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,850
   

271
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,300
Where were you all this time? Why won't you pick up your phone?

272
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,700
You should at least pick up your phone after suddenly disappearing.

273
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,640
Where did you disappear to this time?

274
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,810
What does it matter to you?

275
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,560
Hey, what's wrong?

276
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,900
Do you know how worried I was about you?

277
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,940
You didn't have dinner and clearly didn't have money.

278
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,720
You don't know the streets, but I can't reach you—

279
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,220
Stop acting like you're my brother!

280
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,740
You're not even my real brother.

281
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,930
Hey, you punk...

282
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,370
How could you say that so coldheartedly?

283
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,250
We're family and brothers since we live together. And I'm your current guardian.

284
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,840
I don't need a guardian.

285
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,080
What's the matter with you?

286
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,550
What kind of family hides things and lies?

287
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,590
W-What exactly did I hide from you?

288
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,820
What happened at Lake Sopyeong?

289
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,470
It has something to do with me, doesn't it?

290
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,450
Is it fun?

291
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,550
What?

292
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,860
Is it fun playing with an idiot who can't remember his own name?

293
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,610
- You mean bastard! 
 - Watch what you say!

294
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,730
There's a reason I can't tell you right now. I'll tell you when the time is right!

295
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,070
We're facing so many hurdles—

296
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,840
"We?"

297
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,920
There's no "we" in your dictionary.

298
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,460
You only care about yourself.

299
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,410
 Which side are you? 

300
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,230
 The light or darkness? 

301
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,860
Mean bastard...

302
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,740
Yeah, I am a mean bastard.

303
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,320
   

304
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,570
   
   

305
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,840
Where did he go...

306
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,820
   

307
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,590
   

308
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,240
   

309
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,480
You're quite industrious.

310
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,860
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

311
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,170
You don't look sorry at all.

312
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,130
What do you need?

313
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,380
There's something I'm curious about.

314
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,500
Too much curiosity will turn you into a stalker.

315
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,880
He's doing well. Right?

316
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,960
That boy.

317
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,590
He has a name.

318
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,120
Gi Jeok. Lee Gi Jeok.

319
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,010
Lee Gi Jeok?

320
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,950
What is it you're curious about?

321
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,330
It's a mystery, no matter how I think about it.

322
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,360
No matter how incredible your imagination might be,

323
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,570
how could you describe an incident from 27 years ago so realistically and detailed?

324
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,710
Above all, it's even more fascinating how accurately you described the murders happening right now.

325
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:13,980
Your job as a detective is to suspect and my job as a writer is to imagine.

326
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,810
I have two hypotheses.

327
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,310
The first one, I don't know how you acquired it,

328
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,790
but you have the videotape of the murder scene 27 years ago.

329
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,090
The second one, you're acquainted with Lee Ha Neul.

330
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,290
Which one is it?

331
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:43,670
Gosh, another person is asking me which side I am.

332
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,280
It's the third one.

333
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,860
- The third one? 
 - I'm a time traveler.

334
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,720
Oh, there's a fourth one, too.

335
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,360
I have supernatural powers.

336
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,830
The ability to see the past and future.

337
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,760
There must be a fifth one, a sixth one, and so on.

338
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,750
There are.

339
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,680
There are, but...

340
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,220
let's talk about those next time. I'm a bit busy today.

341
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,490
Why didn't you ask?

342
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,770
- Ask what? 
 - You didn't ask who Lee Ha Neul is.

343
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,170
Well, it's probably someone related to the case.

344
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,500
Someone who has nothing to do with me.

345
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,450
But isn't it normal to ask who it is?

346
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,820
It isn't right to generalize everyone.

347
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,090
- You should leave. 
 - Wait!

348
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,990
Why did you lie?

349
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,550
- What lie? 
 - That boy, Lee Gi Jeok—

350
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,190
What's with Lee Gi Jeok? Is that a joke? Change it immediately. 
  ("Lee Gi Jeok" sounds like "selfish" in Korean.) 

351
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,350
It's just Gi Jeok, no surname. And he's the one who chose it.

352
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,050
- He chose it? 
 - Yes.

353
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,730
But what about Gi Jeok?

354
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,970
You said he had a bag on the day of the accident.

355
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,410
Is lying a habit of yours?

356
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,760
I just forgot about it. I was going to call you and explain—

357
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,660
And you had lost the bag at the time?

358
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,560
I think I'll continue to have more questions for you.

359
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,340
I'll see you again.

360
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,490
 Woo Jeong! 

361
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,770
 Here. 

362
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,380
 Again? 

363
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,740
 This one's yours. 

364
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,820
 - Give me that one. 
 - No. 

365
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,610
 It's going to melt. Take it. 

366
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,690
 You can't even get this right? It's lopsided every day. 

367
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,940
 Seeing every day is nice. 

368
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,170
 See what? 

369
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,360
 - What? 
 - Seeing what every day is nice? 

370
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,350
 What do you mean? 

371
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,730
 Me? 

372
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,610
♫  When I think about how tough it must be for you just like me  ♫

373
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,040
♫  My heart aches  ♫

374
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,350
♫  The fading sky reminds me of you  ♫

375
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:09,240
♫  Come back to me this once  ♫

376
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,070
♫  I'm afraid of being forgotten  ♫

377
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,920
♫  Us growing apart, our failed love  ♫

378
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,850
♫  This moment seems like a dream  ♫

379
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,630
♫  Not being able to see you again  ♫

380
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,500
♫  Not being able to call you again  ♫

381
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,570
♫  It hurts a little less, let's hang in there a bit longer  ♫

382
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,570
♫  All of your days  ♫

383
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,490
Hello.

384
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,270
Yes...

385
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,070
Hi.

386
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,360
I think the turnout will exceed our expectations.

387
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,580
It's the halo effect of winning the Korean Literature Award.

388
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,530
I thought of a congratulatory party for Writer Yook. Should we have one after the signing event?

389
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,870
No, we have other plans today. Let's do it next time.

390
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,840
CEO Lee Myeong Seok?

391
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,360
   

392
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,220
What brings you here?

393
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,700
To meet Writer Yook Dong Joo.

394
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,800
Oh, you're Yook Dong Joo's fan?

395
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,680
Not exactly a fan. Just curious.

396
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,520
We'll meet at Fortuna tonight with Hyungnim anyway. Why come all the way here?

397
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,520
A person's face is different during the day and night.

398
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,170
And I get to smell the books, feel the sun,

399
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,970
and see old faces while I'm at it.

400
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,820
I'll see you tonight.

401
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,360
   

402
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,600
Who is that?

403
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,760
We should head in, too.

404
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,910
   

405
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,330
- Hello. 
 - Yes.

406
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,630
- Your name? 
 - Cho Min Joo.

407
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes.

408
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,100
I love your sentences.

409
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,000
Thank you.

410
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:45,020
   

411
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,050
Okay, here you go.

412
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,120
Thank you...

413
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,630
   

414
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,330
- Hello, what's your name? 
 - Ahn Kyeong Sik.

415
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,770
 To Ahn Kyeong Sik, 

416
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:13,380
 being moderately happy is true happiness. 

417
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,090
 To Jeong Yong Hwa, 

418
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,490
 the truth is like a cursed doll. 

419
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,890
 Even if you throw it away, it'll appear... 

420
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,050
 again and again. 

421
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,450
 To Lee Joo Mi, 

422
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,020
 good fortune is sometimes a twisted habit of God's, 

423
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,200
 so be wary. 

424
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,570
   

425
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,870
   

426
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,440
- In middle school? 
 - Yes.

427
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,270
My name is Jeong Ah Reum.

428
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,540
- It must be nice... to be in middle school. 
 - Do you think so?

429
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,050
Of course, it is.

430
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,360
Although you wouldn't realize it now.

431
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,000
 To Jeong Ah Reum, I hope all your days are joyful, fun, and happy. 

432
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,550
 Being healthy is the best. 

433
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,000
   

434
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Here.

435
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,480
- What is this? 
 - Some guy asked me to give it to you.

436
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,100
   

437
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,130
   

438
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,950
Where's the person who gave you this?

439
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,640
Over there!

440
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,760
   

441
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,200
   

442
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,350
   

443
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,200
   

444
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,050
   

445
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,270
 You're here? 

446
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,920
 Did you finish? 

447
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,290
 I'm wrapping up. 

448
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,220
 Whoa, it's incredible. 

449
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,360
 Is it all right? 

450
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,440
 It's more than all right. It's like an artwork. 

451
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,610
 Artwork, my foot. 

452
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,420
 Dong Joo will love it. 

453
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,050
 I'm not sure. My son only likes cars. 

454
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,050
 Well, you made him a car, too. 

455
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,830
 Oh, and your exam? Did it go well? 

456
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,830
 I got it over with. 

457
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,280
 "Got it over with," meaning first place? 

458
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,470
 Oh, did you know this? 

459
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,310
 Horses possess the energy of both the sun and the moon, 

460
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,870
 symbolizing both sides at odds, like life and death. 

461
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,590
 I've never heard that before. 

462
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,730
 I also read it in a book. 

463
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,670
 Dad! 

464
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,660
 Goodness! Son, you're here? 

465
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,820
 - Where's mom? 
 - I'm late, so I'll get going. 

466
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,640
 I cooked food, so don't eat ramen. 

467
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,120
 - Don't worry, and get going. 
 - Okay. 

468
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,410
 Dong Joo, don't bother Dad and be a good boy. Okay? 

469
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,870
 You said you're late. Go on. 

470
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,710
 All right. 

471
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,080
 Hello. 

472
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,900
 - And you are? 
 - Taekang High School's valedictorian. 

473
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,760
 Oh! This is great. 

474
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,810
 I was going to ask you a favor if I met you. 

475
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,050
 - What favor? 
 - Hold on. 

476
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,820
 Please tutor our Dong Joo. Math and English. 

477
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,550
 The basics are important. 

478
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,800
 You're getting carried away. Get going. 

479
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,890
 I'll do it. 

480
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,640
 - You promised! 
 - Yes. 

481
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,240
 Don't let the briquette fire die off. 

482
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,420
 All right. 

483
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,280
 My mother-in-law is ill. 

484
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,120
 Your wife is quite cheerful. 

485
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,960
 She's overbearingly cheerful. 

486
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,020
 Oh, Dong Joo. 

487
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,070
 Say, hello. This is Brother Ha Neul. 

488
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,200
 Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Ha Neul. 

489
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,720
   

490
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,890
   

491
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,350
 Your name is the sky? 

492
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,370
 You're Yook Dong Joo, not Yoon Dong Joo. Right? 

493
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,550
 Yeah! 

494
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,680
 My name isn't that sky. It's Lee Ha Neul. 
 (Lee Ha Neul sounds like "this sky") 

495
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,020
 Right. 

496
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,750
 A gift. I carried it around, so I could give it to you. 

497
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,250
 Here. 

498
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,070
 Do you like it? 

499
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,820
Writer Yook.

500
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,860
   

501
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,980
Is there a problem?

502
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,020
O-Oh, oh! You see...

503
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:13,050
My b-back just hurts from s-sitting down too long.

504
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,080
Gosh, my back.

505
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,450
It feels a bit better now.

506
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,260
Yeah.

507
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,940
Oh, t-thank you.

508
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,250
- Hi, what's your name? 
 - Park No Jin.

509
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,170
   

510
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,800
   

511
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,250
   

512
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,910
Young lady!

513
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,230
There's something I want to ask you.

514
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,720
   

515
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,130
   
   

516
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,680
   
   

517
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,770
You can take it with you to read.

518
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,280
You can take that book.

519
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,470
It's okay.

520
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,870
And please speak comfortably.

521
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,760
Should I?

522
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,420
There's a "closed" sign outside. Did you come out because of me?

523
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,140
No, I had things to do, anyway.

524
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,320
That's a relief.

525
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,550
To be honest... I came because I had a favor to ask.

526
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,880
A favor?

527
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,250
The friend you said looks very similar to me...

528
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,880
I'd like to meet him.

529
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:21,280
That's too bad. I can't contact him.

530
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,510
If you don't have his number, do you know anyone who does?

531
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,600
That would be really great.

532
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,580
But no one does.

533
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,590
He disappeared.

534
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,690
What do you mean, disappeared?

535
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,610
The police said he ran away, but he didn't.

536
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,850
There's no way he would've left without telling me.

537
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:00,180
Even if he had no choice but to do that, he would've definitely contacted me later.

538
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,920
So, you never heard from him again?

539
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,830
Never, not even once.

540
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,600
You probably expected more.

541
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,260
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

542
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,990
It's all right.

543
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,500
But do I look like him that much?

544
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,130
Yes.

545
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,230
- I have a photo. 
 - A photo?

546
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,090
Hold on.

547
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,510
   

548
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,610
Tomorrow...

549
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,300
What's with you?

550
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,470
What about me?

551
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,590
You've been anxious and antsy the entire time. What's wrong?

552
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,170
- Hey, come on. 
 - Gosh, I'm sorry.

553
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,610
Who is that?

554
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,560
Who?

555
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,740
The thing in your pocket.

556
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,760
Who's the person who sent that note?

557
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,090
Is it blackmail or something?

558
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,410
- You even monitor me now? 
 - Well, you're acting suspicious.

559
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,380
Like a halfwit.

560
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,400
What are you doing?

561
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,930
Looking for a wiretap.

562
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,650
7:00 p.m. Don't be late.

563
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,760
What the? You forgot?

564
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,330
Oh! Your brother!

565
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:58,430
- That was today? 
 - He may be Brother to me, but it's Chairman to you.

566
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,890
You speak so immaturely without a hint of embarrassment.

567
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:06,710
Don't cross the line. If you do, you'll end up—

568
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,890
That bastard always ignores what I say.

569
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,850
I've already crossed the line.

570
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,080
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

571
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,570
   

572
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,340
Are you all right?

573
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,510
Gosh, I'm sorry.

574
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,750
I'll get you a new book—

575
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,160
Did you meet god?

576
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,940
- Sorry? 
 - Where is he?

577
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,340
Where can I meet him?

578
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,620
Excuse me, sir—

579
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,230
He's not dead.

580
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,710
God is alive. Right?

581
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,740
Yes, o-of course.

582
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,240
God exists everywhere.

583
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,730
Take care.

584
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,080
Whoa, w-what do you want?

585
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,450
Tell him... that I'm waiting.

586
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,600
Please let go of my arm first!

587
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,550
- I'm not crazy. 
 - I'm not calling you crazy.

588
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,540
Tell the person who wrote this novel...

589
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,920
that...

590
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,780
I've been waiting for 27 years.

591
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,490
What's going on?

592
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,390
What's wrong?

593
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,520
I'm sorry.

594
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,480
What's with that guy?

595
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
Do you know him?

596
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,250
I'm asking if you know him.

597
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,130
No.

598
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,700
What is he saying?

599
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,090
No, it's nothing.

600
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,960
The editor must be waiting. Let's go.

601
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,620
I'm certain I left it here.

602
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,490
Where did it go?

603
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,380
I can look at it another time.

604
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,140
No, I always leave my diary here.

605
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,190
I don't know why it's not here.

606
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,880
I can't lose that.

607
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,190
Is this it by any chance?

608
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,690
It is!

609
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,870
Why is that there?

610
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,260
You must've forgotten about it.

611
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,950
I guess so.

612
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,480
Here.

613
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,160
You look just like him. Right?

614
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,510
This...

615
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,760
isn't me?

616
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,360
It's a photo from 27 years ago.

617
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,070
   

618
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,040
This was taken on the same day.

619
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,530
   

620
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,810
That girl...

621
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,640
is me.

622
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,780
Even if we met each other on the street now, I think we'd just pass by.

623
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:03,020
Twenty-seven years... is just that long.

624
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,800
I know.

625
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:08,900
What?

626
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,780
   

627
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,460
   

628
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,780
   

629
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,660
Are you okay?

630
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,790
 Kang San! 

631
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,460
   

632
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,500
What's wrong?

633
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,300
 Hold on. 

634
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:04,110
 When it becomes the year 2000, let's take a photo here to commemorate the millennium. 

635
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:08,040
 The apocalypse won't happen until then. Right? 

636
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,550
 Don't trust anyone. 

637
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,900
 You must not trust anyone. 

638
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,590
 I'm sorry. 

639
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,590
 Brother is sorry. 

640
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,020
What's wrong?

641
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,980
Your head hurts?

642
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:34,740
The medicine...

643
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,040
Hold on.

644
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,060
 We're going to get out of here. 

645
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,250
 Just wait a bit longer. 

646
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:33,080


647
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,370
Are you okay?

648
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,910
Take some medicine for now, and let's go to the hospital.

649
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,860
Choi Woo Jeong.

650
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,320
Where's Woo Jeong right now?

651
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,900
- What are you saying? 
 - Where's Woo Jeong?

652
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,640
How did you know my name?

653
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,090
Stop playing around.

654
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,650
Where can I meet Woo Jeong?

655
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:18,150
I told you... That's me in the photo from 27 years ago.

656
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,360
What about me, then?

657
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,560
What's my identity?

658
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,460
Why am I the only one here? Why am I here when I'm from 27 years ago?

659
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,060
The person in the photo isn't you.

660
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,940
This is me!

661
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,970
Not someone who looks like me. It is me!

662
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:37,140
It's not.

663
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:42,560
It's your misunderstanding. You probably— No, no. That's not it.

664
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,900
- It's probably an aftereffect of the accident— 
 - I'm not insane.

665
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,260
Everything's fake.

666
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,780
Nothing's real.

667
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,200
The real world has disappeared.

668
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:06,390
The world I know... and the people I know are all gone.

669
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,200
What's going on?

670
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,700
This place...

671
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,100
This place is...

672
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:23,200
This place I'm in right now...

673
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,440
is it even a real world?

674
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,750
I don't understand.

675
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,270
Nothing makes sense.

676
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,540
♫  A messy dawn  ♫

677
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,120
Young man.

678
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,880
♫  Insignificant, when it whirls, when it twirls  ♫

679
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,760
My name...

680
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,010
is Lee Kang San.

681
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:07,600
♫  Cause you said with emotionless eyes  ♫

682
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,600
♫  Sooty wound  ♫

683
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,880
♫  Oh, you're a liar from the beginning  ♫

684
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,310
♫  Cause you're saying  ♫

685
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,850
   

686
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,430
 If I tell you my name, can you find my family? 

687
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,730
 It's Lee Kang San. 

688
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:29,280
 On the last day you saw my father, you said a policeman came looking for him. Right? 

689
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,150
 - Is this just a cross to you? 
 - Do you expect me to confess my sins? 

690
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,670
 Someone also looked for the videotape back then. 

691
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,720
 The cult? 

692
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,930
 - Why are you acting like you're crazy? 
 - Did I... 

693
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,100
 really come from the past? 

694
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,250
 Adjust your memories. 

695
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,060
 Look into Yook Dong Joo and tie him to the case. 

696
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,020
 People are really weird. 

697
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,310
 They always do things they're told not to. 

698
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:54,240
 These people are really crossing the line. 

699
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,800
 - The same way I got here. 
 - Kang San!
