4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,460
Gosh... damn it...

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,130
   

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,710
I'm really going to lose it.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,770
Yes, hello.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,260
No, I'm outside. What's the matter?

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,870
 I met Kang San. 

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,820
Kang San found a corpse at Lake Sopyeong.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,680
- What did he find? 
 - Skeletal remains.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,610
I called because I was worried if Kang San got home safe.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,140
His phone is off.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,740
Hello?

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,890
 Are you certain... 

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,790
 I'm Lee Ha Neul? 

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,060
 Are you listening to me? 

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,410
D-Did you identify the corpse he found?

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,190
Kang San asked the same thing.

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,520
Why are you both so curious about that?

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,400
W-Well, of course, we'd be curious. Finding skeletal remains doesn't happen every day.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,680
When will you be home?

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,770
- Why do you ask? 
 - I need to tell you something.

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,000
- You can tell me over the phone. 
 - It's not something I can tell you over the phone.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, I'm a little busy today.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,330
It'll only take a moment. I'll call you again.

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,000
Hel—

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,010
Skeletal remains...

29
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,740
A USB?

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,990
Yes.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,170
I was wondering if Detective Han left it behind.

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,440
I confirmed he received it on the day he died.

33
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,920
- Is it important? 
 - It contains decisive evidence... for a case that Detective Han was investigating.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,760
I'll look for it.

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,950
   

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,860
She said she'd look for it and let us know.

37
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,280
Yes.

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,170
It'll calm down soon.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,630
 Everything I said about Kang San is true. 

40
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,640
 He's with me. 

41
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,460
 Kang San's also looking for you, Hyung. 

42
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,840
Kang San!

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Lee Kang San!

44
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,360
   

45
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Hey.

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,440
I went to the National Archives, but there was no record of your father's case.

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,900
What do you mean it wasn't there?

48
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,920
I mean, it should naturally be stored there.

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,100
But it's not there.

50
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,260
Those bastards hid it away.

51
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,260
The detective bastard who was at the bookstore. Those bastards must've hidden it.

52
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,430
What are you saying?

53
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,670
Wait, so there's no way to check this?

54
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,350
M-My mom?

55
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,550
Gosh, my stomach burns. I need to stop drinking or something.

56
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,280
A dog will quit pooping before you do.

57
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,650
- What? 
 - Oh, my.

58
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,610
Dong Joo's mom, did you see this?

59
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,480
Mind your manners, please. Dogs and pooping...

60
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,410
Take a look at this!

61
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,190
I'm letting you go only because I'm generous.

62
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,870
Gosh, I'm telling you to look at this!

63
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,480
What is it?

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,110
My daughter sent me an article, and that's what it's about.

65
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,510
What is this saying?

66
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,210
    
 It means Dong Joo is being sued for copying someone's work.

67
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,300
That's a load of bullshit!

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,120
Why are you yelling at me? The reporter wrote this!

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,310
Is everything reporters say the truth?

70
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,290
Would a reporter ever lie?

71
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,070
- They're all from prestigious colleges— 
 - Did you see it?

72
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,170
- See what? 
 - Did you see Dong Joo copying someone's work?

73
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,040
Well, I didn't see it.

74
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,730
Don't talk about it, then!

75
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,380
Don't think about spreading rumors when you don't even know anything.

76
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,210
How can you say that?

77
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,870
- I was just worried— 
 - Spare your worries for my son and

78
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,880
- worry about your daughter! 
 - What's wrong with my daughter?

79
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,140
You don't even know Dong Joo. He's nothing without his conscience!

80
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,400
I know this the best as his mom.

81
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,880
- I'm here. 
 - This must be jealous people scheming

82
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,130
against my son because he became too successful.

83
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,920
- Is something wrong? 
 - People just can't stand other people's succes!

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,930
We've got work to do. Where are you going?

85
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,020
- Mother! 
 - That woman's really...

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,700
   

87
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,820
It's an incorrect article, right?

88
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,540
Of course. Of course, it's incorrect.

89
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,110
Right?

90
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,770
Don't worry.

91
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,150
Why would Dong Joo ever plagiarize other people's work?

92
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,000
If he plagiarized, would the Korean Literature Prize award him?

93
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,450
Dong Joo's getting an award?

94
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,420
Dong Joo didn't tell you?

95
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,480
You know how he's never one to talk.

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,840
It's called Korean Literature Prize, the most honorable major award for writers.

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,760
My goodness! That's great news!

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,170
Wait...

99
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,600
- Take care, then. 
 - Where are you going?

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,860
I need to go serve dinner.

101
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,520
And tell Hyungnim about Dong Joo's award.

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,610
Wait, let me ask you one thing before you go.

103
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,470
You can even ask me ten things.

104
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,090
- One's enough. 
 - What is it?

105
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,580
When Dong Joo's father was hit by the car... do you remember who the police officer in charge was?

106
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,800
Your station's chief.

107
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,050
My chief?

108
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,070
I was in charge.

109
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,560
But why?

110
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,950
There was no record of it in the National Archives.

111
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,230
Why not?

112
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,880
That's why I'm asking.

113
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,560
I don't really know because I didn't close the case.

114
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,010
Who closed the case?

115
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,570
This is where I was assigned when I first became a police officer.

116
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,300
I went here and there and got to retire here.

117
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,810
- So, who closed the case? 
 - I was just about to tell you.

118
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,140
Back then, the local police here took care of hit-and-runs as well.

119
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,030
And that was my first case.

120
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,320
- And then? 
 - I was doing preliminary investigations and

121
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,510
the district detective took the case, saying he'll take care of it.

122
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,780
Who's that asshole detective?

123
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,080
   

124
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,740
   

125
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,900
What did the chief say?

126
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,820
He said not to bring in Byeon Jong Il as a material witness.

127
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,320
It's not even a summons. Why not even as a material witness?

128
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,270
It's obvious!

129
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,990
The assemblyman must've told the chief that

130
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,870
he's dead meat if he messes around believing an ex-convict murderer's story.

131
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,130
What can we do if we can't even bring in a material witness?

132
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,150
Do what? He's telling us not to do anything!

133
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,340
So we just sit around and do nothing?

134
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,570
We need to find the evidence.

135
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,260
If we just have the CCTV of what Noh Myeong Nam witnessed, we can even summon Byeon Jong Il.

136
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:50,390
By the way, if Detective Han secured the CCTV footage, he would've told me for sure.

137
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,170
Exactly! Can we even trust Noh Myeong Nam's testimony?

138
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,010
We can.

139
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,070
We confirmed Detective Han had taken the CCTV footage of that night.

140
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,790
- You confirmed it? 
 - Yes.

141
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,670
What about the footage? Did you secure it?

142
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,660
It'll be secured soon.

143
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,410
Come outside for a second.

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,710
I get scared when he wants to see me outside.

145
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,630
What is it?

146
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,420
Is there a secret?

147
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,040
Nothing like that.

148
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,210
When are they doing the autopsy?

149
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,300
Tomorrow morning.

150
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,860
Even after securing such important evidence, why didn't...

151
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,030
Detective Han say anything?

152
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,630
Well, he got into an accident the day he secured the footage, so he probably didn't get a chance.

153
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,920
He went straight home that day for his son's birthday.

154
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,430
There's a vacant time slot in the middle.

155
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,610
What do you mean?

156
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,640
Senior Han didn't go home straight after securing the footage.

157
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,150
There's a two-hour gap in between.

158
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,400
Two hours?

159
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,630
Detective Han's whereabouts at that time are uncertain.

160
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,870
You're saying one of the detectives is Byeon Jong Il's spy!

161
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,240
Lower your voice.

162
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,020
Are you sure?

163
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,650
Dead certain.

164
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,020
We need to share this with our team, too.

165
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,710
No way. You're not doubting them, are you?

166
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,780
That's not the case, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

167
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,130
I think we should keep this between us for now.

168
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,190
How do we get him?

169
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,500
I plan to show the public office worker the pictures.

170
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,700
We can't shove all those pictures of detectives to their faces.

171
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,740
To be safe...

172
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,750
we should start with our team.

173
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,590
What do you mean?

174
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,440
Ha Neul's corpse was found at Lake Sopyeong... as skeletal remains.

175
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,510
Who did you hear this from?

176
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,960
Inspector General came to Fortuna earlier in the day.

177
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,630
Jong Nam did?

178
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,200
Looks like he didn't tell you, huh?

179
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,120
How did they confirm the remains were that of Ha Neul?

180
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,100
Ha Neul's student ID must've been there.

181
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,560
A student ID?

182
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,020
Why are you so calm about this?

183
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,850
Should I be shocked about it, then?

184
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,470
We lived 27 years thinking he was dead.

185
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,010
Jong Nam came... to Fortuna to tell you about this?

186
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,990
He did have another business.

187
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,460
   

188
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,760
So, what do you think?

189
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,350
What?

190
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,620
If Ha Neul is dead,

191
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,310
who could have killed Kyeong Cheol?

192
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,500
Who do you think it was?

193
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Sang Woo has been missing for seven years.

194
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,420
We can't consider him to be alive.

195
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,850
Kyeong Cheol has been long dead.

196
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,670
So what?

197
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,120
Think about it. Kyeong Cheol got on Tae Man's bad side for talking about the scenario.

198
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,300
And Sang Woo always said he regretted what he did in the past whenever he got drunk.

199
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,030
What's your point?

200
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,070
Between the two of us, you know how Tae Man's a sociopath.

201
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,580
Even 27 years ago, we only followed what Tae Man was doing in his frenzy.

202
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,980
Honestly, the one who killed a person is Tae Man.

203
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,630
Not us.

204
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,600
It bothers me... how you keep saying "we."

205
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,040
Let's be clear about this.

206
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,230
I was only forced to watch you boys dancing with fire.

207
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,300
Are you saying you've got no blame in this now?

208
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,200
   

209
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,860
I'm about to tear up!

210
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,810
Won't Tae Man kill you for real, if he finds out about this?

211
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,160
You're not saying you'll tell him, are you?

212
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,580
Do you trust me?

213
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,840
Kang Hye Kyeong!

214
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,400
So what is it that you want from me?

215
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,180
You must've come because there's something you want.

216
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,060
You see and hear a lot of things in this place.

217
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,990
Tae Man meets...

218
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,370
most of his VIPs here, too.

219
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,990
Trying to find Tae Man's weakness or something?

220
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,680
I need something in my hand to go against Tae Man.

221
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,800
Doesn't the prosecution know best about Taekang Group's weakness?

222
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,420
If I move the prosecution, Tae Man will hear about it.

223
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,040
- And I'll be noticed. 
 - So...

224
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,450
you want me to stab Tae Man in the back?

225
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,340
Just give me the information... and I'll take care of the rest.

226
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,670
   

227
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,360
He was scared out of his wits... worried you'll kill him.

228
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,050
Goodness...

229
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,920
our country's in this state because our inspector general is such an idiot.

230
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
You made him the inspector general.

231
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,520
Why are you telling me this?

232
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,380
I'm warning you in advance because I see you dancing with fire again.

233
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,960
Stop fighting.

234
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,220
Not that you want to watch the fire dance?

235
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,270
Nope. I don't like it when things get rowdy.

236
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,550
So, take this.

237
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,040
What's this?

238
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,250
You know Director Shin's people sued Myeong Seok's company, right?

239
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,260
And?

240
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,010
Litigations are basically a mud fight.

241
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,920
They'll eventually bring up your fire dances.

242
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,380
Though the statute of limitations expired, and there's no evidence,

243
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,280
rumors will spread, and the public will start judging.

244
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,930
I'm sure you will get out of it fine, Chairman.

245
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,390
But I'll probably be the one to get stoned to death.

246
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,410
A conglomerate family's bastard child and a hostess.

247
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,090
I'm the perfect scapegoat.

248
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,870
Beautiful pictures, huh?

249
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,300
So tell them to withdraw their litigation with this?

250
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,450
You can take care of it quietly, Chairman.

251
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,100
- Why don't you do it yourself? 
 - On what grounds?

252
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,020
Your brother is the CEO of Literature and Imagination, Chairman.

253
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,680
Gosh, and Kyeong Cheol's wife doesn't like me.

254
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,820
Because Kyeong Cheol had so many affairs.

255
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,370
She dislikes you because you're prettier.

256
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,390
And that's why I like you.

257
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,420
I'm leaving.

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,060
Hold on.

259
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm dead sure I know this face...

260
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,080
but I just can't remember him.

261
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,450
He lives with Yook Dong Joo, but I just don't know who he is.

262
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,970
- Do you know him? 
 - Huh?

263
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,040
Looks like you do.

264
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,300
He does resemble someone, but I can't remember him.

265
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,110
- Yeah? 
 - Yes.

266
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,620
How is he related to Yook Dong Joo?

267
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,300
They met through a car accident, but I'm looking into it more.

268
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,440
Gosh, that brat, seriously.

269
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,540
Hey, Lee Kang San!

270
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,630
Let's go inside.

271
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,180
Did you eat?

272
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,150
Please don't leave your phone off. You need to be reachable at the very least.

273
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,580
Were you at Lake Sopyeong all this time?

274
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,630
Detective Park had called me.

275
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,770
I also heard you found the skeletal remains.

276
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,490
Get some rest. You must be tired.

277
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,420
Let's have dinner with hot kimchi stew.

278
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,640
You must've been shivering in the cold all day.

279
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,670
Kang San...

280
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,780
You can meet your brother.

281
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,310
♫  A messy dawn  ♫

282
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,500
♫  Under the black moon, insignificant  ♫

283
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,970
♫  When it twirls, when it twirls  ♫

284
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,990
♫  Chaos in the darkness  ♫

285
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,290
♫  You're a liar from the beginning  ♫

286
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,630
♫  Cause you said  ♫

287
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,930
♫  With emotionless eyes  ♫

288
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,110
♫  Sooty wound  ♫

289
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,280
♫  Oh, you're a liar from the beginning  ♫

290
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,300
♫  Cause you're saying  ♫

291
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:14,100
♫  An angry expression on your bitten lips  ♫

292
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:21,200
♫  Bent our history and mystery  ♫

293
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,080
According to Noh Myeong Nam's testimony,

294
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,250
Byeon Jong Il definitely killed or paid to kill Jeon Doo Hyeon.

295
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,420
That means Byeon Jong Il also killed Shin Kyeong Cheol.

296
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,850
That's right, since both crime scenes have the same signals.

297
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,530
Come on! Why would Byeon Jong Il leave such messages at the scene?

298
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,300
He'd just camouflage them as suicide.

299
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,060
That's what puzzles me, too.

300
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,200
We may lack evidence, but Byeon Jong Il definitely fabricated the Lake Sopyeong incident 27 years ago.

301
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,180
He has no reason to leave behind evidence that points to the Lake Sopyeong incident.

302
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,340
True.

303
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,960
It would make sense if different people did them.

304
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,120
But the messages left by the culprit are the same.

305
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,010
The messages are the same, but there's something different about the two scenes.

306
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,880
Something different?

307
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,880
We were missing something because we were too focused on the signals the culprit left at the scenes.

308
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,910
What is it?

309
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,990
 You're missing something important. 

310
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,600
 You must become humble, throwing away your arrogance in thinking you got the big picture. 

311
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,320
 That's how you can see the hidden picture. 

312
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,030
 It seems like you want to tell me something- 

313
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,400
It's the call I got. You all remember. Right?

314
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,740
 Regardless of how complicated or how puzzling a problem may be, 

315
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,450
 they all meet at one point down the road. 

316
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,690
 You know better than anyone. 

317
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,460
 Money. 

318
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,590
Jeon Doo Hyeon probably blackmailed Byeon Jong Il.

319
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,100
Saying he'll expose the incident from 27 years ago if he doesn't pay.

320
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,840
And that's the motive for murder.

321
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,930
Do you have proof?

322
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,840
Jeon Doo Hyeon did have suspicious money during the investigation two years ago.

323
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,110
- Suspicious money? 
 - Back then...

324
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,770
Jeon Doo Hyeon gambled away all the money he made from loan sharking and even had debt.

325
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,270
But he bought a five-story building under his wife's name.

326
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,070
And he was killed before paying off the balance.

327
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,440
- Yes. 
 - Didn't you check where he got the money?

328
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,400
His wife said she had saved the money but couldn't state its exact source.

329
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,960
So the guy who called you emphasized money... letting you know the motive for the murder?

330
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,620
Right.

331
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,800
But that doesn't change the crime scenes.

332
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,940
It's clear the signals left at the scenes are the same.

333
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,300
There's a difference.

334
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,230
For Shin Kyeong Cheol, the culprit taped his mouth after placing a glass jar with a USB in it.

335
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,960
For Jeon Doo Hyeon, the evidence was placed in his mouth after rigor mortis took place.

336
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,830
Shin Kyeong Cheol's death was carried out meticulously without a flaw.

337
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,750
Jeon Doo Hyeon's death is somewhat shabby.

338
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,310
It also feels rushed.

339
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,380
I didn't spot it even though I read the autopsy report so many times.

340
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,770
I also found out during another review.

341
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,350
Now that I think about it, the novel doesn't describe Jeon Doo Hyeon in much detail.

342
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,390
He doesn't get killed, either.

343
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,770
Yes.

344
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,310
Wait! How did the writer know about it and write the novel?

345
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,930
Is he a spiritual shaman or something?

346
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,490
You said he had an alibi when Shin Kyeong Cheol was murdered. Right?

347
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,880
Yes.

348
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,550
- He's not the culprit, either. 
 - Could be an accomplice.

349
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:57,190
I asked Writer Yook about Jeon Doo Hyeon in person, but he didn't seem to know who he was.

350
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,520
Gosh, what a headache.

351
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,440
Why don't we ask the writer to come and ask him? As a reference.

352
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,120
Let's all eat and come back to this later.

353
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,580
- Okay? My head's about to burst. 
 - Should I order some black bean noodles?

354
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,180
Gosh, I used my brain too much. It needs protein. Let's go for pork belly.

355
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,500
- We don't have time to eat right now. 
 - Detectives are humans, too.

356
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,840
We need to recharge. Let's go. Hyungnim, let's go.

357
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,300
Come.

358
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,470
All right, let's dig in.

359
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,760
You'll be shocked when you take a bite.

360
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,290
I'm pretty good at cooking.

361
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,710
You only put kimchi in kimchi stew?

362
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,170
You could've fried some eggs.

363
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,310
Hey, don't eat. Give it.

364
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,530
I'll eat just for you.

365
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,890
You've come back to life, huh?

366
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,940
Seeing how you're talking, you're alive again.

367
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,420
It's delicious.

368
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,290
Of course, it is.

369
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,910
Gosh, it's nice.

370
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,780
If the skeletal remains from Lake Sopyeong belong to Lee Ha Neul, who could be the man who called you?

371
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,950
Who knows?

372
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,170
Lee Ha Neul had a younger brother.

373
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,890
A younger brother?

374
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,560
You never told me this.

375
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,920
I was going to check, and I totally forgot.

376
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,260
His brother also disappeared after Lee Ha Neul went missing.

377
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,940
Are you saying the brother went missing?

378
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,380
It's not clear whether he went missing or ran away from home.

379
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,370
One second.

380
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,740
What are you looking for?

381
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,860
   

382
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,890
   

383
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:04,310
About one month after Lee Ha Neul went missing, his brother disappeared.

384
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,930
His name was Lee Kang San.

385
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,430
- Lee Kang San? 
 - Yes.

386
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,480
What a coincidence.

387
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,150
- What is? 
 - It's the same name as the student I met at Lake Sopyeong.

388
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,750
- The one who found the skeletal remains? 
 - Yes.

389
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,390
That student said he remembered his name to be Lee Kang San.

390
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,100
What an amazing connection he has with me.

391
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,220
How can something like this overlap, too?

392
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,080
Gosh, you scared me.

393
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,120
I remember it now.

394
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,920
- What? 
 - That cross...

395
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,530
I remember where I saw it.

396
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,030
What cross?

397
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,750
The skeletal remains I found...

398
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,420
The person was stabbed to death.

399
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,550
You saw how...

400
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,650
- the person was killed? 
 - It's not accurate because I only got a glimpse.

401
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,680
But a person holding a knife seemed to be trying to stab a man in the back.

402
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,030
You couldn't...

403
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,770
- s-see the face? 
 - I only saw the back.

404
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,490
Also, the knife holder's hand had a cross tattoo.

405
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,050
Could it be a gangster?

406
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,610
A cross tattoo?

407
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,160
 He's not dead. 

408
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,920
 God is alive. 

409
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,760
 Right? 

410
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,890
What's wrong?

411
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,760
You're saying a man with the cross tattoo killed a person. Right?

412
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,390
I think so.

413
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,870
What's the thing you said you remember just now?

414
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,480
The cross tattoo has the same shape as the cross we had at our orphanage.

415
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,050
Are you talking about the orphanage you stayed at?

416
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,680
Yes.

417
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,500
This means it has to do with the Lake Sopyeong incident.

418
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,950
Let's get him.

419
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,070
The videotape and the man with a cross tattoo...

420
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,970
They are the bones of the marlin we must find.

421
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,490
The bones of the marlin?

422
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:25,100
Evidence that can prove the truth from 27 years ago.

423
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,330
What are you looking for?

424
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,100
That young man's face looked familiar.

425
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,320
Here it is.

426
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,870
It's unbelievable how similar they look.

427
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,720
As if they were twins.

428
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,260
They don't look similar... They look the same.

429
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,040
I'd believe they're the same person.

430
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,600
They can't be the same person.

431
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,570
That's impossible.

432
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,820
I know...

433
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,610
There are people who look the same in the world.

434
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,540
They don't just have a vague resemblance.

435
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,260
The name he remembered was Lee Kang San.

436
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,550
Furthermore...

437
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,510
he's the one who discovered Lee Ha Neul's skeletal corpse.

438
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,880
Are you saying it wasn't a coincidence?

439
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,920
I can't say for sure, but I'm certain he has something to do with the Lee Ha Neul-Lee Kang San brothers.

440
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,840
   

441
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,620
   

442
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,030
This is it.

443
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,240
It's the same shape.

444
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,640
Was the tattoo you saw also—

445
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,190
   

446
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,620
Kang San, look at me.

447
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,050
Look at me.

448
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,330
Don't force yourself to remember.

449
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,730
You can forget the bad memories. It's okay not to remember them.

450
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,160
Let's get some rest.

451
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,740
We should cool down our brains once we use them.

452
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,780
Should we get some fresh air?

453
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,220
- Should we play a game? 
 - It is that cross.

454
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,070
That cross...

455
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,270
was always hanging inside that room.

456
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,070
"That room"?

457
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,710
That man...

458
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,830
is the devil.

459
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,930
Did you say his memories weren't completely restored?

460
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,810
Yes.

461
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,880
Could he have mistaken his father's name for his own?

462
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,270
Are you saying he's Lee Kang San's son?

463
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,240
That hypothesis is the most likely at this time.

464
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,820
Even so, things don't add up.

465
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,890
What do you mean?

466
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:11,270
I'm sure the car accident that day was something Yook Dong Joo didn't expect at all.

467
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,800
I was there.

468
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,040
And?

469
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,830
If that young man is Lee Kang San's son or someone related to him,

470
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,150
it's only right for Yook Dong Joo to have known him already.

471
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,200
- How so? 
 - The novel.

472
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,770
It would make sense only if Yook Dong Joo heard the truth about the Sopyeong Lake case from

473
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,920
Lee Ha Neul or Lee Kang San and wrote a novel based on it.

474
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,000
Lee Ha Neul and Lee Kang San might not be the only ones who know the truth behind the case.

475
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,780
How likely do you think it is for the writer who wrote a novel containing the truth behind

476
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,930
the Sopyeong Lake case to cross paths with the key person involved in the incident?

477
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,410
We can't prove coincidences.

478
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,910
Just as you can't prove the existence or absence of god.

479
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:01,060
However, there is something we can prove.

480
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,750
What would that be?

481
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,650
If that corpse really belongs to Lee Ha Neul, and that young man is Lee Ha Neul's son,

482
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,170
their DNA will match.

483
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,460
   

484
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,110
What are you doing? Everyone's waiting.

485
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,990
- I need to go somewhere. 
 - Where?

486
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,630
Mrs. Han!

487
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,580
What brings you here?

488
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,890
Is Lieutenant Lee inside?

489
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,060
Why are you looking for Senior?

490
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,590
Did you find it?

491
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,270
Yes, it was inside my son's desk.

492
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,110
Please come inside.

493
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,130
What did she find?

494
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,450
We found footage from the CCTV in front of Byeon Jong Il's house.

495
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:15,820
He said... that room was where the bad kids go.

496
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,800
Was it a punishment room?

497
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,690
They called it the Repentance Room.

498
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,190
Some of the children who were... called into that room never returned.

499
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,330
What do you mean they never returned?

500
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,720
It's exactly as I said.

501
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,700
The director said they'd been adopted by a nice family,

502
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,220
but many scary rumors circulated amongst the kids.

503
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,800
Some said they died...

504
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,940
and some said they were sold.

505
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,190
Brother and I were caught trying to run away from the orphanage...

506
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,970
and went to that room for the first time.

507
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,480
   

508
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,750
 Once trapped in that room, 

509
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,550
 he'd hit us until we repented. 

510
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,830
 He didn't even give us water. 

511
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,440
 I'm sorry. 

512
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,380
 Brother is sorry. 

513
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,450
He told us...

514
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,840
if we ran away again,

515
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,620
he'd trap other kids in that room.

516
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,210
Until we returned...

517
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,470
one by one...

518
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,730
Brother waited desperately...

519
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,720
to turn 19 years old.

520
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,600
That bastard is Satan.

521
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,350
If god exists, he'd be crying tears of blood.

522
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,920
Since the devil is using god's name to relish wealth and honor.

523
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,360
Is that man still living like that?

524
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,760
Even though 27 years have passed, has nothing changed?

525
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,120
I thought the world would be...

526
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,130
a better place by the time I became an adult.

527
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,570
But nothing has changed?

528
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,250
You're not an adult yet.

529
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,000
But 27 years have passed. And I came from the past.

530
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,410
There's no one who's not from the past.

531
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,200
Everyone comes from the past.

532
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,970
Don't try to lecture me.

533
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,310
How could I lecture you?

534
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,950
You're way more incredible than I am.

535
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,040
You're very incredible.

536
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:34,800
If it were me, I'd have set the orphanage on fire or killed the director.

537
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,350
You grew up to be a fine young man.

538
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:45,310
You really... are the miracle boy.

539
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,530
That devilish bastard...

540
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,270
I'm going to kill him with the abilities I have.

541
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,000
W-What?

542
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,150
Is that what you expected?

543
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,260
Yeah.

544
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,160
That's just how I'd feel.

545
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,520
I might end up doing that.

546
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,560
Since I don't even know myself.

547
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,060
Why are you being so capricious?

548
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,690
Don't you think that's why god gave me these superpowers?

549
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,120
To punish these devilish bastards.

550
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,100
Punish?

551
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,990
Are you saying you're going to kill them?

552
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,010
If needed.

553
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,550
If there's a god who bestows powers upon someone to kill people, that's the devil, not god.

554
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,430
To fight the devil, I don't care if I have to become one myself.

555
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,550
That's self-destruction. You'll only kill yourself trying to kill the devil.

556
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,120
Think about what you've achieved with your abilities.

557
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,670
You saved people. You helped people who were suffering.

558
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,890
You said you'd kill him if it were you.

559
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,100
I was just speaking out of anger and outrage.

560
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,720
Let's kill him with words for now, and act rationally.

561
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,230
- Rationally, how? 
 - We have to find evidence and reveal the truth.

562
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:10,010
As the manuscript thief, aren't you overusing the word "truth"?

563
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,120
Revealing the truth...

564
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,110
implies I'm going to confess I'm the manuscript thief.

565
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,460
But I can't reveal anything right now.

566
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:31,500
If I become a conman, everything I say loses credibility.

567
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,930
Who'd believe what a conman says?

568
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:38,920
So even if you find me sickening, bear with me until we find evidence.

569
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,730
Will you be okay?

570
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,820
You think I will?

571
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,720
My life will be over.

572
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,870
I'll feel ashamed, embarrassed, humiliated... and unable to walk with my head up.

573
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,700
Most importantly, when I think about how shocked my mom will be...

574
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,870
Gosh, but what can I do?

575
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,090
It's the price I have to pay for what I've done,

576
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,900
so I have to deal with it.

577
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,480
It wasn't a complete con.

578
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,740
You're the co-writer, to be exact.

579
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,240
Since you wrote the second part of the novel.

580
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,040
T-That's true.

581
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,590
What the heck?

582
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,220
- Why is that woman here? 
 - Who is that?

583
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,100
G-Go and hide.

584
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,870
- Why should I? 
 - Just hide for now!

585
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,210
Hurry, hurry! Hurry up!

586
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,040
Who is that woman?

587
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,660
The enemy. Someone who shouldn't find out about your identity.

588
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,530
   

589
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,840
   

590
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,670
 Ha Neul! What happened? 

591
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,090
 Do you know how worried I was when you suddenly disappeared from the villa? 

592
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,010
 Did something happen to the Dong Joo Bookstore uncle? 

593
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,270
 It's dangerous here. I might be under surveillance, too. 

594
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,060
 I asked if something had happened to Mister! 

595
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,000
 He passed away. 

596
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,420
 What? 

597
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,690
 He was in a hit-and-run accident last night. 

598
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,980
 It's dangerous to walk around like this. Tae Man's dad put gangsters on the loose. 

599
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,450
 He's looking for you because of the videotape. 

600
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,340
 It wasn't an accident. 

601
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,020
 Mister... died because of me. 

602
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,180
 What are you saying? 

603
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,270
 I called MIster to ask for help. 

604
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,680
 He said he'd look for the tape yesterday. 

605
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,470
 He said to call him today, 

606
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,550
 but I came because I couldn't reach him. 

607
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,400
 It's because of me. 

608
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,710
 I shouldn't have called him. 

609
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,490
 Then, where's the tape? 

610
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,020
 Tae Man's father probably took it. 

611
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,260
 No. 

612
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,670
 He's still looking for the tape. 

613
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:55,140
 - What? 
 - I was with Tae Man and the guys just now. 

614
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,660
 They said they're still looking for it. 

615
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,290
 Go back to the villa. My mom won't be back from the States for three months. 

616
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,150
 I can't hide forever. 

617
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,870
 What will you do? You don't even have the tape. 

618
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,030
 I have a copy. 

619
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,240
- Yeah.

620
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,860
 - I need to meet Kang San first. 
 - You can't go there. 

621
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,930
 You know the director is one of them. 

622
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,400
 Mister said Kang San visits the bookstore every day. 

623
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,160
 If Mister gave him the original, he's in danger, too. 

624
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,080
 I heard Kang San was absent today. 

625
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,720
 What? 

626
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,500
 Good job. 

627
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,120
 What should I do with that young man? 

628
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,760
 Bury him without making a mess. 

629
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,690
 Yes, sir. 

630
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:35,340
 The director has himself a great worker of god. 

631
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,360
 Yes, it's me, Chairman Lee. 

632
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,710
 Everything's been taken care of. 

633
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,160
 There's no need for you to worry. 

634
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,050
 Okay. 

635
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,640
 Where's my brother? 

636
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,080
 Where's my brother? 

637
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,030
 Should I get rid of him? 

638
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,210
 What have you done with my brother? 

639
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,980
   

640
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,160
   

641
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,570
 You're a dead person now. 

642
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,060
 Your name, me, Sopyeong Lake... 

643
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,240
 Forget everything and live like a ghost. 

644
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,560
 Don't show up ever again. 

645
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,560
 Go. 

646
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,070
 What have you done to my brother? 

647
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,050
 I found salvation. 

648
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:53,150
 I witnessed god's miracle right in front of my eyes. 

649
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,560
 Your brother was chosen by god. 

650
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,070
 - What do you mean? 
 - God has called him. 

651
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,510
 You killed Kang San? 

652
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,350
 God has taken him. 

653
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,650
 Your brother... 

654
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,280
 No— 

655
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,870
 God has saved you. 

656
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,300
♫  Imma tell you I can't stop now  ♫

657
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,520
♫  Nothing holds me back now  ♫

658
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,730
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

659
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,980
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

660
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,260
♫  Show you I can't fall now  ♫

661
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,480
♫  Cannot tell me to slow down  ♫

662
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,640
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

663
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,020
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

664
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,800
♫  Come alive  ♫

665
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,790
Mister...

666
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,770
♫  Baby, don't close your eyes  ♫

667
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,660
♫  At night, I come alive  ♫

668
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,060
Where's Detective Kim?

669
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,410
He was just here.

670
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,450
It's Jeon Doo Hyeon.

671
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,620
Why is the passenger not getting off?

672
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,160
I know, huh?

673
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,370
The CCTV didn't get the passenger side?

674
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,250
It didn't catch the face.

675
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,140
Fast forward.

676
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,490
- It's Noh Myeong Nam's car. 
 - Everything aligns with his statement.

677
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:52,970
- This is enough to summon Byeon Jong Il. 
 - All right.

678
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,930
Let's summon an incumbent politician and smile for the camera and get some media attention.

679
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,960
It's not going to be easy.

680
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,460
This video alone can't prove Byeon Jong Il killed Jeon Doo Hyeon.

681
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,720
We'll have to catch the guy in the video and get him to testify.

682
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,720
Put out a warrant for this Grandeur vehicle and check the owners.

683
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,330
- Yes, sir. 
 - He probably junked it, immediately.

684
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,180
I'll search junked car records, too.

685
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,090
Sounds good.

686
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,340
Where the hell is Detective Kim?

687
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,430
I'm sorry!

688
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,630
Were you hiding somewhere studying for the promotion exam?

689
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,880
I was in the restroom. It must be something I ate because my stomach hurts.

690
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,320
You didn't even have dinner, so what do you mean?

691
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,480
It must've been something I ate for lunch.

692
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,260
Did you check the video?

693
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,550
- Take a look. 
 - Okay.

694
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,900
Gosh, I'm hungry.

695
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,560
I want black bean noodles with extra noodles.

696
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,670
What? Not pork belly?

697
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,010
Pork belly is out of the question.

698
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,740
Everyone agrees with black bean noodles.

699
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,480
- I want spicy seafood noodle soup. 
 - I'll eat separately.

700
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,490
- Why? 
 - I have something to do.

701
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,180
- I'll be back. 
 - Okay.

702
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,050
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

703
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,170
You must like coffees with strong acidity.

704
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,670
I just drink whatever I have.

705
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:55,040
Anyhow... why did you come here?

706
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:01,330
We didn't get to talk much last time and I just happened to be in the area.

707
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:06,000
I don't think we're close enough to justify that.

708
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,890
Right, here.

709
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,810
What is this?

710
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,880
It's the drink you had with Chairman Lee Tae Man.

711
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,400
A drink worth 900,000 won per shot isn't my taste.

712
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,080
It's my first time in a writing room.

713
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,660
It's quite spacious.

714
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,720
Do you live here alone?

715
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:43,450
Writers usually have people who help with data research.

716
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,280
I think you're here for a reason, so say what you need to say.

717
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,350
I came because I wanted to meet the young man who lives with you.

718
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,360
Is he here right now?

719
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,980
Digging into personal affairs is a crime. You're aware, right?

720
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,840
 Chairman Lee Tae Man showed me a photo of you and the young man. 

721
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,360
You didn't know your car had a tracking device on it, did you?

722
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,530
- A tracking device? 
 - It's not there anymore.

723
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,050
I took care of it.

724
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,560
I came for some answers.

725
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:34,800
 The young man in the photo bears an incredible resemblance to someone I know. 

726
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,490
There are many people who resemble each other in this world.

727
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,600
There's Neo Hoon Ah for one. 
  (A famous Korean singer's look-alike) 

728
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,430
Well, of course.

729
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,710
But...

730
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,800
I still wanted to meet him.

731
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,040
I wondered if he was the reincarnation of the dead boy.

732
00:57:55,330 --> 00:58:00,200
You're saying a bunch of nonsense, and I don't know what to say.

733
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:07,160
I don't know what your plan is, but Chairman Lee Tae Man shouldn't be taken lightly.

734
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,580
I still don't understand what you're saying.

735
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,570
I think I gave you enough of a warning, so I'll leave now.

736
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,870
Excuse my abrupt visit.

737
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,800
Which side are you on?

738
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,110
I wish you good luck.

739
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,420
Who is that person? She knows me.

740
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,230
Then she could be someone I know.

741
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,690
Wait!

742
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:26,290
There was a female student who was with Lee Ha Neul at Sopyeong Lake.

743
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,440
He wrote the initials of everyone else, so their names could be guessed.

744
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,000
And he specifically described the crimes they committed.

745
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,390
But he only described that female student as "that child" just once.

746
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:42,910
It's my guess the author wanted to protect that girl.

747
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:47,670
Are you that female student who was with Lee Ha Neul...

748
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:52,490
that night at Sopyeong Lake 27 years ago?

749
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:02,380
As Chairman Lee Tae Man said, you're quite naive.

750
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:08,130
That's just a novel. A novel you wrote yourself.

751
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:23,760
What's her name?

752
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,370
Her name wasn't on her business card.

753
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,450
A 900,000 won drink, my foot.

754
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,190
One shot costs 900,000 won?

755
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,290
Apparently.

756
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:45,160
I'll ask her name when I return—

757
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,980
What is this?

758
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,510
Why?

759
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,340
Why is it so light?

760
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,770
Is she joking?

761
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,740
What is she trying to do here?

762
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,310
Huh?

763
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,630
What's that?

764
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:44,090
♫  Shout out loud  ♫

765
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:48,050
♫  On your two faces covered by darkness  ♫

766
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:52,400
♫  Venom  ♫

767
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,600
♫  Those hypocrisies  ♫

768
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,510
   

769
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:00,090
 Timing is what's important. 

770
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,090
 Is that person the culprit? 

771
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,660
 He probably wanted to warn us. 

772
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,430
 It's a sort of a starting flare of his revenge? 

773
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,430
 It's you, isn't it? 

774
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,710
 Did you touch the corpse? 

775
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,610
 She must have another intention. 

776
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:10,670
 What's our plan from now on? 

777
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,230
 Finding evidence to reveal the truth from 27 years ago. 

778
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,750
 This student's name is Lee Kang San. 

779
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,370
 I came from 27 years in the past. 

780
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,000
 - What? 
 - It's true. 

781
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,760
 You said you have supernatural powers. Now you're saying you're from the past? 

782
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,250
 - Are you sure? 
 - What is this? 

783
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,880
 You don't see anything? 

784
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,900
 Does the videotape even exist? 

785
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,560
 Something dangerous could happen. 

786
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,070
 I'm always worried Kang San won't be able to control his powers. 

787
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,630
♫  Your dark face that hides the world  ♫
