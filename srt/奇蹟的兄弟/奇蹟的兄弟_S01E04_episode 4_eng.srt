1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,730
    
 How did you write this novel?

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,730
Hey, what kind of a question is that?

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,480
Did you really write this novel, Mr. Yook?

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,160
My goodness.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
What are you trying to say?

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,630
Are all of the stories in this novel your original creations?

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,150
What else could it be?

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,130
Did you have actual cases you used as a motive?

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,870
There was none! A novel is a work of fiction.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,430
It's a creation of the writer.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,900
When materials from numerous sources

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,330
touch your brain, these things called inspirations sprout.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,390
Then, imagination becomes the nutrition, raising the stem...

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,930
and a story forms as the branches—

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,210
The murder in your book is happening in real life.

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,320
W-What did you say?

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:59,480
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 Waiting on a Miracle Team 🙏 @ Viki.com 

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,690
Excuse me.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,490
It's similar, down to the details of the crime scene and the murder method, that only police know.

20
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,040
As if you've seen the murder scene in person.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,710
Is it a crime to have an imagination?

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,350
Maybe it's not from your imagination.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:39,530
Are you saying I'm carrying out the murders in my novel... in real life and making them come true right now?

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,730
Is that so?

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,040
Don't be ridiculous. What idiot writer would imitate his own novel and commit murders?

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,600
- Don't misunderstand. 
 - You're making me misunderstand!

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,770
A detective's job is to investigate when suspicions arise, and I'm just doing my job.

28
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,760
There's an SF novel called "Ready Player One," written by an American writer, Ernest Cline.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,030
An imaginary world in a novel from 10 years ago...

30
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,670
is being reenacted entirely in the virtual world.

31
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,320
And Isaac Asimov used self-driving cars in his novel a long time ago.

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,090
I'm saying cases similar to those in a novel are more than possible.

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,150
Someone sent your book to me.

34
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,780
It wasn't from anyone I know, and you said you didn't send it to me, either.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,750
So what?

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,270
I'm saying someone sent it to me intentionally.

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,570
Some crazy psychopath must be imitating the novel and committing murders.

38
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,660
That's impossible.

39
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,470
The murders started before the novel was published.

40
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,930
If the crimes in the novel are being carried out...

41
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,530
it means someone who read the novel before it was published is the only one capable.

42
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,870
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,850
So, you mean that I'm the suspect.

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm only trying to solve this mystery.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,190
Be more scientific! Why is a detective writing a novel?

46
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,980
Where were you after 11:00 p.m. on September 19th?

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,200
By chance...

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,080
do you know me?

49
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,690
You look so much like someone I know.

50
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,190
I was mistaken.

51
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,380
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,940
   

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,280
Hold on a minute.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,650
Hold on a minute!

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,660
Are you sure you don't know me?

56
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,960
The person who looks like me...

57
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,990
Isn't it me?

58
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,930
You're not.

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,890
He couldn't be so young.

60
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,110
Why not?

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,370
He's the same age as me.

62
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,140
I see.

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,900
Please excuse me.

64
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,660
Wait—

65
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,540
What's your father's name, by the way?

66
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,900
You resemble him so much.

67
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,700
I just wonder if your father is the one...

68
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,270
I can't remember.

69
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,110
I remember that day clearly.

70
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,120
Because it was an unforgettable day.

71
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,170
I was with you, Detective Park!

72
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,540
Thunder, lightning, car accident, and emergency room!

73
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,640
Don't you remember?

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,600
You checked my alibi, so please leave if you're done asking.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,070
I'm very busy.

76
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,130
I'm sorry, but can I have a glass of water, please?

77
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,920
Freshwater, if you can.

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,380
Gosh.

79
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,510
How long does it take for a novel to be published?

80
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,120
Why do you care?

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm just curious!

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,970
Was there someone who... got to read the novel before it was published?

83
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,510
I always work alone—

84
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,450
 You did something very dangerous. 

85
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,450
 This novel was never meant to come out to this world. 

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,120
Was there?

87
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,850
N-No, none at all.

88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,010
Really?

89
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,250
H-Here you go.

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,690
Thank you.

91
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,640
I'll take my leave since you're busy.

92
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,230
Okay.

93
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,350
Twenty-seven years ago, in a lake near the capital...

94
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,750
a homeless person was found dead.

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,570
It's the same year as the background of your novel.

96
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,090
1995.

97
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,210
The victim and the murderer were both homeless people.

98
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,660
Of course, there are many differences as well.

99
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,890
Since the culprit was found to have been framed in the novel.

100
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,310
It sounds as if I've written a boring novel, plastered with obvious clichés here and there.

101
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,120
Thank you for your cooperation.

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,530
Please look someone up for me.

103
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,430
The name is Yook Dong Joo.

104
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,700
Yes, the writer. Thank you.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,500
   

106
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,190
   

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,070
   

108
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,930
Lake Sopyeong...

109
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,900
   

110
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,130
   

111
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,440
   

112
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,850
   

113
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,580
I lost my memory due to a car accident.

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,290
I'll be going now.

115
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,490
I need to get an MRI before I can get discharged.

116
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,140
W-Wait a minute. Wait.

117
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,920
Will you give me a call?

118
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,910
I don't have any other meaning.

119
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,640
I just want to have a word with you.

120
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,860
You can call me whenever you're free.

121
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,720
Okay.

122
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,110
 She's the same as Dong Joo. 

123
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,180
 I can't see anything... 

124
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,140
 and I don't hear anything. 

125
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,940
What's wrong?

126
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,070
Young man?

127
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,600
What's the matter?

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,740
It's nothing.

129
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,630
Okay, then.

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,760
 Kang San! 

131
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,290
   

132
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,630
   

133
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,110
   

134
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,430
   

135
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,390
   
   

136
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:39,150
 "Hell is empty... and all the demons are here." 

137
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,040
 "As T's kicking gets faster, his limbs withdraw into a ball." 

138
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,600
 - Hey! 
 - Nice! 

139
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,420
 Now, come on! 

140
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,760
 All right! 

141
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,740
 Move, move, move! 

142
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,640
 Kill him! 

143
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,040
 - Please let me go. 
 - You splashed on me. 

144
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
 "Red eyes full of madness. 

145
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,270
 J and S yell louder and louder as they do the assault." 

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,730
 "And K's camera is recording happily." 

147
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,560
 Hey, awesome. 

148
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,890
 "Those legs that were withdrawn spread apart hopelessly... exposing a white belly. 

149
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,550
 Giggling and laughing, J and S drag him 

150
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,010
 all muddy and bloody following T's order. 

151
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,910
 To the lake, to the lake. 

152
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,300
 A red trail of blood follows on the black road, drawing a long streak. 

153
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,710
 Like a mourning song of coffin carriers." 

154
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,970
 "Please stop! My shout, which failed to become a sound, 

155
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,310
 also fails to shake even a speck of dust, and plummets into the dark ground." 

156
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,330
 "It's turning! It's turning again! 

157
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,860
 The wheels on the demon's chariot rush. 

158
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,960
 Just like a stone on the road getting kicked here and there by those wheels, 

159
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,880
 he only hopes for this nightmare to pass, 

160
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,990
 with his limbs curled up into a ball." 

161
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,030
 "That child cries. 

162
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,520
 That child is crying. 

163
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,360
 How long will it be until morning? 

164
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,760
 Will all of this disappear 

165
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,830
 when morning comes, like how the darkness gets chased by the sun? 

166
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,410
 Is this a dream I can wake up from? 

167
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,230
 The morning might never come... 

168
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,880
 as long as... the demons' wheels keep turning." 

169
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
 "They're just like a pack of hyenas crowding around 

170
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,670
 an old sheep that's hardly breathing because he's on the verge of death." 

171
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,920
 "It's not to satiate hunger." 

172
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,780
 "It's just a night's entertainment for wrapping up... 

173
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,520
 their boring teenage years." 

174
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,050
   

175
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,050
 - Hey, hurry up. 
 - He's so heavy. 

176
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,800
 Geez. 

177
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,700
 Gosh, why is he so heavy? 

178
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,050
 "At that moment! He opened his eyes. 

179
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,520
 His bloody dying eyes are fixed on me." 

180
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,850
 Gosh. 

181
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,520
 Help us out! 

182
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,910
 Hey, we're almost there. 

183
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,420
 Gosh, this is so annoying. 

184
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,230
 Hey, just hurry up and throw him! 

185
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,170
 "Like a miracle. Yes. 

186
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,460
 I didn't know that was the last chance for him and me to survive 

187
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,760
 just like a miracle." 

188
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,210
 "He... He opened his eyes!" 

189
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,560
 "'He's alive!' As soon as I yelled... 

190
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,610
 "'Throw! Throw him!'  I heard T's voice." 
 - One... 

191
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,930
 two, three! 

192
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,480
 "Splash." 

193
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,150
 "At that moment, who was the one who drowned?" 

194
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,570
 "It was me. 

195
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,450
 Hell is still empty as ever... 

196
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,130
 and all the demons are here. 

197
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,240
 If the crimes in the novel are being carried out... 

198
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,590
 it means someone who read the novel before it was published is the only one capable. 

199
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,340
No, no. That's nonsense.

200
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,530
It's just a coincidence. Nothing more.

201
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,880
   

202
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,720
   

203
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,660
   

204
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,170
   
   

205
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,240
   

206
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,140
   

207
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,900
Crazy fucker. What have you done?

208
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,120
Oh, my god!

209
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,380
You'll never do it again, right?

210
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,350
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

211
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,200
Shush. Be quiet.

212
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,660
Hey, did you know about the incident from 27 years ago?

213
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,220
Nope. The movie director's corpse was found in the lake recently.

214
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,440
- There was quite a commotion because he was famous. 
 - And then?

215
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,740
My father said the lake is haunted, saying there was a murder there a long time ago, too.

216
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,560
What he told me sounded similar to your novel, so I just thought you referenced it. You didn't?

217
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,740
Y-You can get me the details of that incident. Right?

218
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,140
Why do you ask?

219
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,130
I'm curious since you said it's similar to my novel.

220
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,300
So what if it's similar? It's not like you plagiarized.

221
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,290
Can't you find the investigation report on the police's electronic database?

222
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,510
It's not on there if it's from 27 years ago.

223
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,430
The National Archive would have it as a paper document.

224
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,390
Anyway, the data is there. Right?

225
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,540
Why bother looking for it?

226
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,120
Also, look into Director Shin Kyeong Cheol's case in detail and send me what you find.

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,200
Anyone other than the person in charge can't find out about an ongoing case.

228
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,220
Why are you being so timid?

229
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,770
How long are you going to stay a senior patrol officer?

230
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,670
When violent crimes come up, you need to look into them and analyze them voluntarily.

231
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,190
That's how you'll become more skilled and get promotions!

232
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,400
You said your goal is to become a profiler, didn't you?

233
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,950
You're acting really weird today.

234
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,070
I've always been really weird!

235
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,660
You think I don't know you?

236
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,360
You won't even come this far unless you have to. Why does that case matter so much?

237
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,430
How many times do I have to tell you? I'm curious.

238
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,940
All right.

239
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,810
Geez. T-T-Thanks. I'm off.

240
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,120
Hey... I'll explain...

241
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,340
I'll explain everything in detail later.

242
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,390
I'm sorry for getting mad.

243
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,930
I don't know what it is, but you can always hit me up.

244
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,580
I'm always on your side. You know that, right?

245
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,900
Of course. Take care.

246
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,650
Stop by and see your mom since you're here!

247
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,600
I'll call!

248
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,720
The principal contacted me in person.

249
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,650
It's because you're not picking up.

250
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,460
He wanted you to do a lecture for your juniors.

251
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,260
What do you mean, why? You're a hero and a famous writer.

252
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,690
You didn't promise him I'll do it, did you?

253
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,600
 It's a good thing, though! 

254
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,020
So you did promise him?

255
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,900
 No, you have to do that yourself. 

256
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,850
 Where are you? 

257
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm driving.

258
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,230
Also, stop working at the restaurant now. I'll take care of your living expenses.

259
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,820
Don't even worry about that!

260
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,210
I'm not working here for the money. It's just to get my body moving.

261
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,060
Yes, yes. It's dangerous to talk on the phone while driving. Hang up now.

262
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,320
Did your son tell you to stop working?

263
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,210
Well, he's been telling me to.

264
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,940
Gosh, I'm jealous.

265
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,330
 How did you write this novel? 

266
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,990
 Did you really write this novel, Mr. Yook? 

267
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,310
 The murder in your book is happening in real life. 

268
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,480
 You did something very dangerous. 

269
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,740
 This novel was never meant to come out to this world. 

270
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,120
If this bastard kills another person... should I report him?

271
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,110
No, no. That would be the end for me.

272
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,450
This is driving me up the wall.

273
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,950
   

274
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,680
Hey.

275
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,710
Come to the office. We need to discuss something.

276
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,200
Today's not good for me.

277
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,410
 Come or things will get really bad. 

278
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,710
   

279
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,830
   

280
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,160
I know you've become the hero of the people.

281
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,600
But it's an important matter, so come by three.

282
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,490
What's this important matter?

283
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,150
We've got a headache.

284
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,620
So what is it?

285
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,590
It's not something to be talked about over the phone, so don't be late.

286
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,610
What is it?

287
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,380
Just come, and we'll talk about it. Also...

288
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,970
it looks like it's about time we do the 10th print.

289
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,070
So I calculated the interim settlement.

290
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,700
The payment includes the signing fee for the next book, so check.

291
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,820
Strike while the iron is hot.

292
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:37,810
   
   

293
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,170
   

294
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,790
Nothing happened. It's okay.

295
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,600
Yook Dong Joo, just sprint straightforwardly like this.

296
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,750
Just go all out ahead! Run!

297
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,490
Let's go!

298
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,030
What's this?

299
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,800
My goodness.

300
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,170
    
 How many zeroes are there?

301
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,330
One, ten, hundred, thousand... Ten million, whoa—

302
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,100
Fifty million won?

303
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,780
- Whoa... 
 - Gosh-

304
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,360
W-What's going on here?

305
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,130
He must've lost it!

306
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,300
Whoa...

307
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,540
Great! Run!

308
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,320
Yes!

309
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,220
Hey, sorry for coming late—

310
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,990
Hello.

311
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,990
Oh, wh-what brings you here, Detective Kim?

312
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,880
I came to check up on the domestic abuse victim and stopped by because they said you might be here.

313
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,770
I also have something to tell you.

314
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,800
Wait... What's wrong?

315
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,130
The abused child's mother keeps making weird claims.

316
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,420
Weird claims?

317
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,670
She said the demon tried to strangle her or something.

318
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,930
Sorry?

319
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,810
But it turned out to be self-inflicted.

320
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,290
S-Self-inflicted?

321
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,740
Yes.

322
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,440
According to that woman, the demon ordered her, and she strangled herself without knowing.

323
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,280
And she has quite a deep trace on her neck.

324
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,000
It looks like a show to get a lighter sentence.

325
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,900
- But I thought you should be aware. 
 - I see.

326
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,700
- See you later. 
 - O-Okay.

327
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,960
When did you get here?

328
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,610
Just now.

329
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,840
What are you doing here?

330
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,680
The breeze feels nice.

331
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,760
And the sun feels great, too.

332
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,100
Just sitting here makes you feel pleasant, and it makes you happy.

333
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,020
I'm glad you're optimistic.

334
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,440
Did you finish the discharge process?

335
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,570
Yes.

336
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,100
Let's go.

337
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,940
Hold on.

338
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,860
You...

339
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,160
Did you really mean to kill her?

340
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,820
Kill who?

341
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,200
The child's mother.

342
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,520
You weren't really trying to kill her. Right? You only meant to scare her. Right?

343
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,990
I told you.

344
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,080
I tried to kill her.

345
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,180
Wait! You weren't joking?

346
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,900
You really tried to kill her?

347
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,360
I was thinking a person like her deserves to die and it all happened naturally.

348
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,540
Let's go.

349
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,640
Why are you bringing that for?

350
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,490
You can't even wear them.

351
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,910
Because I can.

352
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,660
I'll buy you everything you need, so get rid of them.

353
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,190
That's up to me.

354
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,400
You're more of a dumbass than I thought.

355
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,110
And this one is on a serious note.

356
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,920
Don't cause trouble while you're living with me.

357
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,560
I can't promise you.

358
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,720
Please, let's live without trouble.

359
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,250
Just ignore them. Just ignore them, even if you see or hear something.

360
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,920
Are you able to do that?

361
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,830
That's the easiest thing to do in the world!

362
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,650
It's the hardest thing to do for some people.

363
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,870
You're being a dumbass blatantly.

364
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,320
Someone's life is someone else's life.

365
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,210
Even if you have a special power, changing someone else's life is an abuse of power.

366
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,100
A man can become a demon while trying to become a god.

367
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,080
There are two people.

368
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,920
The evil person must die for the good person to live.

369
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,190
What would you do?

370
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,330
Are you saying evil people deserve to die?

371
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm the one who asked.

372
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,040
You have to save both.

373
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,430
That wasn't the question!

374
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,990
The question itself is wrong.

375
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,770
What a bunch of nonsense.

376
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,680
Right or left. Good or evil.

377
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,670
Young and old. Women and men.

378
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,960
Narrow-mindedness that divides people into black and white

379
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,290
is what encourages hate and makes people petty.

380
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,790
You think humans are that simple?

381
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,910
Everyone has good and evil coexisting in them. You and I are no exclusions.

382
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,600
Please be quiet.

383
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,630
Hey, your hyung is talking right now—

384
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,500
You're too loud, and I can't hear the music.

385
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,030
The music? Wh-What music are you talking about?

386
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,270
How do you turn the volume up?

387
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,330
♫  I won't fall  ♫

388
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,730
♫  No problem  ♫

389
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,600
♫  I am in this world  ♫

390
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,070
♫  - And people who love me  ♫ 
 - Hey, how do you know this song?

391
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,120
♫  With my people...  ♫

392
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,980
♫  - I want to go my way  ♫ 
 - Go my way!

393
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,780
♫  It was very hard and lonely  ♫

394
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,530
♫  That's just practice  ♫

395
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,900
♫  I won't fall  ♫

396
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,660
♫  No problem  ♫

397
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:41,230
- No problem! 
 - No problem

398
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,030
   

399
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,390
   

400
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,540
   

401
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,570
   

402
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,550
   

403
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,360
   
   

404
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,510
   

405
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,720
   

406
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,290
   

407
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,930
Lee Byeong Man!

408
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,200
Wow, how long has it been?

409
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,230
Have you been well?

410
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,320
It's nice to see you.

411
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,800
   

412
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,580
   

413
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,500
You remember the guy named Jeon Doo Hyeon. Right?

414
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,570
Jeon Doo Hyeon?

415
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,290
The witness of the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago.

416
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,100
Yes, yes. I do.

417
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,440
I heard he was murdered, huh?

418
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,480
A female detective had come by about two years ago.

419
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,660
You were the last person Jeon Doo Hyeon spoke to on the phone before getting murdered.

420
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,940
Of course, she had come to you.

421
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,720
I also know since I used to be a detective.

422
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,140
Have you been keeping in touch with Jeon Doo Hyeon?

423
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,590
Keeping in touch, my foot.

424
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,570
That's what this position is like.

425
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,920
All those nobodies who only got a glimpse of me contact me.

426
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,610
Jeon Doo Hyeon was also one of those nobodies.

427
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,280
I see.

428
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,640
You didn't get the culprit yet?

429
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,290
No.

430
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,610
We're investigating from square one again.

431
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,310
Why?

432
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,280
I think it's related to another case.

433
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,420
What's the other case?

434
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,610
We're not too sure of it yet.

435
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,330
You know, 27 years ago...

436
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,590
you had brought in Jeon Doo Hyeon, saying he was a witness.

437
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,830
I did. And?

438
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:12,880
I was just curious how you found a witness that none of us were able to find anywhere.

439
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,210
Why are you curious about that?

440
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,520
Well... since it's such a lost case...

441
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,580
I'm trying to learn a trick or two from you.

442
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,310
You were a rookie back then, and I was a veteran.

443
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,370
The years of experience are my only trick.

444
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,160
I see.

445
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,760
By the way... why are you bringing up the case from 27 years ago

446
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,140
when you're investigating the Jeon Doo Hyeon case?

447
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,790
There's something that bothers me.

448
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,490
What is it?

449
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,230
Well, it's nothing.

450
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,290
I'll get going now.

451
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,980
Your retirement isn't too far away, is it?

452
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,350
I'll look for a fitting place for you so come to me after you retire.

453
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,760
I plan to become...

454
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,840
a farmer after I retire.

455
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,620
 Nothing special. 

456
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,150
 I researched relevant books, the internet, and libraries. 

457
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,020
 I interviewed people, too. 

458
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,920
 You must have so much material. 

459
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,660
 Would you be willing to share your research notes? 

460
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,680
 That will be difficult. 

461
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,570
 I'm not very organized. 

462
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,160
 Plus, it's considered a trade secret as well. 

463
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,490
 That's too bad. 

464
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,310
 Is the piece based on a real-life incident? 

465
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,790
 I'm not sure if there was a similar incident, 

466
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,710
 but the narrative of the piece is fiction stemming from my imagination. 

467
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,900
   

468
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,280
   

469
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,550
If you press 1, it'll dial me. So just press 1.

470
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,760
It has a camera and a Mymy in it, right? 
  (A portable music player from 1981) 

471
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,110
Mymy, my foot.

472
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,400
Go home and study the manual.

473
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,670
It's my coming home gift for you, so don't lose it.

474
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:45,030
You might have lost your memories, but you must have played a lot of games in the past.

475
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,800
Now, you seem like a teenager.

476
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,560
Wait...

477
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,030
My card.

478
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,620
Hey, don't go anywhere and stay here. Okay?

479
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,530
Oh, yes. Thank you.

480
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,240
Take care. Thanks.

481
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,770
Where did he go?

482
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:38,010
I don't even have time. Wait...

483
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,300
Gosh...

484
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,920
   
 (Means "No Name" in Korean) 

485
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,920
   

486
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,150
Gosh, my goodness!

487
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,320
Where did he go? Geez.

488
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,700
   

489
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,670
Yes, yes.

490
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:19,710
No, I'm near the office, but I had to take care of something.

491
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,130
Yes, I said I'll be there.

492
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,850
I'll be there. I'll be there right now!

493
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,420
I'm going. Okay.

494
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,900
Gosh.

495
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,750
Where the heck did he go?

496
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,450
Hold on a second.

497
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,230
Where are you?

498
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,890
Can you hear my voice?

499
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,880
Hey, it's me, Hyung.

500
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,890
Can't you hear— Gosh, I'm losing it here.

501
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,600
What time is it?

502
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,810
   

503
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,240
   

504
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,110
   

505
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,010
   

506
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,460
Please help me!

507
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,880
That guy keeps following me.

508
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,540
He's been following me for quite some time now.

509
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,440
Is it him?

510
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,150
   

511
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,110
What is this?

512
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,640
Director Shin Kyeong Cheol's scenario.

513
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,390
Director Shin Kyeong Cheol?

514
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,110
Why did you hide it?

515
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,610
H-Hide? Hide what?

516
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,980
This is Director Shin's posthumous work.

517
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,710
But its setting is exactly the same as our novel's introduction.

518
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,830
A-Are you saying I plagiarized this scenario or something?

519
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,720
You said you never referenced an actual incident.

520
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,410
This piece was inspired by the victim of the Lake Sopyeong incident.

521
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,710
It's almost the same as our novel's introduction if you take out the revenge part.

522
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,020
I've actually been busy all day because of this.

523
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,570
I heard there was a similar incident, so I was trying to check how similar it was.

524
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,700
Are you saying you didn't know?

525
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,190
I used to live near Lake Sopyeong a long time ago.

526
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,500
I must've heard the story from a family member or a friend

527
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,750
and I didn't realize the story was coming out from my subconscious after hiding in there.

528
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,320
Hey, you claimed it to be fiction in the interviews so much, and now—

529
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,650
We'll correct it now since we realized it.

530
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,330
We can do a correction interview.

531
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,230
You're really impossible.

532
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,230
Why? We can just do a correction interview.

533
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,650
Gosh...

534
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,160
Just stay quiet for now.

535
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,620
No one is interested in the death of a homeless person from 27 years ago.

536
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,000
We can do it once talks about it surface.

537
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,250
Gosh, but the problem is this film studio is talking about plagiarism.

538
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,780
Does a murder case have copyrights or something, huh?

539
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,390
There are more than a couple of works about serial murder at Hwaseong!

540
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,130
Hey, you still have the first date you wrote your novel on your computer. Right?

541
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,640
Why do you ask?

542
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,540
Even in my opinion, the description of the murder is too similar to our novel.

543
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,160
If a dispute happens, it'll be a huge headache.

544
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,290
So let's strike them first and get it over with.

545
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,190
If we can prove the novel was written before the scenario—

546
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,800
Let's just stop this novel.

547
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,100
What?

548
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,610
You're telling me to prove my work to be mine.

549
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,180
I can't do that because my pride won't allow it.

550
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,050
So l-let's stop with this novel.

551
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,890
What do you mean by that?

552
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,760
There's no reason for me to prove it wasn't plagiarized!

553
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,080
Nor do I want to prove it!

554
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,000
I'd rather stop selling it than hear that!

555
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,470
Stop the sales! At once!

556
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,280
Hey, why are you being so emotional—

557
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,780
I'm naturally emotional!

558
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,370
- Hey, you've misunderstood. Sit down— 
 - No, stop the sales! The end! I'm done!

559
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,580
Hey, Dong Joo!

560
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,510
Geez!

561
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,640
- Writer— 
 - Okay, take care.

562
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,620
What's wrong with Writer Yook?

563
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,870
Did you check who owns the copyright...

564
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,270
to Director Shin's scenario?

565
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,880
Since they haven't signed a contract with the film studio, Director Shin's family must have it.

566
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,910
Please contact the bereaved family...

567
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,690
and schedule a meeting.

568
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,990
Sorry?

569
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,130
Let's j-just buy this scenario's copyright...

570
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,250
and settle all of this.

571
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,700
Understood.

572
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,420
That nutcase, seriously...

573
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,080
Gosh...

574
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,850
Man, did I come off too strong?

575
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,360
Geez...

576
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,400
   

577
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,350
Where are you?

578
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,200
The police station?

579
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,620
Why don't you answer me?

580
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,440
Why were you tailing that student?

581
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,340
What were you planning to do to her, huh?

582
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,650
There must be a reason you were following her.

583
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,650
 Because you tried to die. 

584
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,640
 I followed you just in case you killed yourself. 

585
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,680
 I wanted to stop you. 

586
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,900
Are you going to keep quiet?

587
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,850
Why do you care whether I die or not?

588
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,020
You're a stalker, aren't you?

589
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,520
How did you know I was trying to die?

590
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,450
Young lady?

591
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,250
 So what if your grades fall a bit? 

592
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,050
They can't go any lower!

593
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,710
I'm terrified at the thought of my parents being disappointed.

594
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,510
They compare me to my brother and belittle me.

595
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,150
I no longer want to live like this.

596
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,620
Dying is the easier option.

597
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,970
 Why did you come to the police station if you wanted to die? 

598
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,980
I was scared because you kept following me.

599
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,870
 Why were you scared if you were going to die? 

600
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,410
 Live as if you're dead. 

601
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,440
 Live for yourself... 

602
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,540
 not for others. 

603
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,730
 Dying is scarier. 

604
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,560
Young lady.

605
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,300
What are you doing right now?

606
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,660
By chance... are you sick?

607
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,760
No.

608
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,110
Your parents aren't picking up their phones.

609
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,240
- I'll try them one more time, so— 
 - It's okay. Don't call them.

610
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,780
No, no.

611
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,310
There's the situation with him...

612
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,340
- and you're also a bit— 
 - I was just playing around.

613
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,020
Playing around?

614
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
We're friends.

615
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm sorry.

616
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,710
No, no.

617
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,230
Wait here until your parents get here.

618
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,770
Young lady! Wait!

619
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,280
Young lady, where are you going?

620
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,310
You've added stalking to your to-do list now?

621
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,510
I was looking for the right timing, not stalking her.

622
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,480
What timing?

623
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,560
To stop something that can't be undone from happening.

624
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,670
You're able to stop time, too?

625
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,200
She's coming.

626
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,700
- Who is? 
 - Wait!

627
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,160
Give me your cell phone.

628
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,100
I'll katalk you. 
  (Korean SMS) 

629
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,330
Katalk?

630
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,480
Don't brush me off.

631
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,620
If you do, I'll expose your secret.

632
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,890
   

633
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,190
   

634
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,280
What's katalk?

635
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,910
Oh, that means she wants to date you.

636
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,540
What about "brushing her off"?

637
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,320
You'll die if you reject her.

638
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,750
What?

639
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,000
Let's go eat.

640
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,590
   

641
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,000
   
 - Here you go. 
 - Thank you. 

642
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,380
   

643
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,130
Why do you need to look at the yearbook

644
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,480
when you're investigating Director Shin Kyeong Cheol's case?

645
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,330
There's something I'm looking for.

646
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,820
The culprit doesn't happen to be one of our alumni. Right?

647
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,020
If that's the case, please consider our school's reputation...

648
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,040
It's nothing like that.

649
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,910
Okay.

650
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,320
   

651
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,820
   

652
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,510
   

653
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,140
   

654
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,390
   

655
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,320
   

656
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,090
   

657
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,060
   

658
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,040
   

659
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,700
 Excuse me. 

660
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,300
 - Are you a detective? 
 - Yes, what do you need? 

661
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,840
 I'm a bit busy, so make it quick if you have something to say, 

662
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,730
 - or go inside— 
 - A murder case. 

663
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,770
 What? 

664
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,870
 The murder case that took place at Lake Sopyeong. 

665
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,240
 To whom should I speak? 

666
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,340
   

667
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,690
 Do you know something? 

668
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,060
 Huh? 

669
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,070
 Hold on. 

670
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,720
 Hyungnim! 

671
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,060
Of course, I know him.

672
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,570
He was a brilliant student at the top of his class.

673
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,570
Is that so?

674
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,390
Except for once or twice in the 12th grade, he always ranked number one in class.

675
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,580
As you may know, our school is prestigious, so placing first here means nationally—

676
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,440
The school has a contact network. Right?

677
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,130
I'd like to obtain this student's contact info.

678
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,000
He's been reported missing.

679
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,290
Missing?

680
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,760
Some say he's dead.

681
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,000
When was that?

682
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,130
Didn't you say you like rice?

683
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,230
I like hamburgers, too.

684
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,030
Why a hamburger when I was going to buy you top-quality beef?

685
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,190
Hyung, do you have any siblings?

686
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,240
No.

687
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,070
How old were you when your father passed away?

688
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,810
Five years old.

689
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,900
You must not remember him that well.

690
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,090
That's right.

691
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,190
Why don't you live with your mom?

692
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,390
Find yourself instead of questioning me.

693
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,440
Hang a banner first thing tomorrow.

694
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,870
Since I need to find myself.

695
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:58,370
I ought to hang that banner to stop your nagging.

696
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,700
I'm really curious about this.

697
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,530
What does it feel like to have no memories?

698
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,210
I guess you can say it's like being a young child.

699
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,650
To be specific?

700
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,850
Each built-up memory makes you who you are.

701
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:27,350
But you have to learn something new each day since you have no memories.

702
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,330
Like a young child.

703
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,190
That's true.

704
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,860
There are dots scattered everywhere,

705
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,970
but it's frustrating because they don't align.

706
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:41,360
So, you have these so-called scattered dots?

707
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,160
 I'm sorry. 

708
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,410
 I'm sorry, little brother. 

709
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,430
I'm somewhat jealous.

710
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,970
Of what?

711
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,750
You don't have any memories you want to forget or erase.

712
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,220
You just need to build good memories from now on.

713
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,520
Memories are quite wicked.

714
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,150
The memories I want to keep become hazy,

715
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:24,270
and the ones I'm embarrassed about and want to erase keep popping up.

716
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,310
I guess you can be serious at times, too.

717
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,560
Jerk me around, why don't you?

718
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,500
What do you think about Lightning?

719
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,700
What do you mean?

720
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,890
Your name.

721
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:42,470
Since you appeared after being hit by lightning.

722
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,180
I don't like it.

723
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,620
What about Thunder?

724
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,370
Hey, Meteor sounds nice, right? Meteor since you fell out of the sky.

725
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,890
How did you become a writer?

726
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,280
Beats me. It happened, thanks to you. Gosh...

727
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,070
Me?

728
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,920
Hey, Deok Boon sounds good. 
  (Means "Thanks to...") 

729
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,410
Since you appeared like a revelation of God, so Shin Deok Boon. 
  (Shin means "God.") 

730
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,800
How about Cut?

731
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,010
Cut?

732
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,160
Cut-the-crap.

733
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,560
Get over here!

734
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,830
You're getting cheeky.

735
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,510
Hey, what about No-name?

736
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,570
Since you don't have a name.

737
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,810
It's the best so far.

738
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:27,700
Since you're a miracle boy who came back from the dead, how does Gi Jeok sound? 
  (Gi Jeok means "miracle.") 

739
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,240
Gi Jeok. Gi Jeok, Gi Jeok...

740
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,520
Gosh, that won't work. It sounds like a diaper.

741
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:44,440
Whoa.

742
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,520
This is your office?

743
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,000
It's so grand.

744
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,140
It's just spacious. There's nothing much else.

745
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,150
And it's not even mine.

746
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,410
Change into my clothes for now

747
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,160
and let's shop for your clothes and necessities tomorrow.

748
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,280
I'll leave once I find my family, so let's just buy what I need.

749
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,210
You read all of these books?

750
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,390
Books aren't meant to be read in the first place.

751
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,970
They provide inner peace just by being there.

752
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,620
Also, that's your bedroom.

753
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,160
But your bed is coming tomorrow.

754
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,880
So you can sleep on the couch today.

755
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,960
Don't you have a blanket?

756
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,010
I can just sleep on the floor with a blanket.

757
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,750
Blanket, my ass.

758
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,340
Also, this is my workspace.

759
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,820
So absolutely don't intrude.

760
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,840
What's that?

761
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,210
It's a laptop. What else?

762
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,340
Gosh, seriously.

763
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,450
Don't come in here since it's my workspace.

764
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,000
Do I need to put a partition here?

765
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,160
I'm sure I locked it.

766
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,440
What's wrong?

767
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,300
Huh?

768
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,140
N-No, it's nothing.

769
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,910
   

770
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,820
I mean...

771
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,330
I don't need anything else.

772
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,880
Just find what I told you.

773
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,600
Yes, okay.

774
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,700
What are you looking for?

775
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,660
They're still not here?

776
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,390
What are you going to do with the videotape?

777
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,440
The statute of limitations is up anyway.

778
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,570
The rats will hear you.

779
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,690
Watch what you say.

780
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:55,120
Be honest with me.

781
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,070
You killed Jeon Doo Hyeon, huh?

782
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,650
Well, I know who killed him.

783
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,350
You're not the one, are you?

784
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,290
Goodness!

785
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,490
Sorry to make you wait.

786
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,430
Welcome, Assemblyman Byeon.

787
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,120
Smile a little.

788
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,800
   

789
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,870
Did you find it?

790
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,760
   

791
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:58,470
Go wash up first and get changed. I put your clothes in the bathroom.

792
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,670
What's the hurry with washing up?

793
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,110
Gosh, hurry up and wash.

794
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,500
Why do you keep telling me to wash? Are you a germaphobe?

795
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,480
Yes. I have germaphobia and OCD, so go wash up.

796
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,980
There. The bathroom is over there.

797
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,900
- Hurry .
 - Gosh, you're really a weird one.

798
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,040
- Wash every nook and cranny! 
 - I'll just jump in and out!

799
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,360
Come on! Seriously.

800
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,310
   

801
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,180
Hyung!

802
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,910
W-Why? W-What now?

803
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,700
I chose my name.

804
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,010
- W-Which one did you choose? 
 - Gi Jeok! 
  (Gi Jeok means "miracle.") 

805
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,200
I told you it sounds weird.

806
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,310
It doesn't matter!

807
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,090
   

808
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,680
   

809
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,600
   

810
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:18,120
Jeon Doo Hyeon, who got murdered two years ago, is the key witness in this case.

811
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,750
You and Assemblyman Byeon were in charge.

812
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:27,220
I didn't know about it during the investigation two years ago because it wasn't recorded in the database.

813
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:32,080
But you knew about both Jeon Doo Hyeon and this case, so why didn't you say anything?

814
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,700
What are you hiding?

815
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,530
Is the culprit arrested 27 years ago really the actual culprit?

816
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,100
What the hell happened 27 years ago?

817
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:53,000
 Hey, you! 

818
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,820
 Ending this faster will be easier for you. 

819
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,870
 You can't even sleep. Why go through this? 

820
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,710
 Shall we start from the beginning? 

821
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,400
 I looked the other way, although it bothered me. 

822
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:46,010
My oldest child was on the verge of death because of a heart disorder. I couldn't care about anything else.

823
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,990
Senior Byeon told me to stay with my child, even giving me money.

824
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,050
So I said I'll do that.

825
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,910
I was really grateful to him back then.

826
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,680
During that time, he got the confession, handed him over to the prosecution,

827
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,760
and the investigation came to an end overnight.

828
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:17,390
The student who had come to you... The student named Lee Ha Neul...

829
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,750
Is he alive right now?

830
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,550
Is he dead by chance?

831
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,100
He went missing.

832
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,720
He's most likely dead.

833
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,350
How did you know?

834
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,240
Why did you think he was dead?

835
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,490
It's a long story.

836
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,910
What's clear is that the incident from 27 years ago is

837
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:44,520
the beginning and the motivation for the serial killing happening right now.

838
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,900
   

839
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,520
Did you look into it?

840
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,220
 I didn't have time to go to the National Archives. 

841
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,780
Okay.

842
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,880
- It's mine. 
 - There are two, though.

843
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,340
 Are you listening to me? 

844
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,510
Yes, yes. Go ahead.

845
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,870
The principal?

846
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,770
 Yes. According to my father... 

847
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:53,250
the principal would know best about the incident from 27 years ago.

848
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,620
I don't know the specifics.

849
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,850
Didn't the principal want to meet you?

850
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,000
Go see him and ask him in person.

851
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
   

852
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,290
Hello!

853
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,700
Hey, you made it!

854
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,070
- You've been well. Right? 
 - Yes, of course.

855
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,640
I need to go take care of my bathroom business.

856
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,360
So you can wait inside.

857
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,100
I must've eaten something wrong, and it's been like this for a while now.

858
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,000
- Please take your time. 
 - Okay.

859
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,220
Congrats on publishing your novel.

860
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,580
Thank you.

861
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,030
Gosh. Now, now.

862
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,250
Okay, okay.

863
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,560
Gosh, my belly.

864
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,490
 Are you saying Cheon Na Ra is also involved in this incident? 

865
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,920
 Yes, but it was done during the daytime. 

866
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,210
 It's far from the nighttime, at which Eun Hye said she saw Jang Gi. 

867
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,800
   

868
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,420
   

869
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,720
Man, he's sure taking long.

870
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,600
Gosh.

871
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,200
   
   

872
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,960
Did they form sister affiliations with schools abroad back then?

873
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,990
   

874
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:42,410

 Just wait for me. 

882

 Writer, are you in there? 

883
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:12,820
 The link between the two people. 

884
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,880
 This book is what links them two together. 

885
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,540
 Don't investigate based on your imagination. 

886
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,660
 Novels can't catch up to reality. 

887

 Meeting someone who passed away is impossible. 

888
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,690
 You remember this student. Right? 

889
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,540
 What did this student tell you, Hyungnim? 

890
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,350
 He didn't tell you why he's looking for Lee Kang San? 

891
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:30,180
 - It wasn't Kang San...  
  - He's not a runaway! 

892
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,750
 He was looking for Kang San's brother. 

893
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,650
 Is the picture in your study your family picture? 

894
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,720
 Is the man in the picture your father? 

895
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,770
 What's Lee Kang San's brother's name? 

896
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,630
 Sky. 

897
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,450
 Sorry?
