1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,230
   

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,570
What the heck is this?

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,610
How can he look so much alike?

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:32,000


5
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,930
   
   

6
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,760
   

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,380
1995?

8
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,380
Twins don't make sense.

9
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,540
A doppelganger?

10
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,930
No, no, no.

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,690
Father?

12
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,300
Yes, that makes sense.

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,240
Still, how can he look this much alike?

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
Even their hairstyles are the same.

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,370
 Who's there? 

16
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,370
 It's the police. 

17
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,040
 Y-You're going to wear that? 

18
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,590
He's got the same shoes on, too.

19
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,810
 Please open the door. It's the police! 

20
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,260
 Go out the back door. 

21
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,030
 Hurry! 

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,550
 Go out the back door. 

23
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,560
 Hurry! 

24
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,260
 What about Hyung? Where is he? 

25
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,080
 I'm going to get out of this place. Just wait for me. 

26
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
 Stop cursing! 

27
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,460
 I'm not your fucking son. 

28
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,060
What's this sound?

29
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,170
Yook Dong Joo!

30
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,380
Writer, are you in there?

31
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,220
What's the matter, Yook Dong Joo?

32
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,410
 Don't trust anyone. 

33
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,790
 Don't ever go to the orphanage. 

34
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,640
 Hurry up and go. Quickly! 

35
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,780
They're the same people?

36
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,360
1995...

37
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,560
There's no way...

38
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,440
   

39
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,130
Who's inside right now, then?

40
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,150
 What exactly is the matter? 

41
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,010
- What's the passcode? 
 - Why are you trying to go into my house?

42
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,680
Something's happening inside, for sure!

43
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,470
What do you mean something is happening?

44
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,680
That's what I want to go in and check! What's the passcode?

45
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,250
Are detectives allowed to break into people's homes as they please?

46
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm carrying out my public duty.

47
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,380
I'll tear down the door if I have to—

48
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,930
- It opened. 
  - S-Sorry? 

49
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,290
I'll check and call you back.

50
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,390
H-Hello—

51
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,480
Gosh, my goodness.

52
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,660
What did he do this time? Let me check the CCTV.

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,190
Huh?

54
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,790
Why was this turned off?

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,160
- Oh, yes, Principal— 
 - Sorry for making you wait.

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Principal, I'm sorry. Something urgent just came up.

57
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,190
I'll call you and come back next time!

58
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm really sorry!

59
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,250
I'll make sure to come back!

60
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,930
What's going on right now? What did you do this time?

61
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,690
It's just that something happened.

62
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,770
 What the heck is that something? 

63
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,290
The picture in your study... Is that your family picture?

64
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,440
- Yes, it is. 
  - Is the man in the picture your father? 

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,650
Yes, but why are you asking?

66
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,150
 When will you be home? 

67
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,340
Just tell me what you did!

68
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,460
Did you see and hear things again?

69
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,450
 It's similar but hard to explain. 

70
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,080
I-I'll be there in a minute, so stay put.

71
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,270
And never tell the detective about it.

72
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,480
 About what? 

73
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,600
What else? Your secret. I'm sure she wouldn't believe you anyway.

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,380
Hang up now!

75
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,860
Who was it?

76
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,160
Who did all this?

77
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,970
Tell me. What happened here?

78
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,290
I was alone.

79
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,010
Could there be... another entrance to this house?

80
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,380
How did they escape?

81
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,080
I did this.

82
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,720
Do you happen to remember this student?

83
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,330
Kang San?

84
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,230
- Kang San? 
 - Yes.

85
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,080
Lee Kang San.

86
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,740
I was his homeroom teacher.

87
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,040
Do you know what this person is doing and where?

88
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,160
Why are you suddenly asking about Kang San?

89
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,050
Oh, the thing is...

90
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,370
It's because I'm doing background research for my next work.

91
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,110
So you're saying you did all this on your own but can't tell me the reason?

92
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,360
Yes.

93
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,910
And you expect me to believe that?

94
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,840
It's the truth.

95
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,120
Why can't you tell me the reason?

96
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,140
- Because it's a secret. 
 - What's this secret?

97
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,970
- You won't believe it even if I told you. 
 - I'll believe you.

98
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,020
So tell me.

99
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,930
I have superpowers.

100
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,510
Are you trying to mess with me?

101
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,580
See?

102
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,450
Cut the nonsense and tell me honestly.

103
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,670
There was someone else here. Right?

104
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,910
Is he someone close to Yook Dong Joo?

105
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,500
Did you get threatened by that person?

106
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,370
I told you this happened because of me.

107
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,420
You don't have to be afraid, and you can tell me.

108
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll help you out.

109
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,570
I have met Hyung's father before.

110
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,950
He disappeared?

111
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,540
Are you saying he went missing?

112
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,130
Yes, he vanished without a trace.

113
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,920
When did this happen? When did Lee Kang San disappear?

114
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,030
You met Yook Dong Joo's father?

115
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,640
Yes.

116
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,350
I remember him.

117
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,870
That's impossible.

118
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,540
   

119
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,280
He passed away long before you were born. 
    

120
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,890
But I remembered meeting him.

121
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,810
There must be an error in your memories.

122
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,100
He's the one who gave me the bag.

123
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,670
- He gave me the bag. 
 - What bag?

124
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,260
The bag I had when I got hit by the car.

125
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,440
You had a bag with you?

126
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,090
Yes.

127
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,380
 Did the victim not have any belongings? 

128
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,240
 No. 

129
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,450
Where is your bag right now?

130
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,770
Didn't you have anything in it that we can use to identify you with?

131
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,200
- He said there wasn't. 
 - You didn't check it yourself?

132
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
Hyung lost it.

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,540
- He lost it? 
 - Yes.

134
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,420
But you're sure you had a bag with you?

135
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm sure. This man gave me the bag.

136
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,410
Meeting someone who passed away is impossible.

137
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,710
That's true, but...

138
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,570
It could be some sort of PTSD.

139
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,740
More importantly, tell me honestly what happened here.

140
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm not sure what the truth is.

141
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,070
Does truth even exist?

142
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,920
What do you mean?

143
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,980
If you don't believe it... even the truth isn't true anymore.

144
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,470
 It was torn down and moved to a new location... 

145
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:20,390
but he lived with his brother at a church-run facility called Cheonyoung Orphanage.

146
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,360
They say misfortune comes in pairs, but how could both brothers go missing at once?

147
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,190
The novel was a story about himself.

148
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,220
It'll take forever to clean all this up.

149
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,760
When's the writer coming?

150
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,380
- I don't know. 
 - Where did he go?

151
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,630
He didn't tell me.

152
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,480
Hey, did you find it?

153
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,010
Okay, I'll be on my way.

154
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,610
   

155
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,560
   

156
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,420
   
   

157
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,280
I was going to help you clean, but it looks like I'll have to go.

158
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,070
You don't need to meet Hyung?

159
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,970
I'll call him.

160
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,080
Also, let me know whenever you want to tell me something or if there's a problem.

161
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,230
Whenever it may be.

162
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,510
Okay.

163
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,470
I'm leaving now.

164
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,100
   

165
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,370
   
   

166
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,460
 The novel? 

167
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,000
   

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,620
The truth behind the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago is written in this book.

169
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,840
Only the victim and the culprit know the truth.

170
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,440
Of course, we can't be sure the story from the novel is the truth regarding the incident from 27 years ago.

171
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,400
However, Shin Kyeong Cheol and Jeon Doo Hyeon's death scenes

172
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,180
were described almost identically in the novel.

173
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,060
And the narrator resembles Lee Ha Neul, who went missing.

174
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,270
I became certain after listening to what you said.

175
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,720
Jeon Doo Hyeon isn't the witness of the Lake Sopyeong incident from 27 years ago.

176
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,190
It's Lee Ha Neul who's missing.

177
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,790
Are you saying Lee Ha Neul is exacting revenge?

178
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,850
It's more than possible.

179
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,760
Lee Ha Neul is alive.

180
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,130
Yook Dong Joo is connected to Lee Ha Neul, whether as the main culprit or an accomplice.

181
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,910
The link between the two people?

182
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,070
They lived in the same neighborhood 27 years ago.

183
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,240
- And? 
 - This book is what links them together—

184
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
Why don't you come to your senses?

185
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,140
- Don't investigate based on your imagination. 
 - Try reading it!

186
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,490
It'll change your mind. One can't write this novel solely on imagination.

187
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:02,140
Even if it makes total sense, it's only a novel without proper evidence.

188
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,780
   
   

189
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,690
   
   
   

190
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,570
Kai?

191
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,620
 Kang San's brother was really extraordinary. 

192
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,540
I heard he was always first place in Taekang High School, where only elite students go.

193
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,940
He was good at drawing and writing, too.

194
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,420
In short, he was a genius.

195
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,890
But no one looked for him?

196
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,290
Are you saying neither the police nor his school tried to look for him?

197
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,610
Well, the police said it was a simple runaway case.

198
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,810
And he didn't have a family, either.

199
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,990
But you were there.

200
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,950
Even if the police didn't, his school should've looked for him.

201
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,970
I wasn't even that school's teacher.

202
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,600
But Lee Kang San was this school's student.

203
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,410
How come no one tried to find two brothers who vanished into thin air?

204
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,750
You said the older one was a genius and a prodigy!

205
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,730
Why would such a student run away without reason?

206
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,270
Did you come to judge me about that?

207
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,260
How dare you yell like that?

208
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,180
G-Gosh, I-I'm sorry.

209
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,100
So, you have no fear now that you've become a bit famous?

210
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,000
No, that's not it. I-I just got worked up.

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,100
Kang San had a close friend.

212
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,910
He's working as a teacher here.

213
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,760
So go meet him.

214
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,830
 How many times do I have to tell you? 

215
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,650
 Hyung didn't run away from home. There's no reason. 

216
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,720
 Something must've happened to him. 

217
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,840
 Okay, so leave now. 

218
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,340
 He didn't run away! 

219
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,830
 - So what do you want me to do? 
 - You need to find him! 

220
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,290
 The police shouldn't be sitting around like this. 

221
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,400
 Gosh, even a fucking brat is giving me bullshit. 

222
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,600
 How dare you glare at me like that? 

223
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,870
 The police shouldn't be like this. 

224
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,560
 The police need to find him! 

225
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,850
 Where will we find a fucking orphan who ran off on his own two feet? 

226
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,760
 You can go find him if you want! 

227
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,890
 Do orphans... not deserve to be protected by the police? 

228
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,430
 If you don't have parents, we're not citizens of this country? 

229
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,740
 This fucking asshole! 

230
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,090
 You sure make it obvious how uneducated you are. 

231
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,160
 Leave. 

232
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,550
 - I'm telling you to do your job as the police! 
 - What? 

233
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,600
 - This fucking bastard— 
 - Stop cursing! 

234
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,440
 I'm not your fucking son. 

235
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,180
 You didn't even bother trying to look for my brother. 

236
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,520
 You never intended so in the first place! 

237
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,170
 - Do your job as the police! 
 - Come outside! 

238
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,700
 Let go! Let go of me! 

239
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,900
 - He's not a runaway! 
 - Kang San! 

240
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,590
That was...

241
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,340
the last time I saw Kang San.

242
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,960
Was there anything odd about Lee Kang San, by chance?

243
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,950
Do you think Lee Kang San is your friend?

244
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,840
He's a senior who's way older than you are.

245
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,810
Gosh, gosh. I-I'm sorry.

246
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,070
Something odd?

247
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,520
Yes, a trait that can be used to identify Lee Kang San.

248
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,740
By chance... did you find Kang San's corpse or something?

249
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,240
G-Gosh, i-it's not like that. It's just research for my novel.

250
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,090
- Cut the crap and tell me the truth. 
 - It's really the truth!

251
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,330
Why would I lie to you, Senior?

252
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,440
Because it's weird.

253
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,820
Earlier today, a detective came out of nowhere to look into Kang San's student record.

254
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,960
And now... you're asking about Kang San as well.

255
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,430
A d-detective?

256
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,540
Was it a female detective?

257
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,400
No.

258
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,580
   

259
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,080
You remember this student, right?

260
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,020
Is he someone I need to remember?

261
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,900
Twenty-seven years ago...

262
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,150
he came to me saying he had something to say about the Lake Sopyeong incident.

263
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,300
 The murder case that took place at Lake Sopyeong. 

264
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,000
 To whom should I speak? 

265
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,320
 Do you know something? Huh? 

266
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,710
 Hold on. 

267
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,730
 Hyungnim! 

268
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,430
 And I left him in your care. 

269
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,180
Did you?

270
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,910
What did this student tell you, Hyungnim?

271
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,560
 Is everything you told me the truth? 

272
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,500
 It's the truth. 

273
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,350
 Did you... tell anyone else about this, by chance? 

274
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,940
 No. 

275
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,670
 Good. 

276
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,210
 I'm sure you know, but the people we have to fight aren't regular folks. 

277
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,460
 You and I could both end up dead as well. 

278
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,560
 I'm aware of that. 

279
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,200
 By the way... your testimony alone isn't enough to prove it. 

280
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,650
 I-I have proof. 

281
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,440
 - Proof? 
 - Yes. 

282
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,810
 There's a videotape. 

283
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:29,200
I have no recollection, so it must've been some useless talk.

284
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,030
By the way... as you did last time,

285
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,450
why do you keep digging up a case that's been over with for ages?

286
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,320
Because it doesn't look like it's over.

287
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,490
He didn't tell you why he was looking for Lee Kang San?

288
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,730
It wasn't Kang San.

289
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,890
He was looking for Kang San's brother.

290
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,060
His brother?

291
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,580
Yes.

292
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,730
I think he found out Kang San went missing when he came here.

293
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,370
Kang San has a scar on his back.

294
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,310
I happened to see it, so I pretended not to have seen it.

295
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,950
 It looked like a scar from getting beaten. 

296
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,990
If you happen to find Kang San, let me know.

297
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,640
I must tell him something.

298
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,910
Please hit me just once.

299
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,260
Hit me just once, Senior. I'm not sure if this is a dream or reality—

300
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,810
Ouch.

301
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,420
It's indeed reality.

302
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,990
Take care.

303
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,950
What's hisname?

304
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,360
What's Lee Kang San's older brother's name?

305
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,880
Ha Neul. 
  (Haneul means sky in Korean) 

306
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,020
Sorry?

307
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,710
Sky.

308
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,120
Lee Ha Neul.

309
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,010
Lee Ha Neul?

310
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,760
Dong Joo!

311
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,170
Hey, did you meet the principal?

312
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,190
Yeah...

313
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,210
Is something wrong?

314
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,390
What's the matter?

315
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,190
I wrote a novel.

316
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,190
What?

317
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,060
On a day when there's rain with thunder and lightning...

318
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,440
a hole in spacetime was created like a blackhole,

319
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,100
which allowed the protagonist to travel through time to the future.

320
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,990
- Is it your next work? 
 - Hear me out.

321
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,530
 Ouch! 

322
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,710
 But as soon as he arrived, he got hit by a car. 

323
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,140
 Because he appeared out of nowhere as if he was pulled out of thin air. 

324
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,780
He can't even call the ambulance because his phone's all broken.

325
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,700
That's why I— No, no, no!

326
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,370
The driver of the car takes him to the hospital.

327
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,550
But they said he died.

328
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,850
 The patient has passed away. 

329
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,400
He was announced dead.

330
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,130
But he came back to life, opening his eyes like a miracle.

331
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,470
He came back but couldn't remember anything, including his name.

332
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,920
But he has a superpower that lets him hear people's suffering and teleports from anywhere, too.

333
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,810
Don't write about this.

334
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,900
Right? T-This is nonsense, right?

335
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,180
I mean, it's not nonsense for an SF novel. But it's bland.

336
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,490
I-It's bland?

337
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,590
It's so shocking for me!

338
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,420
Hey, Yong Dae... in fact, I used...

339
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,090
- a novel written by a serial killer— 
 - Whoa!

340
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,590
Yes, that's it.

341
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,170
Put serial murder in it!

342
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,540
I can tell this one will be a big hit!

343
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,320
G-Go write it out first.

344
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,670
Thanks.

345
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,960
Man, don't mention it.

346
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,290
I can breathe now that I've told someone.

347
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,870
Hey, I need to go.

348
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,550
Laters!

349
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,660
Yes, Chief. Yes, I'm on my way. Yes.

350
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,790
Lee Ha Neul...

351
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,390
Sky... Sky...

352
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,540
Kai?

353
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,970
Sky.

354
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,990
Kai.

355
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,370
Are his treatments over?

356
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,120
- I went to see him just now and— 
 - Detective Park!

357
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,500
...he seemed unstable for some reason.

358
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,080
Oh, it's probably because his memories aren't completely restored yet.

359
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,960
Yes, you don't need to worry about it.

360
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,390
Hello.

361
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,400
How are you feeling?

362
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,100
I have no difficulty doing daily tasks... for now.

363
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,790
You don't have one showing his face?

364
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,850
Look at the next one.

365
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,070
It's this man who wanted the package delivered to you.

366
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,570
I don't think he intended to hide his face.

367
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,810
Where did I see him?

368
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,120
   

369
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,240
I told you not to buy this.

370
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,830
It's about time for your refills.

371
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,770
Wait a minute.

372
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,330
I'll give you the money.

373
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,300
Wait, just count it even for the dry cleaning fee.

374
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,020
You don't even get things dry-cleaned. Here, take it.

375
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,320
No, that's too much.

376
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,630
Gosh, you bought so many for me already!

377
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,140
Gosh, okay. I'll take it.

378
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,280
Is your knee pain better now?

379
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,100
Well, it's a chronic illness.

380
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,800
But taking the meds seems to improve it.

381
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,620
I'm glad.

382
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,810
    
 Noh Myeong Nam is the one who sent me the novel.

383
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,050
I'm sure of it.

384
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,780
I checked his picture a few days ago while looking up his release date.

385
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,140
And I checked it again just now.

386
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Did you meet him?

387
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,440
   

388
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,970
Thank you.

389
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,740
Jeon Doo Hyeon was murdered two years ago.

390
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,540
You're aware. Right?

391
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,010
   

392
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,390
Noh Myeong Nam ran away. I'll send his license plate number.

393
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,120
Issue a warrant on the car and track his phone.

394
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,610
Yes.

395
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,480
Writer Yook!

396
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,540
Why won't you answer your phone?

397
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,350
I'm sorry, but I have a bad headache right now.

398
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,110
I placed the bed just where you said you wanted it.

399
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,010
Oh, okay. Thank you. I'll send the bed cost to the publishing company's account.

400
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,110
Please forget about it now. CEO Lee is resolving the issue regarding Director Shin's script—

401
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,860
- That's not even important. 
 - I understand how you feel—

402
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,520
- N-No, no one can understand me! 
 - I do!

403
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,540
Plagiarism is taboo for writers.

404
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,710
To be real, there's nothing new under the sun.

405
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,710
Are all writers who came after Shakespeare plagiarizing him, then?

406
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,480
Can't we talk later? I have a huge headache right now.

407
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,260
I'm sure CEO Lee also had a headache.

408
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,760
Similar works do come out around the same time.

409
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,300
But they were indeed too similar.

410
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,610
So, what parts were that similar, and in what way specifically?

411
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,990
They both take place at a lake, and the murders are described the same way.

412
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,400
In the actual case, the culprit was caught. Right?

413
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
But the case was covered up in the novel.

414
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,370
The script has the same plot.

415
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,350
The culprits are powerful families' kids in high school.

416
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,870
Are you saying the circumstances of the murders are the same?

417
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,480
Surprisingly so.

418
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,200
But I'm not saying you plagiarized, so don't misunderstand me.

419
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,790
The stories progress completely differently in the latter part.

420
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:45,310
By the way, did Director Shin graduate from Taekang High School?

421
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,130
I think so.

422
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,700
I think I read it in a magazine interview.

423
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,690
   

424
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,370
   

425
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,400
 Come on, let go! 

426
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,420
   

427
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,170
   

428
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,750
   

429
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,980
   

430
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,830
   

431
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,930
   

432
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,010
 Kill him! 

433
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,070
   

434
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,340
 Let me! Let me! 

435
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,350
   

436
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,360
   

437
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,920
 Die, you bastard! 

438
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,630
 Hell is empty... 

439
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,250
 and all the demons are here. 

440
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,930
   

441
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,720
Where'd he go?

442
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,500
Why won't it work?

443
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,160
- Excuse me? 
 - Yes?

444
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,080
Why won't he pick up his phone?

445
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,670
Hey, Lee Kang San— I mean... Lee Gi Jeok! Where are you?

446
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,320
 My last name is Lee? 

447
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,800
Lee or Kim, where are you?

448
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,590
Where are you going when you don't even know the way?

449
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,570
I can just use my phone's navigation.

450
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,190
I have plans. I need to meet someone.

451
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,310
Who would you even meet?

452
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,780
You think I have no one to meet?

453
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,530
- Who is it? 
 - Someone.

454
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,930
- I asked who is it? 
 - None of your business.

455
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,300
That female student?

456
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,840
It's not.

457
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,990
It is.

458
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,300
I'll pay you back later.

459
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,210
   

460
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,360
   

461
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,200
   

462
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,540
I must meet him before the police find him.

463
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,300
   

464
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,580
Dying is the worst that could happen.

465
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,960
   

466
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,100
Gosh...

467
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,050
   

468
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,050
It's a photo of him from 27 years ago. He's currently 46 years old.

469
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,690
We can obtain an age progression montage. Right?

470
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,050
Who is this?

471
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,480
I ask you this favor.

472
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,730
How could I say no when it's a favor for Detective Park?

473
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,690
Thank you.

474
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,030
Yes.

475
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,170
Noh Myeong Nam's phone is off.

476
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,580
We found his car nearby.

477
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,960
I'll head back for now. Let's talk then.

478
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,290
This is Park Hyeon Soo.

479
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,300
 I didn't kill him. 

480
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,120
Noh Myeong Nam? You're Noh Myeong Nam, aren't you?

481
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,020
 I didn't kill him. I didn't kill anyone. 

482
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,300
Let's meet and talk. I'll head over to where you are.

483
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,640
I won't fall for it this time.

484
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,730
I won't fall for it twice.

485
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,670
I'll believe you. I believe you.

486
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,110
So let's meet up. If you run away, you'll become a suspect—

487
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,180
What the hell are you thinking?

488
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,880
Why are you digging up a closed case instead of investigating what you're supposed to?

489
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,190
- Well... 
 - I'm getting pressured from above, my junior's fumbling around, and the press is talking shit.

490
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,860
I'm working my ass off! What are you doing by yourself? Aren't you Violent Crimes Team 3?

491
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,550
You think you're all that? You need to share information!

492
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,000
I was going to tell you.

493
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,990
When? After I'm dead?

494
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,850
The Sopyeong Lake incident from 27 years ago

495
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,160
is the motive behind the Shin Kyeong Cheol/Jeon Doo Hyeon case.

496
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,090
What do you mean? Explain so I can understand.

497
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,890
Let me explain.

498
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,900
The case from 27 years ago was covered up

499
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,280
and it was the motive for Shin Kyeong Cheol/Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder case?

500
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,520
Yes. The culprits are in the photo found in Jeon Doo Hyeon's pocket, Chairman Lee Tae Man and—

501
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,500
Hey, get out.

502
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,680
- Team Leader Oh... 
 - Didn't you hear what I said?

503
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,230
Okay.

504
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,850
Hyungnim, you know what you're implying, don't you?

505
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,920
Byeon Jong Il, an incumbent lawmaker and former detective,

506
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,610
was encouraged by powerful elites to cover up the case.

507
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,900
And I'm also an accomplice.

508
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,720
What's gotten into you? You shouldn't do this without any evidence.

509
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,630
I was in charge of this case. Aside from everything else,

510
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,280
it's highly likely that Noh Myeong Nam isn't the culprit of the case from 27 years ago.

511
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,780
Wait a minute.

512
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,190
So Noh Myeong Nam is the one who killed Shin Kyeong Cheol and Jeon Doo Hyeon?

513
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,540
Based on the call Detective Park received from Noh Myeong Nam, we don't think he's the culprit.

514
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,190
You said he ran away. Why would he run if he's innocent?

515
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,730
I'm not sure.

516
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,650
In any case, I'm certain the case from 27 years ago is the key to solving this one.

517
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,110
Whether it's true or not, you know what will happen if this story gets out.

518
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,590
The entire police force will be criticized.

519
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,110
Some higher-ups will be stripped of their uniforms. Including me.

520
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,480
You might be stripped before you even start to investigate.

521
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,080
Hyungnim,

522
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,470
let's bury the case with the expired statute of limitations and just catch the culprit for this case.

523
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,180
If we want to catch this culprit, we need to dig up the past.

524
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,310
We'll see blood if we rush into this without solid evidence. You know that!

525
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,470
So we should find that evidence.

526
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,970
You think any evidence remains after 27 years?

527
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,030
Man Bok.

528
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,440
What?

529
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
I retire next year.

530
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,850
Exactly! You should retire honorably!

531
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,170
You suffered for decades without a personal life. Why would you knock that all down?

532
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,150
It's worth knocking down.

533
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,830
Hyungnim!

534
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,610
Help me investigate properly this time so I have no regrets when I die.

535
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,870
That's how we can stop these murders.

536
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,620
You want to meet Dong Joo?

537
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,160
He's the rising star of our publishing company. I want to encourage him.

538
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,780
There's no need. He's not some incredible writer worth your time, Hyungnim.

539
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:42,640
The manuscript was originally meant to be submitted to a contest.

540
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,390
But I came across it by chance and decided to publish it.

541
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,410
He didn't bring it to you?

542
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,940
I'm the one who made the publishing offer.

543
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,840
I read it without much expectation, and it was better than I expected.

544
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:05,600
We'll know if it was just pure luck or actual skill when his follow-up work comes out.

545
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,900
Let me meet that Yook Dong Joo.

546
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
What are you doing?

547
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,400
Writer Yoo left a strange post.

548
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,580
A strange post?

549
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,130
"What kind of ending do you want?"

550
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,640
"Is it light or darkness?"

551
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,690
"Kai, which side are you?"

552
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,090
What is this?

553
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,920
It's a writer's tearful effort to communicate with the readers. What else?

554
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,440
 This isn't communication. It's masturbation. 

555
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,290
Only people who can communicate can interpret it, so you need some imagination.

556
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,170
You're getting quite cheeky these days.

557
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,180
- I'm doing well these days. 
 - Be more modest while you're doing well.

558
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,130
And "Dong Joo's letter to Ha Neul"?

559
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,300
Wow! What age are you living in?

560
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,470
Do you think a glass-jar letter idea is trendy now?

561
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,030
Take it down.

562
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,790
The readers' respect for you will plummet along with sales.

563
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,460
Hemmingway also completed his novel with six words.

564
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,730
"For Sale: Baby shoes, never worn."

565
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,290
Gosh, forget it. Just forget it.

566
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,900
Hey, my brother wants to meet with you. Make yourself available tomorrow.

567
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,690
Why would your brother want to meet me?

568
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,340
- He wants to encourage you. 
 - Encourage?

569
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,050
Dress properly and formally. Don't make a fool out of yourself.

570
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,630
- Is this a blind date? 
 - Do you know who you're meeting?

571
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,420
It's Chairman Lee Tae Man of Taekang Group.

572
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,030
Exactly, so why would the great chairman of Taekang Group want to meet with a mere—

573
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,820
   

574
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,650
My brother considerately made this opportunity since you're my friend,

575
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,330
so get off your high horse and just come.

576
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,020
Are you listening?

577
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,780
Your brother...

578
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,390
read my novel. Right?

579
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,550
 Stop digressing and just make the time. 

580
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,100
You think I c-come and go if you tell me to?

581
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,470
I-I'm a bit sick.

582
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,760
I have a fever and a cough. Not sure if it's a cold or the flu.

583
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,990
 - Take medicine then.  
 - Anyway, I have my own schedule.

584
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,000
I'll check and let you know. Hang up for now.

585
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,410
 

586
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,290
Lee Tae Man...

587
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,250
I think it's around here somewhere.

588
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,020
   

589
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,130
   

590
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,790
I think I'm nearby, but I don't see you.

591
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,500
 What do you see around you? 

592
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,240
I'm in front of a playground.

593
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,400
And there is a cafe across from it.

594
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,210
And I also see a church.

595
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,760
 You just need to walk a bit past the church. 

596
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,220
Well...

597
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,810
 What's wrong? 

598
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,370
   
 Open the door! 

599
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,370
 Open the door! 

600
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,660
 Please open the door. 

601
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,800
   

602
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,600
   

603
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,330
 Hello? 

604
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,290
 Young man? 

605
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,900
   

606
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,720
Man, how refreshing!

607
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,300
This is...

608
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,520
Mister, where is this?

609
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,170
Excuse me—

610
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,030
Why did I come here?

611
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,540
 The Sopyeong Lake case is the starting point of all the cases. 

612
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,630
Jeon Doo Hyeon, who was murdered and a witness of the case 27 years ago,

613
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,990
identified Noh Myeong Nam as the culprit.

614
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,350
Noh Myeong Nam was released from prison two years ago after serving 25 years,

615
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,990
and we're currently tracking his whereabouts.

616
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,500
They were all children of powerful families.

617
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,770
Their parents, who had both money and power,

618
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,820
put forth a fake witness, Jeon Doo Hyeon,

619
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,540
to frame a powerless homeless man, Noh Myeong Nam, as the culprit.

620
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,460
There was someone else who witnessed the incident at the time.

621
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,880
- He's currently reported missing— 
 - There was a witness?

622
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,520
It's the student who sought me out during my investigation.

623
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,790
His name is Lee Ha Neul.

624
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,990
He attended the same high school with them.

625
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,040
Let me ask you one thing.

626
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,280
How are you so sure that the case from 27 years ago

627
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,700
was covered up, and they're the real culprits?

628
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,960
The culprit who murdered Shin Kyeong Cheol and Jeon Doo Hyeon left a message at the scene.

629
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,240
One of them is a photograph of them found on Jeon Doo Hyeon's body.

630
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,390
That's your evidence for accusing them of the crime?

631
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,660
Not just that...

632
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,380
You shouldn't mention the novel for now.

633
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,840
They may just distrust you.

634
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,030
I'll tell you about the other evidence after we find the body of the missing Na Sang Woo.

635
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:46,280
- Find the body? 
 - I have an idea where the body might be.

636
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,560
I request support. I'll find it within two days.

637
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,840
- Are you confident? 
 - Yes.

638
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,260
I think I know which grave the culprit chose.

639
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,960
Hey, Gi Jeok!

640
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,410
You said you had plans.

641
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,170
Why on earth did you come here?

642
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:26,100
- I don't know. 
 - Who does, if you don't?

643
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,800
Exactly.

644
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,050
How did you get here?

645
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:36,700
I was somewhere else, but I ended up here once I came to.

646
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,920
You just came?

647
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,110
You didn't see or hear anything?

648
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,710
I think my memories are slowly returning.

649
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:54,270
I don't remember, but this place seems familiar, too.

650
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,150
My memories are like disconnected dots, so I can't connect them.

651
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,330
But they're returning.

652
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,730
I see. I'm glad.

653
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,230
- And Hyung. 
 - Pardon?

654
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,770
Why are you using honorifics all of a sudden?

655
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,370
I know. I just blurted it out suddenly, and you look more grown-up to me.

656
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,490
You said... your father passed away a long time ago. Right?

657
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,300
Yes. Why?

658
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,690
I remembered meeting your father.

659
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,720
What?

660
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,060
I don't know why I remember that. There's no way I'd have met someone who passed away.

661
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,800
What kind of memory was it?

662
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,370
- Many things... 
 - Many things, like what?

663
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:50,720
The bag you lost...

664
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,230
Your father's the one who gave it to me.

665
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:59,720
Wait! My father gave you the bag?

666
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,910
I have the memory, but it doesn't make sense.

667
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:08,150
You really remember my father giving you the bag?

668
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,500
Yes... telling me not to trust anyone.

669
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,070
 Don't trust anyone. Never go to the orphanage. 

670
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,280
 Hurry up and go. Quickly! 

671
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,480
It really doesn't make sense...

672
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,610
but I think that's the day I got hit by your car.

673
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,550
I guess it's true there's an error in my memories.

674
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,130
How could I have met someone who passed away?

675
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,960
Dong Joo Bookstore.

676
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,770
That's where I met him.

677
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,460
   
   

678
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,850
 The Seoul District Court held a hearing on the 

679
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,950
 collapse of Sampoong Department Store on June 29th. 

680
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,480
 The prosecution asked the defendants, Chairman Lee Joon and President Lee Han Sang of Sampoong ...

681
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,530
   

682
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,900
 Rock, paper, scissors! 

683
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,230
 Wait for me! 

684
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,390
 This is Dong Joo Bookstore. 

685
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,260
 One moment, please. 

686
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,900
 Dong Joo, don't go too far. Okay? 

687
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,070
 Hello? 

688
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,540
 Hello. 

689
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,150
 Is this Ha Neul? 

690
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,100
 You're Ha Neul, right? 

691
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,190
 Ha Neul... 

692
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,470
 Mister... 

693
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,580
 What's going on with you? 

694
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,970
 What's the matter? 

695
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,180
 Ha Neul, are you listening? 

696
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,740
 Ha Neul... 

697
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,550
 I don't know what's going on... 

698
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,210
 but everything will be okay. 

699
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,550
 It's all okay. 

700
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,080
 So don't worry and tell me about it. 

701
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,590
 No issue's impossible to solve in this world. 

702
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,480
 You can tell me about it. Okay? 

703
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,070
 It doesn't matter what the problem is. 

704
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,970
 I'll help you. 

705
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,170
 I'll help you. 

706
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,570
 Hey, don't you consider Kang San? 

707
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,970
 You'd do anything for your brother. Why did you cut off contact? 

708
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,850
 Mister... 

709
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,710
 Yes, yes. 

710
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,260
 Go ahead. 

711
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,090
 I have a request. 

712
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,290
 You're the only one I can trust. 

713
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,550
 The train is arriving. 

714
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,340
   

715
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,020
   

716
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,090
I met your father at Dong Joo Bookstore.

717
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,180
- That's where he gave me the bag. 
 - That's nonsense.

718
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,880
- I know it's nonsense— 
 - Why would my father be involved all of a sudden?

719
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,270
Why would my father have that bag?

720
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,770
That's why I'm asking you.

721
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,240
Why are you asking me? How would I know something you don't know?

722
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,150
Your father used to run Dong Joo Bookstore. Right?

723
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,100
Your name's the same as the bookstore's name.

724
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,710
Your family picture was taken at Dong Joo Bookstore.

725
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,350
That's not important right now!

726
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,790
Why is my father appearing at this point?

727
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,090
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

728
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,340
My father wasn't one of the characters.

729
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,140
If he was, there's no way I wouldn't know.

730
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,980
The bookstore...

731
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,890
What do you mean?

732
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,660
He was there.

733
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,610
- Lake Sopyeong? 
 - Yes.

734
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,470
Na Sang Woo's corpse is probably in Lake Sopyeong.

735
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,250
- And your reasoning? 
 - I'll find it for sure if you'll provide support.

736
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:09,080
Searching a lake isn't a simple job. You must have a reason for being so certain.

737
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,530
Is that what the novel said?

738
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,870
That he was thrown into the lake?

739
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,790
What are you talking about? A novel?

740
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,740
I was going to tell you later to avoid a misunderstanding—

741
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,610
Everything Detective Park said so far...

742
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,990
is all written in the novel.

743
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,710
The bookstore. It was there...

744
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,750
 Open the door! 

745
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,570
The bookstore, the b-bookstore. It was in there...

746
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,880
   

747
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,070
What are you doing?

748
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,430
   

749
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,950
But he doesn't mention my father after this.

750
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,330
The bag...

751
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,440
nor his younger brother going missing are mentioned.

752
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,720
 What are you doing? 

753
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,220
That's right.

754
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,700
He couldn't have written about them.

755
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:47,020
 The manuscript was already in the bag when Father gave the bag to Lee Kang San. 

756
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,010
 Even Kai doesn't know... 

757
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,520
 what happened after that. 

758
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,910
 He couldn't write about it. 

759
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,510
 The first act of the novel is the truth about the Lake Sopyeong incident 

760
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:06,240
 Lee Ha Neul witnessed and experienced. 

761
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,600
 The second act is Kai's plans for revenge. 

762
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,500
 My father's story goes in between the first and the second act. 

763
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,320
 The hidden story even Kai doesn't know. 

764
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:43,300


765
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,760
♫  Shout out loud  ♫

766
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,810
♫  On your two faces covered by darkness  ♫

767
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,540
♫  Venom  ♫

768
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,040
   

769
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,580
♫  Those hypocrisies  ♫

770
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,490
♫  Your dark face that hides the world  ♫

771
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,520
♫  Venom  ♫

772
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,550
   

773
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,180
 Where are we going? 

774
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,470
 It's not an error in your memories but an error in time. 

775
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,200
 Hey, hang on tight! Back to the future. 

776
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,640
 Coincidences don't exist in this world! 

777
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,460
 He's trying to tell us the truth that was buried 27 years ago. 

778
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,830
 If there's even an inch of possibility, it's our job to investigate! 

779
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,710
 Why do you think Jeon Doo Hyeon died? 

780
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,540
 You know better than anyone. 

781
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,640
 Money. 

782
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,150
 You're hiding something from me. Right? 

783
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,450
 I have a brother! 

784
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,750
 I must find Brother! 

785
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,780
 Raise your hands above your head slowly. 

786
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,120
 This isn't a novel. 

787
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,670
 Novels can't catch up to reality. 

788
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,550
 - I saw it.  
  - You witnessed it? 

789
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:43,010
 Why can't I see or hear anything from you, Hyung? 

790
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,780
 You wrote about what happened at Lake Sopyeong 27 years ago! 

791
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,600
 You said you'd understand regardless of what I say. Right?
