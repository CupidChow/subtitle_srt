1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,070
    
 How did you do that?

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,990
How did you know the grandma was going to pass away?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,220
Did she really tell you or something?

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,170
Where's the bag?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,920
My bag.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,680
Where is it?

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,660


8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,470
Your memories...

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,860
are back?

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,090
Do you have the bag, Hyung?

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,250
Oh, w-well, the thing is...

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,200
 You're Author Yook Dong Joo, right? 

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,270
You are, right? The one who wrote, "God Is Dead." Right?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,050
Nurse Kim!

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,860
Hurry up and come!

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,340
It's such an honor.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,470
Can we take a picture with you?

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,870
No, I'm sorry. I can't at the moment.

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,540
Let's go inside. L-Let's go inside and talk.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,760
Go in.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,690
You're an author?

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,830
Yes, well...

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,730
It's a complicated story.

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,210
First off, you're a patient who can faint from a shock.

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,740
Let's first have you calm down first.

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,450
It'll be better to talk with a composed mind.

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm composed.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,600
What?

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,890
Did you look inside the bag?

30
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,900
Hey, the thing is...

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,330
I'm sure everything I say will sound like an excuse.

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,920
Humans are endlessly powerless and fragile.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,720
In life, there come times when unexpected situations test you.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,180
I definitely didn't plan it or hold some kind of ill-intention.

35
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,260
But when a human is cornered, he sometimes makes absurd decisions.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,500
I know no words can justify my actions.

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,940
I'm a lunatic.

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm a nutcase. I was crazy back then. I totally lost it.

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,350
You dropped out of the sky, and they said you were dead.

40
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,420
And you came back to life like a miracle, only to be in a coma.

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,050
I was in a shithole and saw a lifeline coming down.

42
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,260
Though I knew it was a devil's temptation, I held it like I was bewitched.

43
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,440
- Hyung... 
 - I know.

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,450
It's all an excuse and a load of bullshit.

45
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,380
It's hard to comprehend, and you're right! It's hard to understand.

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,090
I understand you.

47
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,760
Everyone makes mistakes.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,080
Wait...

49
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,670
Are you thinking of it as a mistake?

50
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,880
I'm sure it was a mistake.

51
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,260
Do you mean that?

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,670
Yes.

53
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,050
It's not like you hit me with your car on purpose.

54
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,850
What?

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,740
It already happened, so don't apologize for it anymore.

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,880
Did you look inside the bag?

57
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,150
Wait! Wh-Why do you ask?

58
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,710
Did the bag have anything with my name, like a student ID?

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
No, I-I didn't see anything.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,710
Wait! Didn't you get your memories back?

61
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,830
I was being chased.

62
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,440
Ch-Chased?

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,100
By whom?

64
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,710
I don't know.

65
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,500
Wait...

66
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,770
Up to what point do you remember?

67
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,540
It was raining.

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,620
 I was being chased by someone. 

69
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,280
 And I had a backpack. 

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,750
I think there was something important in the bag.

71
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,700
What could that be?

72
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,900
I can't remember.

73
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,120
But you said it was something important.

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,570
Try to remember it.

75
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,260
I don't know.

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,200
I don't know why I was being chased and who was chasing me.

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,530
Who I am and what I had in the bag...

78
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,850
I can't remember anything.

79
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,880
Looking at the bag might jog my memory.

80
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,400
Is the bag at your place right now?

81
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,610
   

82
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,750
   

83
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,630
Gosh! Where did I put it?

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,280
Man, I think I did store it somewhere safe.

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,100
Come on, think about it!

86
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,270
I recently moved, so things are all over the place.

87
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,150
I couldn't even unpack my stuff.

88
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,190
- Let's go now and look for it together. 
 - Wait... you're a patient. You can't go.

89
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,150
- I'm not a patient. Let's go together. 
 - Hey!

90
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,110
I-I will find it myself.

91
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,250
I'm sure I'll find it if I unpack everything.

92
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,880
Y-You're a patient who's still in the hospital.

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,780
Wait! Wh-Where are you going?

94
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,280
- I'll ask if I can be discharged. 
 - Hey, you—

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,480
Wh-What's wrong?

96
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,520
   

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
   

98
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,490
 [Emergency Medical Center 

99
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,890
   

100
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,070
What's the matter?

101
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,500
Huh?

102
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,730
What's wrong?

103
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,000
Wh-Why?

104
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,900
Are you okay?

105
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,090
Whoa! Wh-Why?

106
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,530
Wait here. I'll go get the doctor.

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,730
Doctor! Doctor!

108
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,760
Hurry up and come!

109
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,290
Hurry—

110
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,630
Where did he go?

111
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,140
   

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,610
Doctor.

113
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,830
Don't come! D-Don't come any closer!

114
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,350
What are you?

115
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,620
What's your true identity?

116
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,220
How did you d-disappear like that?

117
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,920
How the hell did you do that— What's your identity?

118
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,820
I want to know that, too.

119
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,690
What?

120
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,980
I also want to know...

121
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,200
who I am and what happened.

122
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,360
   

123
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,750
Excuse me.

124
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,870
How badly did the inmate patient get hurt, and where?

125
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,650
He inflicted self-harm. His wrist and forehead.

126
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,410
They're not critical, though.

127
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,770
Is he trying to claim mental illness or something?

128
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,200
That's exactly the case.

129
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
He kept talking even during treatment... saying he was mentally unstable.

130
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,820
Take care.

131
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:41,570
   

132
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,530
I hear people writhing in pain.

133
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:51,740
Screams and cries... Most of the sounds are obscure and mixed up together.

134
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,890
But Grandma's voice was heard loud and clear.

135
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,600
Because she was asking so desperately.

136
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,750
You're saying that's how you knew the grandma was going to pass away?

137
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,680
Grandma's the one who told me.

138
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,980
That she was leaving soon.

139
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,360
I see strange scenes...

140
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,940
and that's when I feel terrible pain.

141
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,840
You're telling me to believe what you're saying?

142
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,470
How is that possible?

143
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,480
It's the truth.

144
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,190
Could you...

145
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,880
happen to have been a cultist?

146
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,420
Maybe traces of your occult remained in your body, despite having lost your memory.

147
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,930
- Never mind. 
 - Wait a second.

148
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,860
You're not lying, are you?

149
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,620
All right.

150
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,330
If what you're saying is true...

151
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:44,780
it means you've acquired a type of supernatural power such as telepathy after the car accident.

152
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,700
 Ouch! 

153
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,820
The lightning.

154
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,200
The lightning?

155
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,610
Hey, this is crazy.

156
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,720
What do you mean?

157
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,660
What about me?

158
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,870
What do you mean?

159
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,360
Do you see or hear stuff from me, too?

160
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,030
No.

161
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,810
Why doesn't it work on me?

162
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,250
- Who knows? 
 - I'm sure there's a rule.

163
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,840
Summarizing what you said...

164
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,700
you can telepathize with people who are experiencing great pain

165
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,240
or facing a problem they want to solve desperately.

166
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,310
That's what it feels like.

167
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,270
Do I lack the desperation or the pain?

168
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,080
- Who knows? 
 - There's no way. I lived a life of desperation and pain.

169
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,170
It doesn't seem like it applies to everyone.

170
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,930
Anyhow, you're saying it happens regardless of your intention. Right?

171
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,220
Yes.

172
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,880
Okay, fine.

173
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,650
Just try it out once.

174
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,690
Try what?

175
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,270
Try reading that person's desperation and pain.

176
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,900
You need to find a way to control it and experiment with it.

177
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,320
Hey, where are you going?

178
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,440
The world is a scary place. If you can't control it, who knows what could happen?

179
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,070
Your superpower can become a curse.

180
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,000
Also, never tell anyone about it.

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,640
They'll try to use you.

182
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,830
And can I trust you?

183
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,910
Are you... also going to use me?

184
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,610
The chance of me using you is 100%. Never mind, 200%.

185
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,240
Don't trust people, period. They're all shit.

186
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,940
- Is shit bad? 
 - It's not the shit. I'm figuratively using shit as a symbol to say people are evil.

187
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,660
- I suddenly want to use the bathroom— 
 - And that's called association.

188
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,100
Please bring my bag tomorrow.

189
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,140
Seeing you reminds me of my bag.

190
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,390
It's association.

191
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,100
 I hear people writhing in pain. 

192
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
 Screams and cries... 

193
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,180
 Most of the sounds are obscure and mixed up together. 

194
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,310
 But Grandma's voice was heard loud and clear. 

195
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,180
 Because she was asking so desperately. 

196
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,980
Ouch...

197
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,220
It's not a dream, huh?

198
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,780
The reality is more unrealistic than a novel.

199
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,420
   

200
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,740
I told you my best friend is a writer. Right?

201
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
It's his debut work.

202
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,390
Oh, the drunk-driving woman's son?

203
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,690
Gosh, forget about that now.

204
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,120
Anyhow, it's a total masterpiece.

205
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,870
It looks boring as hell.

206
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,090
Not at all. Reads like butter. The sentences are a work of art, too.

207
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,680
They're going to adapt it as a film.

208
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,640
I think I'll have to attend the premiere, too.

209
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,300
I'm sure he'll invite me for sure.

210
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,160
Really?

211
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,140
   

212
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,370
Hey, Writer Yook!

213
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,580
Man, speak of the devil. I was about to talk—

214
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,750
What? The bag?

215
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,710
 - What bag?  
 - Geez...

216
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,730
Hey, you know the bag you told me to throw out?

217
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,560
Yes, yes. The backpack.

218
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,090
Yes, the old bag. Did you throw it out by chance?

219
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,210
It's not here.

220
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,220
I already looked everywhere. It's not here.

221
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,680
Gosh, all right. Talk to you later.

222
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,850
Man, this is nuts.

223
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,250
Where did it go?

224
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,790
   

225
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,970
   
   

226
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,580
Did you stay here all night?

227
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,640
Go get some sleep while you can.

228
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,760
I'll go wash my face.

229
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,600
Team Leader Oh! About Director Shin Kyeong Cheol...

230
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,080
You got Director Shin's sexual assault video. Right?

231
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,660
Did Director Shin record it himself?

232
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,720
Or was it a hidden cam?

233
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,900
Team Leader Oh, please tell me something.

234
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
 Get away. I don't want to. What's your problem? 

235
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,810
 Come on, stay still. 

236
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,500
 Gosh, I don't want to. Let go. 

237
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,090
 I said stay still! You like it! 

238
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,270
 Get away from me, you lunatic! 

239
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,440
 Gosh, this fucking bitch is driving me nuts! 

240
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,370
 Do you want to die? Want me to kill you? 

241
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,460
Who leaked the info about the video?

242
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,550
Is it you, Detective Kim?

243
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,770
No, I saw this video just now for the first time.

244
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,220
We're inquiring about the victims of the incident, aren't we?

245
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,730
It must've leaked there.

246
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,770
It's a case overloaded with the best materials for writing gossip.

247
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,140
What does this mean?

248
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,110
It means the SNS investigators will move.

249
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,210
What does this mean?

250
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,440
Some outrageous things will happen if we don't solve the case quickly. Right?

251
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,870
Did you find Shin Kyeong Cheol's phone?

252
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,260
We're still searching, Team Leader Oh.

253
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,760
I think it'll be better to close in on the sexual assault victims and their acquaintances first.

254
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,500
The culprit must've left the evidence behind at the scene...

255
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,200
in order to expose Shin Kyeong Cheol's sexual assault.

256
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,990
Don't jump to conclusions. It might turn into secondary victimization.

257
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,710
We can't give up investigating just because of that.

258
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm saying we should be careful.

259
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,200
I have something to tell you.

260
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,210
This is Jeon Doo Hyeon, a murder victim from two years ago.

261
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,610
You were on that case when you were in Team 2.

262
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,310
The Mt. Ogeo murder case in Jeonnam.

263
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,690
Yes. It's still unsolved.

264
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,630
What about it?

265
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,520
There's a possibility the culprit of both cases might be the same person.

266
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,920
 Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder scene from two years ago looks almost identical to that of Shin Kyeong Cheol. 

267
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,160
 Also... 

268
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,850
this is the piece of wood that was found in Jeon Doo Hyeon's mouth.

269
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,900
 In both cases, the culprit left items that could be the victims' weakness at the scene. 

270
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:11,130
Gold ornaments were found inside the mouth of Jeon Doo Hyeon, who was a corrupt loan shark.

271
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,510
The USB with video footage of Shin Kyeong Cheol's sexual assault was found in his car.

272
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,420
And this piece of wood was found in both cases.

273
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,990
Kang Jae Soo...

274
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,010
weren't you in Team 2 as well?

275
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,790
Are you sure they're the same pieces?

276
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,830
We'd need the analysis from the NFS... but they look to be the same for sure.

277
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,610
What could this mean?

278
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,560
I don't know about that yet...

279
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,800
but the culprit's intention to expose the victims' twisted greed to the world seems clear—

280
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,830
Don't blow the meaning out of proportion.

281
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,960
It could be a copycat crime.

282
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,390
Is this what you mean?

283
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,580
That fucking psychopath is punishing people who committed crimes

284
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,850
himself as a means of exacting justice.

285
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,050
Something like that?

286
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,110
Closing in on the sexual assault victims and his acquaintances—

287
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,200
They have another thing in common.

288
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,140
What is it?

289
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,820
It's a picture from a monthly magazine article for the upper class issued ten years ago.

290
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,810
It was found in Jeon Doo Hyeon's pocket.

291
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,970
And?

292
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,020
In my opinion, I think the culprit left it intentionally.

293
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,940
For what?

294
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,530
I don't know the reason yet.

295
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,210
Is that Chairman Lee Tae Man of Taekang Group in the middle?

296
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,290
Yes.

297
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,320
They're high school alumni who kept a very close friendship.

298
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,290
 All right. Looking great. 

299
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm sure you all know about Lee Tae Man, the second chairman of Taekang Group.

300
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,240
He's often talked about in the media for alcohol and drugs.

301
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,120
Choi Jong Nam, the current district attorney of Seoul

302
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,180
has great power because his family produced judges and prosecutors for three generations.

303
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,820
He's a strong candidate for the next Attorney General.

304
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,930
I'll skip the explanations.

305
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,960
Finally...

306
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,940
he's an economics professor at Hankuk University.

307
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,260
And an only son of Kisan Atheneum, an academy conglomerate.

308
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,640
   

309
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,790
They gather periodically at a café called Fortuna, which only serves

310
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,060
upper class on a membership basis.

311
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,150
 Whoa! 

312
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,030
 Die. 

313
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,750
 Three died so far. 

314
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,130
 Your turn's up now! 

315
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,370
 Whoa... 

316
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,690
It's called the Nobles' Meeting among the upper class.

317
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,860
Also, Fortuna's CEO, Kang Hye Kyeong, has known them since high school.

318
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,880
She's an illegitimate child of DF Construction's Chairman, Kang Dae Shik.

319
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,010
 Gosh! 

320
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,430
 Man... 

321
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,680
 - Geez! 
 - Yes! 

322
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,170
So what?

323
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,620
What does this have to do with Shin Kyeong Cheol's death?

324
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,650
   

325
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,380
Besides Na Sang Woo here...

326
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,730
they were the last people Shin Kyeong Cheol had met before he was murdered.

327
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,330
So you're saying...

328
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,490
the people in the picture from Jeon Doo Hyeon's pocket, who was murdered two years ago,

329
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,250
are those whom Shin Kyeong Cheol met for the last time before disappearing?

330
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,260
Yes.

331
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,710
The two murder scenes and evidence are also similar.

332
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,200
There are too many overlaps for it to be a coincidence.

333
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,590
Wait a minute.

334
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,860
Isn't Professor Na Sang Woo missing right now?

335
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,240
It's been about seven years. Right?

336
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,750
Yes.

337
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,420
Though I'm not sure, there might be three victims.

338
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,320
   

339
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,290
   

340
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,180
Gosh, that scared me.

341
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,740
   

342
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,860
   

343
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,160
Congrats.

344
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,490
It's the number one bestseller, both online and offline.

345
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,310
Yeah.

346
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,560
"Yeah?"

347
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,450
Is that all?

348
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,760
That's great.

349
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,630
 Man, you're really impossible. 

350
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,480
Shouldn't you at least show me some expression of gratitude?

351
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,480
Am I supposed to be grateful to you?

352
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,660
Hey, bestsellers are made by marketing.

353
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,350
In any case, we're having a celebratory party in the evening at work.

354
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,660
Hey, I'll call you back.

355
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,450
Hello—

356
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,060
Gosh, has he gone mad now that I've elevated him?

357
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,580
He dared to hang up on a call from me?

358
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,090
Wait! Is something wrong?

359
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,250
 Oh, he's here. 

360
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,170
That man is the witness. Okay?

361
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,620
This guy is the witness. He saw everything.

362
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,840
Are you his guardian?

363
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Wait! What's going on?

364
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,140
This man called the police, saying this young man assaulted him.

365
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,090
Assaulted him?

366
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,400
You saw it all, too. Right?

367
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
My ribs over here got fractured. How will you compensate me?

368
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,000
- Excuse me. 
 - Go on and answer me!

369
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,690
Tell me which country allows an innocent citizen to be assaulted in the hospital.

370
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,120
I'm going to sue both you and the hospital. Okay?

371
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,700
Get me the hospital director.

372
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,940
- Director! 
 - Calm down, please.

373
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,730
For a young brat to be assaulting people already,

374
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,970
it's obvious what he'll become!

375
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,110
Did you witness him getting assaulted?

376
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,280
N-No.

377
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,590
Mister...

378
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,190
They're on the same side, so there's no point in asking.

379
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,330
Please just stay still!

380
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,460
You're saying you didn't see anything. Right?

381
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,500
He's a car accident patient. How can he assault someone when he's as weak as a leaf?

382
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,070
This guy was throwing himself around against the wall and stuff.

383
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm telling you that brat must've done something.

384
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:47,190
He glared at me, and my body was thrown into the air, crashing into the wall!

385
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,750
Man, this is ridiculous.

386
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,310
Mister, are you an expert blackmailer or something?

387
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,940
Move aside.

388
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,760
Hey, you fucking demon.

389
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,590
Go on and do it again.

390
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,540
Do whatever the heck you did before again!

391
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,650
He's a patient!

392
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,410
Take this man away from here.

393
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,650
Get out!

394
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,800
Please leave.

395
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,910
What the heck is this? What the hell?

396
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,440
- Wh-What— 
 - You're going to catch a cold.

397
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,330
That guy is d-doing all sorts of things.

398
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,750
I-Is he Michael Jackson?

399
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,070
You saw. Right?

400
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,320
You saw?

401
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,860
- Brother! 
 - Yes.

402
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,320
You came just in time.

403
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,720
That fucker was, just now—

404
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Get yourself together, for goodness sake!

405
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,290
You made Mom suffer her entire life...

406
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,420
Must you add to it even on the day of her funeral?

407
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,980
You clearly saw it, too!

408
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,790
Cut your bullshit.

409
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,950
Are you still drunk?

410
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,630
Hey!

411
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,480
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,010
That young man didn't do anything.

413
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,480
Have you gone mad?

414
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,160
I apologize.

415
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,750
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,250
- I'm sorry. 
 - Please leave.

417
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,600
Why the hell would I leave?

418
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,340
If you keep this up, I'll arrest you...

419
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,340
for false accusation and obstruction of public duty!

420
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,540
Wait, I'm not lying. I clearly saw it with my own eyes!

421
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,920
 Geez, seriously! 

422
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,500
By the way...

423
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:29,820
thank you so much for helping my mom...

424
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,030
pass away in peace.

425
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,430
What do you want?

426
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,490
What was that?

427
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,310
Your eyes.

428
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:07,360
They turned blue just now... and pushed that guy away.

429
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
How did you do that?

430
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,920
Did you bring my bag?

431
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,720
What do you mean, disappeared?

432
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,340
It's like I said.

433
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,770
It disappeared.

434
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,270
You mean you lost it?

435
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,590
I didn't lose it. It disappeared.

436
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,620
Look carefully again.

437
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,850
You said you were being chased. Right?

438
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,100
Yes.

439
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,060
You don't remember anything else?

440
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't.

441
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,320
Do you happen to—

442
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,780
Never mind.

443
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,500
What is it?

444
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,240
- This is what you call a dilemma. 
 - What?

445
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,800
I can't awaken the memories of the beholder of truth.

446
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,540
But I can't find out the truth without awakening their memories.

447
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,350
Stop with this nonsense. Did you check what was inside the bag?

448
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,160
There was nothing special.

449
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,210
Writing instruments like pens and pencils, and a rock...

450
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,250
Why would I carry a rock?

451
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,850
That's what I want to know.

452
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,530
And?

453
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,320
An old-fashioned cassette player.

454
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,380
- A Mymy? 
 - Oh, yes! A Mymy.

455
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,350
How do you still listen to music using that? It's hard to find nowadays.

456
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,030
Were you trying for a retro vibe?

457
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,540
Then, how do you listen to music?

458
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,860
Through an app.

459
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,660
- What's that? 
 - An app is an app. What do you mean?

460
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,340
Is it like a recording device?

461
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,600
You even forgot things like that, too?

462
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,360
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

463
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,330
I feel anxious... and have a bad feeling.

464
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,380
Why? Is someone calling out to you again?

465
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,400
I can feel them.

466
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,580
Whoa! Is it okay to leave him alone?

467
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,770
What if something happens?

468
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,030
Yes, Editor!

469
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,560
I just got here.

470
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Okay!

471
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,610
Geez...

472
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,940
   

473
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,030
 I'm fine, I'm fine. 

474
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,620
Director Shin had especially a lot to drink that day.

475
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,180
As you probably know, Director Shin had a hard time

476
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,240
because of that scandalous incident at the time.

477
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,410
Even after Chairman Lee Tae Man and General Manager Choi had left, he stayed alone to drink.

478
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,090
 I'm off. 

479
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,750
 I'm leaving! 

480
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:39,430
 - Let's go!  
  - I never imagined... that would be the last time I'd see him.

481
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,600
Director Shin was a long-time friend.

482
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,360
We shared a lot together and have many memories.

483
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,650
All the more shock I feel.

484
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,540
Yes, of course.

485
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,290
If Shin Kyeong Cheol was drunk, you probably called a designated driver. Right?

486
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,450
The same company I always call. I'll give you their number before you leave.

487
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,790
Okay.

488
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,160
By chance, do you happen to know what this might be?

489
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,320
   

490
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,800
It looks like a piece of wood.

491
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,550
You have no idea what it could be?

492
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,590
No.

493
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,690
You're aware Na Sang Woo is reported missing. Right?

494
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,770
Of course, I do. He's my best friend.

495
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,040
Out of your four best friends, one is missing and one was murdered.

496
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
You don't find that strange?

497
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,720
It's unfortunate rather than strange.

498
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,790
You have no idea what might be happening?

499
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,060
Aren't you two the ones who are investigating?

500
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,960
Goodness, I apologize. There was a bug.

501
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,770
Any napkins?

502
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,250
The bugs keep appearing even with strict pest control.

503
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,750
They have incredible survival instincts.

504
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,560
Was there really a bug?

505
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,930
Bugs can be found anywhere.

506
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,770
Thank you, Senior.

507
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,780
All of a sudden?

508
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,670
Team Leader said that you offered to partner with me first.

509
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,510
Oh, that?

510
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,590
I know everyone else rejected me.

511
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,080
Says who?

512
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,860
And I was doing paperwork in the back,

513
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:10,010
so I'm grateful to retire after running on the field.

514
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:14,540
You better prepare yourself. I'm the crazy bitch in this area.

515
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,490
I got it, so you should go home and get some sleep. You need to sleep to work.

516
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,610
I'll think about it.

517
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,600
   

518
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,270
   

519
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,420
   

520
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,410
   

521
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,630
   

522
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,790
   

523
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,040
You asked for me?

524
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,030
Look into Author Yook Dong Joo.

525
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,630
And... look for someone with tight lips and a dexterous hand.

526
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,150
I have a covert job for him.

527
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
   

528
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,850
Its popularity is skyrocketing right now. They're sold out at all the bookstores.

529
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,640
Really?

530
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
Yes, really. Do you have trust issues?

531
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,580
Wow, Dong Joo really made it big.

532
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,900
This is just the start.

533
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,720
All this time, I was a bit upset with you all, to be honest.

534
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,940
Why in the world?

535
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,080
I know you all badmouthed my Dong Joo for having his head in the clouds

536
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,260
and making deliveries instead of getting a real job.

537
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,640
Gosh, don't make such accusations. Who badmouthed him?

538
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,960
It's all right. That's understandable. It's all in the past now.

539
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,460
Don't misunderstand.

540
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,750
I said it's all right.

541
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,160
I didn't say anything because it seemed like I'd be bragging, but I knew my son would succeed as a writer.

542
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,370
He was exceptional since he was young.

543
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,710
Even on his first birthday, he picked a pencil out of everything else.

544
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,600
- Oh, my. 
 - Even in grade school, he read so many books, I had to hide all of them!

545
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,660
So he could play with his friends outside.

546
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,730
He was exceptional from the start!

547
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,500
He takes after his dad. My husband used to read a lot of books.

548
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,780
And he was very well-rounded.

549
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,230
- He didn't have a single flaw. 
 - Gosh.

550
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,590
How nice would it be if he was still alive... He would've been proud of Dong Joo's success.

551
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,620
Gosh...

552
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,760
Dong Joo must make tons of money now.

553
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,240
Fame over money. Money naturally follows.

554
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,470
You should treat us! This is worth a neighborhood celebration.

555
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,020
Of course, I should treat you!

556
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,780
What do you want? Lay it on me. I'll buy you everything!

557
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,790
Soju?

558
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,230
Soju, soju!

559
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,470
Let's go for a drink.

560
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,100
I knew you'd succeed, but I didn't know it would climb up so fast.

561
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,570
It's a big hit.

562
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,110
It's all thanks to you, Editor.

563
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,160
It's all thanks to your generous vision, CEO Lee.

564
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,590
Most importantly, the writing is remarkable.

565
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,860
There's something I want to ask you, Writer Yook.

566
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,890
Yes.

567
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,610
Regarding your novel.

568
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,280
You started out with short sentences while omitting rhetoric as much as possible.

569
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,350
And you pushed on with symbolic metaphors and a dry writing style.

570
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:35,230
- Yes? 
 - But... toward the end, you utilized a long-winded writing style.

571
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:40,830
The writing style completely changed as if... someone else took over.

572
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,120
Is there a reason you chose to do that?

573
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,420
Human beings are like that.

574
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,590
People are different in the morning and at night, and yesterday and today.

575
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,020
The duality and ambivalence of humans.

576
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,290
Wasn't your intention to stir an unfamiliar feeling?

577
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,390
Th-That's... right.

578
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,200
To stir unfamiliarity.

579
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,520
It was conceptualized by the Russian writer and formalist Viktor Siklovsky.

580
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,210
People feel aesthetic value from new and unfamiliar things

581
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,590
rather than everyday and familiar things that they encounter daily.

582
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:22,790
I just made myself... unfamiliar to them.

583
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,940
Such a deep meaning.

584
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,780
Yes... right.

585
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,130
You need to learn the basics again.

586
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,370
What are you saying?

587
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:52,240
Hey, if I turned you into a bestselling author, isn't it etiquette to at least act joyful if you can't thank me?

588
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,500
Your expression has been dark, and you don't even properly greet the staff.

589
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,620
I'm not in the best condition today...

590
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,990
You're no longer a deliveryman Yook Dong Joo. Is that it?

591
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,200
That's harsh.

592
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,190
Have some dignity befitting the title of writer.

593
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,780
It's hard when you don't have any, to begin with, but all the more reason to try harder.

594
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,550
Are you being jealous?

595
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,480
- What? 
 - Forget it. I should get going.

596
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,230
Pardon me.

597
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,660
I think you should come out for a moment.

598
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,810
Mom!

599
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,370
Oh, Dong Joo!

600
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,450
- Why did you come here? 
 - I'm right on time.

601
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,760
I said, why did you come?

602
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,630
I came to take a tour.

603
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,670
Hello.

604
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,750
Oh, my. Oh, my, oh, my! Hello!

605
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,730
I saw you on TV!

606
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,080
You said to visit the company at any time. Hand-in-hand with family.

607
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,550
Yes. This space is open at any time.

608
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,360
They're my neighborhood friends.

609
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,790
They were curious about what a publishing company looks like,

610
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,110
but they're all busy during the day.

611
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,210
"Let's just have dinner if they're closed,"

612
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,370
- is what we planned to do. 
 - That's right.

613
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:17,720
But Writer Yook happened to be here.

614
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,190
You did the right thing.

615
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,060
We were having a simple company dinner to celebrate the publication.

616
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,210
We can't impose on your company gathering.

617
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,990
We got a good look, so we'll go now.

618
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,220
No, it's okay.

619
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,370
We should eat first.

620
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,020
Should we?

621
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,000
- Come here for a second. 
 - Oh, sure.

622
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,110
You can start eating!

623
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,050
It's a company dinner to celebrate my son's novel!

624
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,230
What the heck are you doing?

625
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,410
Why, why, why?

626
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,840
"Why, why, why"?

627
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,160
What were you thinking just barging in like this?

628
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,720
I told you! He said we're welcome to visit anytime—

629
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,010
Didn't you think about my position?

630
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,060
How could you always only think about yourself?

631
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,730
I was just curious about what the company looks like.

632
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,710
And I agreed to treat my friends,

633
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,780
so we were just going to look and get some pork—

634
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,610
You think this is an amusement park?

635
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,450
That's not what I meant!

636
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,770
How can you be so thoughtless?

637
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:25,200
Imagine how much Lee Myeong Seok, that bastard will ridicule me. And the staff, too.

638
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,720
Take your friends and leave. Buy them dinner with this.

639
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,100
Are you embarrassed of me?

640
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,980
Did I say that?

641
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,350
I'm sorry I'm ignorant and lack refinement.

642
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,730
That's not what I'm saying.

643
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:47,440
I just wanted to show off.

644
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,420
It felt like I was being compensated for all the belittling I received.

645
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,250
I acted immaturely because I was so excited and happy.

646
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,130
I'm sorry I humiliated you.

647
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,640
I'll take my friends and go.

648
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,300
Mom, Mom, Mom!

649
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,810
What?

650
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,780
My reputation has already been shit-stained.

651
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,790
Eat before you leave.

652
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,080
Should I?

653
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,710
Don't overreact.

654
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,410
I won't.

655
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,880
By the way, how could a writer use such vulgar language?

656
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,100
How could you say, "shit-stained?"

657
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,560
Use more refined language.

658
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
Be more cultured.

659
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,890
What's with your hat?

660
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,690
What about the inmate?

661
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,970
I couldn't hold it in. Hurry up and go.

662
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,890
No...

663
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,130
No!

664
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,720
Stop!

665
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,900
 Dad. 

666
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,940
- Dad. 
 - Yes?

667
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,950
Over there.

668
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Mister, you shouldn't do that there. There are children here.

669
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,240
I ought to kill that son of a bitch.

670
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,220
He must've been in a hurry.

671
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,760
Still.

672
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,390
Let's go. Let's go.

673
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,950
- Dad. 
 - Yes?

674
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,220
Over there.

675
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,860
 Today at 4:00 p.m., an unprovoked murder occurred in the parking lot 

676
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,870
 of a large shopping mall in the middle of Seoul. 

677
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:54,830
 The father died on the spot after being brutally stabbed by a man in his 40s... 

678
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,340
W-What is this?

679
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,250
What's inside my head?

680
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,120
Stop it!

681
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,380
Please stop it!

682
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,760
Please save me. I'm sorry.

683
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,380
Please save me!

684
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,840
Hey, what's wrong?

685
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,910
- Please! 
 - What's wrong with you?

686
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,870
P-Please save me.

687
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,390
I came in because of the ruckus.

688
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,070
- I'll get his attending physician. 
 - Okay.

689
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,180
Please save me! I'm sorry!

690
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,790
I'm sorry! P-Please save me!

691
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,750
I'm-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

692
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,990
Please save me!

693
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,380
How did you do that?

694
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,210
I could feel it. My memories and my pain...

695
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,810
were transferred to him in its entirety.

696
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,980
I'm not sure how I did it, either.

697
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,900
If I didn't at least do that...

698
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,340
it felt like I would end up killing him.

699
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,050
And I thought it would be better...

700
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,730
if he could live a tormented life instead of just dying.

701
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:53,730
Are you saying... that was possible with just a thought?

702
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,860
Yes.

703
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:03,910
It was true about what you said about seeing and hearing strange things.

704
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,200
I must've become a monster.

705
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,170
You're not a monster just because you're different from others.

706
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:22,380
Just like what the majority says isn't necessarily the answer.

707
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,630
I'm scared...

708
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,430
I might end up hurting someone.

709
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,450
   

710
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,320
There must be a reason.

711
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,910
We can't medically explain it, but there's definitely a special reason...

712
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,070
why all this is happening to you.

713
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,570
Do you think I can find that reason?

714
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,300
I'm not sure...

715
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:03,170
I think we've already found the reason.

716
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,960
I'm not sure if this will answer your question, but to me...

717
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:21,140
you're my savior... not a monster.

00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,120
Yes, she got home safely.

723
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,410
- Yeah. 
 - I see.

724
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:24,110
Your mother is quite simple.

725

Yes, she's very humane.

726
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,720
And honest.

727
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,240
It seems like she's still working.

728
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,710
She highly values the worth of labor.

729
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,830
And she's quite the independent woman.

730
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,790
What's your mother's highest education level?

731

Tell her not to barge in like that next time.

732
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,550
It's a bit awkward for you in front of the staff, too.

733
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,870
And she comes off as uncultured.

734

What, what, what?

741
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,140
- No! 
 - What's wrong with him?

744
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,140
Writer Yook!

745
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,190
Yes?

746
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,370
 Yook Dong Joo. 

747
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,780
Who's this?

748
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,850
 You've done something very dangerous. 

749
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,940
What do you mean by that?

750
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,820
 This novel wasn't meant to be revealed to the world. 

751
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,720
 The edits you made were all right. 

752
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,600
Although the sentences were a bit lengthy, you made rather smooth edits.

753
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,300
 However, the ending wasn't what I wanted. 

754
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,920
 You're wrong. 

755
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,450
The ending must be different when it's time for the trial.

756
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,130
The ending must go according to my plan.

757
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,050
Let's meet.

758
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:53,930
Let's meet and talk.

759
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,070
 We'll meet at least once when the time is right. 

760
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:00,640
Actually, let's just meet and talk. I'll go where you are.

761
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,180
Good luck.

 Was there an actual case you used as a motif for your novel? 

774
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,850
 The request to find the truth through an investigation... 

775
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,670
 I was the police in charge at the time of your accident. 

776
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,540
 Is there a problem with Detective Park? 

777
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,000
 Pain, devastation, plea... is that what you felt? 

778
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,920
   
 What's your reason for sending me this book? 

779
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,550
 Be open about the possibility of one culprit for both cases and having to start all over. 

780
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,120
 What if there's an accomplice? 

781
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,550
 It's definitely related to that incident. 

782
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,690
 - Incident? 
 - The incident from 27 years ago. 

783
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:28,670
 Are you sure he's dead? 

784
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,480
 Is the entire story in this novel your creative work? 

785
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,960
 Answer me if you can hear me! 

786
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,500
 Hyung is here! 

787
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,600
