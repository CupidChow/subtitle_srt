1
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:05,147
Die!

2
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:07,967
- Kang San, no! 
 - Die!

3
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,427
 Kang San. 

4
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,017
 Kang San! 

5
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:43,817
 You can't, Kang San. 

6
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,980


7
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:27,787
Father, please have mercy upon us!

8
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,767
Father, please have mercy!

9
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:41,407
 A star fell from the sky. 

10
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:45,637
   

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,920
 I like you. 

12
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:05,247
 Dong Joo! Yook Dong Joo! 

13
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,717
 Dong Joo. 

14
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,977
 We were worried because you suddenly disappeared. 

15
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,187
 We looked everywhere for you. 

16
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:24,347
 Your dad must be worried. Let's get going. 

17
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,797
 Here. 

18
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:29,467
 - It's a rock. 
 - It's a star. 

19
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:30,707
 A star? 

20
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:35,657
 A star fell from the sky last night. 

21
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,907
 This is the star. 

22
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,297
 Really? 

23
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,827
 I saw it. 

24
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:46,377
 You can have it, Hyung. 

25
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,287
 You found it. Why are you giving it to me? 

26
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:53,207
 It fell from the sky, so I should return it to Ha Neul. 
 (Ha Neul means sky in Korean.) 

27
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:57,097
 - Huh? 
 - You're Ha Neul. 

28
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,097
 Thanks. 

29
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:07,137
 Are you tired? 

30
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,907
 You want a piggyback ride? 

31
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,697
 Huh? 

32
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,707
 What Dong Joo said could be true. 

33
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,707
 I heard you can see the Pi Puppids meteor shower between the 15th and the 28th. 

34
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:34,327
 - Really? 
 - Yeah. 

35
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,897
 Our earth science teacher told us in class. 

36
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:43,087
 Dong Joo could've mistaken a meteor for a falling star. 

37
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,677
 And this could be that meteorite. 

38
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:49,927
 - Is it a lucky charm? 
 - It might be. 

39
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:53,497
 They say if you make a wish while looking at a meteor, it'll come true. 

40
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,137
 Do you think Dong Joo made a wish? 

41
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,117
 Let's ask him when he wakes up. 

42
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:00,957
 Okay. 

43
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,187
Writer Yook.

44
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:26,027
   

45
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:29,017
Are you awake?

46
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,747
You're in the hospital.

47
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:45,857
Just lie down.

48
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,417
What about Kang San?

49
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:54,627
He disappeared.

50
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,547
Kang San's phone is turned off.

51
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,527
Will you be okay?

52
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,107
I'm fine.

53
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:15,257
Wait. How long was I unconscious?

54
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:18,757
It's been three hours since you arrived at the ER.

55
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,437
What in the world happened?

56
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:26,477
What were you and Kang San doing there?

57
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:33,817
Someone came looking for Kang San at the office.

58
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:38,157
That's him.

59
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,887
I met him at my signing event.

60
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:44,037
- He was at the signing event, too? 
 - Yeah.

61
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:47,887
He had a Cheonyoung Church cross tattoo on his hand.

62
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:51,557
What exactly did this man say to Kang San?

63
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:55,627
He just spoke gibberish like he was crazy.

64
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:57,767
Tell us what you heard.

65
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:03,747
He kneeled in front of Kang San and asked him to forgive his sins.

66
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:08,477
 I thought Ahn Hyeon Mook was god. 

67
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:10,517
 I thought... 

68
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,997
 I was doing God's work. 

69
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:28,567
 Tell me... more in detail. 

70
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:38,417
That's when Kang San suddenly disappeared into thin air.

71
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,117
I can't believe it even though I saw it with my own eyes.

72
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,897
Believing that would be strange.

73
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,257
Did you get his contact number?

74
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:50,787
I was totally out of it after Kang San suddenly disappeared.

75
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:52,567
He left before I could.

76
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,527
He didn't tell you his name, either?

77
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:55,927
Yeah.

78
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,987
Oh, right!

79
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:09,157
That man gave this to Kang San.

80
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,977
This is the other one Kang San wore when he came here.

81
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:34,797
That's the other one Kang San left in the past.

82
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:38,077
- What? 
 - How did that man have this?

83
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:42,347
Kang San said he was being chased by someone when he leaped through time.

84
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,037
Are you saying he was the man chasing Kang San that day?

85
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:46,517
That's right.

86
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,447
He probably witnessed Kang San disappear before his eyes.

87
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:53,077
Since then, he probably believed Kang San was God.

88
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:57,187
I don't get what you're saying, but he did seem like he viewed Kang San as a god.

89
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,337
He probably did.

90
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:03,077
This man also knows about my father's death.

91
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,277
What do you mean?

92
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,977
He said sorry to me at the signing event.

93
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:11,567
I didn't understand what he meant then, but I think he was talking about my father.

94
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,997
Oh! That man was bare-handed!

95
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,687
His fingerprints should be on the sneaker.

96
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,537
I'll call you as soon as we find out his identity.

97
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:27,067
Okay.

98
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,007
Please call me when Kang San returns.

99
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,687
I will.

100
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:36,797
And... when Kang San resided at Cheonyoung Orphanage,

101
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:40,207
he was heavily assaulted by Ahn Hyeon Mook.

102
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,677
Assaulted?

103
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:45,247
He said he was assaulted in someplace called the Repentance Room.

104
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:48,107
As well as the other children.

105
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:54,077
He said some children never returned after being dragged to the Repentance Room.

106
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,647
They were never seen after being dragged away?

107
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:58,027
Yes.

108
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:04,677
I don't even want to think about it, but I think something terrible happened there.

109
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:10,597
What's more terrible is the same thing might still be taking place.

110
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,507
   

111
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,547
   

112
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:53,347
- Hello? 
  - Kang San is with me. 

113
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:56,607
Is Kang San all right? Is he hurt anywhere?

114
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,397
 Hello? 

115
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:07,327
He briefly came to and fell back asleep.

116
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,177
 That's a relief. 

117
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:11,377
What happened?

118
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,377
Let's meet up and talk. I'll go over there.

119
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:17,427
You can't. I only called in case you were worried.

120
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:21,077
I won't tell anyone. I promise you.

121
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:25,087
- I'll send him back once he's awake. 
 - Wait!

122
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,477
It's not too late.

123
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,727
Take Kang San and leave.

124
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:34,397
Leave with Kang San before the detectives find you.

125
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:38,577
Kang San needs his brother. He wants to be with you.

126
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:40,577
I'll help you.

127
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,887
Ha Neul...

128
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,487
- Hyung! 
 - I'll hang up.

129
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:50,917
Kang San is in danger!

130
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:56,497
- What do you mean? 
 - Kang San's pulse has become a lot weaker.

131
00:10:56,497 --> 00:11:00,067
He passed out twice in the past few days.

132
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,167
- Did he go to the hospital? 
 - Kang San is a special kid.

133
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,257
It's not something the hospital can treat.

134
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:09,377
The doctor also thinks it's a psychological problem.

135
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,617
It looks like a change is taking place in Kang San's body.

136
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:16,057
What Kang San needs right now

137
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,227
is you, Hyung.

138
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:22,177
Hyung.

139
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:27,647
Hyung! Ha Neul.

140
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:50,887
I checked out the vehicle information Lee Ha Neul sent you.

141
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,817
It's stolen, as expected.

142
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,157
Is he on the wanted list?

143
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:55,767
On the day of Byeon Jong Il's death,

144
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,197
he was caught on CCTV on the road near his house.

145
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:02,117
Everyone's eyeballs are about to pop out while reviewing the CCTVs,

146
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,977
- but it's taking some time. 
 - We have to catch him before he flees.

147
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:09,800
We'll have to catch him before then to put Lee Tae Man in cuffs.

148
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:13,757
- How about a wiretap? 
 - He planted it inside Byeon Jong Il's shoes.

149
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,257
I feel perplexed.

150
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,947
About what?

151
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,177
It feels like we're co-investigating with Lee Ha Neul.

152
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:27,567
He's a murder suspect, but it's like we're partners.

153
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,307
Team Leader Oh!

154
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:34,897
We found the vehicle of Byeon Jong Il's murder suspect.

155
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,547
Did you find anything?

156
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:52,277
It's clean. He probably wiped all fingerprints from the car, too.

157
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:54,687
There should be something, whether it's saliva or hair.

158
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:57,007
He must've made a call from inside the car.

159
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,967
We just need one drop of saliva.

160
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,627
All right.

161
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:04,147
Was there anything in the car?

162
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,517
- No. 
 - Call forensics.

163
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,357
Okay.

164
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:12,587
But...

165
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:29,167
The owner of this car discarded those gloves in the trash?

166
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,657
- Yes. 
  - Then why are you wearing them? 

167
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:35,787
- They're in good condition. 
  - Take them off immediately! 

168
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,957
You two are in perfect sync.

169
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:45,697
Request an urgent DNA analysis right away. Tell them to rush.

170
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,967
How severe is his dementia?

171
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,427
- It's stage 5. 
 - What does stage 5 mean?

172
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:55,447
He's inarticulate in his speech, but he can recognize people.

173
00:13:55,447 --> 00:14:00,707
He's able to speak well at times, but I'm not sure how he's doing today.

174
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,637
I see.

175
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,497
It's that gentleman.

176
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,027
Hello.

177
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:15,077
I'm Lee Byeong Man.

178
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:21,367
I came to ask you about your son.

179
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,247
Who are you?

180
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,237
I'm the police.

181
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,587
Have you found my Chang Geun?

182
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:36,027
Did your son go somewhere?

183
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:42,147
My son... is dead.

184
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,297
Then...

185
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:51,967
who's the son you have now?

186
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:56,407
He's my son.

187
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:00,717
I thought he was dead.

188
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,707
Says who?

189
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:07,717
- You just said— 
 - Did Ha Neul come with you?

190
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:14,037
My son is very kind.

191
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,277
He's a good kid.

192
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:24,127
Do you remember this?

193
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,557
Little Dong Joo gave it to you.

194
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:31,757
You considered it your lucky charm and carried it around in your bag.

195
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,697
I did.

196
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,927
It's not an ordinary rock.

197
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:42,187
Little Dong Joo was right.

198
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:45,287
- That it's a meteorite? 
 - Yeah.

199
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:49,377
This meteorite saved my life that night.

200
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:53,767
And it brought me to Dong Joo.

201
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:58,917
I can...

202
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,247
just feel it.

203
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,277
Kang San.

204
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:13,957
Did you really... try to kill Ahn Hyeon Mook?

205
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:18,957
If it weren't for Dong Joo,

206
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,607
I would've killed him.

207
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,897
I'll get going.

208
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,197
Kang San.

209
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,757
Yeah?

210
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,387
Do you want to live with me?

211
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,127
Really?

212
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:57,397
Yeah, if it's okay with you.

213
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:59,917
Of course, it's okay.

214
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,107
It'll be uncomfortable and tough.

215
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:05,137
- It's okay. 
 - You might not be able to attend school, either.

216
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:08,367
It's okay. It's all okay, Brother.

217
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:14,697
You won't get to see Dong Joo for a long time, either.

218
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,057
We'll meet again eventually.

219
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,747
When are we leaving?

220
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,657
The sooner, the better.

221
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:31,107
A few days is enough.

222
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,977
All right.

223
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:37,247
I heard online credit loans are difficult.

224
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:39,347
Yes.

225
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:41,657
I'm a freelancer.

226
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:44,397
A house collateral?

227
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:47,517
I see.

228
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:52,087
I'll call you back. Thank you.

229
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:18,227
I found my way to the right place!

230
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:22,297
- What are you doing here, Mom? 
 - I came to see my son.

231
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:24,657
This must be the kitchen.

232
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:28,377
Did you have lunch yet?

233
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,367
- Not yet. 
 - That's good.

234
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:33,777
I made your favorite geotjeori and rice. 
  (Unfermented kimchi) 

235
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:36,207
You shouldn't have gone through the trouble.

236
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,717
What's so hard about this?

237
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:42,917
I also made braised beef ribs and marinated abalone.

238
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,357
You need to eat well when you're having a hard time.

239
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,087
Eating is winning.

240
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:50,897
Oh, I almost forgot.

241
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,127
Here.

242
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,397
- What is this? 
 - Money.

243
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,417
- Mom! 
 - You gave me a large sum last time.

244
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,637
I didn't even touch it because it was so precious.

245
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:13,387
I was going to wire it to you, but I don't know your account number.

246
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:20,217
Looking back, I only ever received from you, so I never even asked for your account number.

247
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,697
I withdrew it as a check.

248
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:28,887
It's your allowance money. You can give me more once you earn money again.

249
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,337
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,667
Why are you sorry?

251
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:44,487
I don't need money or anything as long as you're healthy.

252
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:49,667
Cheer up, Dong Joo. Okay?

253
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:52,577
Okay?

254
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:59,097
Boss!

255
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,507
The watch I left earlier—

256
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,197
Why?

257
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:20,527
   

258
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:22,070
What?

259
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,420
We want to expand the youth support project,

260
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:39,757
of a foundation to help victims of school violence.

261
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:44,747
We'll select excelling students from middle and high schools across the country

262
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:47,057
and provide opportunities to study abroad,

263
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,687
and we'll also give scholarships to students in need.

264
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:59,787
And hosting a camp to build character with experts from all walks of life will also help improve the group's image.

265
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:02,377
Since when did you plan this?

266
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:09,277
It's as if you knew I'd step down as chairman and prepared for it.

267
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:15,907
Gosh... From team leaders to executives, we had a meeting all night.

268
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:20,867
The result of the overnight meeting is just like you.

269
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,247
It's too textbook style. Right?

270
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:29,127
No, it's so obvious and hypocritical.

271
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,617
That's upsetting to hear.

272
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:39,107
I'm just trying my best to fill in for you until you get back.

273
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,487
Honestly, I have no interest in managing the group at all.

274
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,767
That novel...

275
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:52,067
You said you decided to publish it. Right?

276
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,747
Don't get the wrong idea.

277
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:58,557
It was my decision, but I had no idea this would happen.

278
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:02,557
- If I had known, why would I— 
 - Your mom was like that, too.

279
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:08,377
She said she wouldn't ask for anything if you were added to the family register.

280
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:17,537
And then, she gradually took over the art gallery, department store, and everything else.

281
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:23,127
As expected of a former ace hostess, she stole Father's soul.

282
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:27,587
You have no interest in managing the group?

283
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:31,947
Cut the crap and just enjoy it.

284
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:34,927
It won't last long, but I'll turn a blind eye.

285
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:38,817
Brother,

286
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:42,317
I truly don't have an ulterior motive.

287
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:45,757
There's no human without self-interest.

288
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:51,677
The world... runs on self-interest.

289
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:55,697
Just enjoy what you can.

290
00:23:55,697 --> 00:24:00,577
Since I'm the one who decides whether you live or die.

291
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:03,917
In here,

292
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:08,597
I'm the law.

293
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:11,377
You don't need to give me a ride. The bus is quick!

294
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:15,697
There's someplace I need to visit nearby after dropping you off.

295
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:19,507
- Don't make up excuses. 
 - I'm serious.

296
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:25,847
- I meant to visit sooner, but I couldn't. 
 - Where is it?

297
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:14,927
Let's talk!

298
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:20,187
Wait! Hold on!

299
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,807
Please tell me.

300
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:43,597
Who killed...

301
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:47,137
my father?

302
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:57,617
Byeon Jong Il... killed your father.

303
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:03,267
How did he pass away?

304
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:22,597
I'm sorry.

305
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,067
Shit!

306
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,937
I lived in penance.

307
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:47,837
Since then, I've been wandering around the country looking for the hardest jobs intentionally.

308
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:53,377
Every day, I worked my body into the ground,

309
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,807
ate just enough to stay alive,

310
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:00,767
and there wasn't a day I slept in peace.

311
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,847
I wanted to repent, even if it meant...

312
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:07,277
overworking myself.

313
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:14,687
By doing that, I believed God would eventually forgive me.

314
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:19,117
Forgiveness is something you seek from people, not God!

315
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:27,417
You have to apologize and ask for forgiveness to those you've caused pain, not to God!

316
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:30,637
I'm sorry.

317
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:35,147
Those children... where are they?

318
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:40,047
The children who disappeared from Cheonyoung Orphanage.

319
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:42,927
You know where they are. Right?

320
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:51,037
If you truly want to repent and be forgiven, tell me the truth now.

321
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:54,327
Find those children and reveal the truth to the world,

322
00:27:54,327 --> 00:28:00,937
and ask for their forgiveness, not God's.

323
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,227
I got the identity of the man who brought the sneaker.

324
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,547
His address is uncertain, but—

325
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,940
   

326
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,867
Are you Detective Park Hyeon Soo?

327
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,527
Joo Han Jong?

328
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:43,257
Yes.

329
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,477
Writer Yook didn't come with you?

330
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:57,167
He confessed everything.

331
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,487
   
 (Is a 2016 anti-corruption law in South Korea.) 

332
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:04,137
He gave a detailed account of everything that happened on the day of your father's death.

333
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:06,357
But...

334
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:09,287
 since the main culprit, Byeon Jong Il, died, 

335
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:13,777
 the case will close without the right to indict. 

336
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:31,047
Where have you been all this time?

337
00:29:32,807 --> 00:29:35,937
- When did you come? 
 - It's been a while.

338
00:29:35,937 --> 00:29:38,277
Where are you coming from?

339
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,317
I sent the cult leader Ahn Hyeon Mook to hell.

340
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,817
What do you mean?

341
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:47,407
The cross tattoo guy who came to you turned himself in.

342
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:50,057
- Turned himself in? 
 - Yes.

343
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:52,287
Gosh, I'm so tired.

344
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:54,387
Goodness... Oh my goodness!

345
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:59,127
My body is aching everywhere all over because of you-know-who.

346
00:29:59,127 --> 00:30:00,847
You look totally fine.

347
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:04,537
I only look fine outside, but I have pain in my joints.

348
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,517
I'm sorry.

349
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,367
You're sorry. Right?

350
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:12,947
Yes.

351
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:16,657
You do the packing for the move, then.

352
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:18,607
We're moving?

353
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:19,967
Yes.

354
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,787
When?

355
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,157
- By the end of this month. 
 - That's so soon though.

356
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,517
But we still have a few days.

357
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,627
Where are we going?

358
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,457
I'm looking right now.

359
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:33,157
You still haven't decided?

360
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:36,097
There are plenty of studios and rooftops.

361
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:42,067
We'll have to get closer by living in one room, so it'll be nice. Right?

362
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:46,817
You don't need to worry about me.

363
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:50,397
I'll take care of everything, so don't worry about a single thing.

364
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:53,127
- No, that's not it— 
  - Dong Joo! 

365
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:59,907
- When did you come? 
 - A while back.

366
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:04,127
Hey, did you really come from the—

367
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:05,997
What's the matter?

368
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,137
Oh, right.

369
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:14,157
Hey, you said Lee Myeong Seok gave you this watch. Right?

370
00:31:14,157 --> 00:31:15,687
Yes.

371
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:19,877
Whoa, Lee Myeong Seok. That piece of trash!

372
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,857
Why? Is it fake?

373
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:24,797
That's not it.

374
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:28,957
He had installed a bug in the watch.

375
00:31:28,957 --> 00:31:30,357
What?

376
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:35,677
Lee Myeong Seok knew in advance you were going to expose the Lake Sopyeong incident.

377
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:38,357
What the hell?

378
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:42,387
So he intentionally did nothing to screw over his brother?

379
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,647
- Basically, yes. 
 - Wow!

380
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:47,137
Lee Myeong Seok, that bastard, was the true villain.

381
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:49,047
What if he's listening in right now, too?

382
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:51,827
I already took care of it.

383
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,297
If you do this,

384
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:56,567
the signals get blocked completely.

385
00:31:56,567 --> 00:32:00,117
But how did you know there was a bug in it?

386
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:03,877
I was going to sell it, so I gave it to someone who owns a shop.

387
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:05,917
W-Why sell it?

388
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,967
Well, the thing is...

389
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,987
you would need some money.

390
00:32:11,987 --> 00:32:14,577
I don't need luxury watches like this.

391
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:18,597
I also don't like it because Lee Myeong Seok gave it to me.

392
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:22,417
Should we sue him for illegal wiretapping?

393
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:25,097
Is the bugging device still there?

394
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:28,287
I left it there for now, just in case.

395
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:41,007
Why?

396
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:45,220
There's a bugging device in this?

397
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,757
Hey, what are you doing?

398
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,747
Lee Myeong Seok!

399
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,247
 Are you listening? 

400
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:54,847
Can you hear me, Lee Myeong Seok?

401
00:32:57,777 --> 00:33:00,177
You're really something else.

402
00:33:00,177 --> 00:33:05,077
You clearly knew what would happen to your brother but kept silent.

403
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:07,807
And made a big contribution to exposing the truth.

404
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:09,337
You have my compliments.

405
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:13,270
But what happens when your brother finds out about this?

406
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:18,177
I'm a veteran exposer and your brother is a professional killer.

407
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:21,197
- You're in for trouble, huh? 
 - Hey, Yook Dong—

408
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:22,867
 Myeong Seok. 

409
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,280
Be careful walking around at night.

410
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:28,547
Your brother is really scary.

411
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:37,567
Are you really going to tell Lee Tae Man?

412
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:38,787
Nope.

413
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:40,367
You just scared him?

414
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:43,797
Anxiety eats away at one's soul.

415
00:33:49,547 --> 00:33:51,287
   

416
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:59,917
Gosh, shit.

417
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,617
 Just enjoy what you can. 

418
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:08,747
 Since I'm the one who decides whether you live or die. 

419
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:38,857
Hi, it's Lee Myeong Seok.

420
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:43,437
I'd like to see you right now about an important matter.

421
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,447
Hyung.

422
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,177
What?

423
00:34:55,617 --> 00:35:00,247
During the move, you don't need to worry about me.

424
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:05,897
I told you not to worry.

425
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:10,017
Ha Neul said to live together.

426
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,057
What?

427
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:16,777
Ha Neul and I are going to go away.

428
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:18,517
Really?

429
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:26,667
That's great news. Where are you going?

430
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,547
Did you decide on a place?

431
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:32,737
I think Brother has an idea.

432
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:34,987
I see.

433
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:36,967
When are you leaving?

434
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,917
He said it'll take only a few days.

435
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:42,157
That quickly?

436
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:44,097
Yes.

437
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:47,907
Well, yeah. Sooner, the better.

438
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:49,797
Good for you.

439
00:35:50,427 --> 00:35:53,257
What are you going to tell Detective Park?

440
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:56,617
If I disappear suddenly, she'll get suspicious.

441
00:35:59,317 --> 00:36:01,517
I'll just say you went back to the past.

442
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:05,467
- Will she believe you? 
 - She already saw you teleport.

443
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:09,147
Even if I say you went back, she won't even be fazed.

444
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,067
Is that so?

445
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:14,367
The boy from the past goes back to the past.

446
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,247
It's perfect.

447
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:20,217
Will you...

448
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:23,127
- be okay on your own, Hyung? 
 - Of course.

449
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:26,027
I always preferred to be alone.

450
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:30,907
It's hard to focus or write when someone else is there.

451
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:36,447
But... a few days is a bit too soon.

452
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:45,327
Let's do something meaningful in those few days.

453
00:36:46,617 --> 00:36:48,727
What kind of meaningful things?

454
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,817
Something like packing for the move, maybe?

455
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,077
You're dead set on ordering me around to the end.

456
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,557
You're younger than me and stronger.

457
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:57,667
Let's have dinner.

458
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:18,497
 The murder case that took place at Lake Sopyeong. 

459
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:20,697
 To whom should I speak? 

460
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,527
 My name is Jeon Chang Geun. 

461
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:29,527
Senior!

462
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:35,167
We got the search warrant for Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple.

463
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:40,787
I also looked into Jeon Chang Geun.

464
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:47,217
He had run away from home in seventh grade and never went back to school.

465
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:53,397
He came back home after four years and passed middle school and high school GEDs that year,

466
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,787
getting accepted to college the following year.

467
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:59,357
As the top scorer of the department, on top of that.

468
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:03,207
And he even got a scholarship for all four years.

469
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:06,347
A student who had the lowest grades before running away from home

470
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:09,977
appeared after four years and achieved all that.

471
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,757
Aren't you getting the idea?

472
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:20,497
It's possible for Lee Ha Neul, Tae Kang High School's valedictorian.

473
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,427
What if...

474
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:27,327
I had listened genuinely and...

475
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:36,057
did my best to help Lee Ha Neul on the day he came to the police station,

476
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:41,527
how would Lee Ha Neul be living now?

477
00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:48,597
That doesn't mean everyone in his shoes becomes a murderer.

478
00:38:49,957 --> 00:38:53,897
Checking if Jeon Chang Geun is Lee Ha Neul is simple.

479
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:58,787
It'll become certain if we compare his DNA to Lee Kang San's.

480
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:01,257
Are you telling me to compare them?

481
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,757
Of course, a detective should do so.

482
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:07,857
Ahn Hyeon Mook!

483
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:12,587
You're under arrest for child abuse, assault, and murder.

484
00:40:12,587 --> 00:40:13,647
What nonsense!

485
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:17,257
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

486
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:21,027
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

487
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:24,707
The lord will punish you!

488
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:27,107
 Leader of Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple Ahn Hyeon Mook 

489
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:30,807
 was arrested for child abuse, assault, and murder. 

490
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:33,477
 Dispatched upon an insider's report, 

491
00:40:33,477 --> 00:40:36,287
 the police found skeletal remains of children 

492
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:40,657
 at a mountainside property of Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple. 

493
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:42,427
 According to police investigations, 

494
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:46,657
 Ahn used domestic and foreign donations given to 

495
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:49,007
 Cheonyoung Orphanage, 

496
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:51,637
 owned by Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple for decades. 

497
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:54,147
 He also regularly abused, assaulted, 

498
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:59,607
 and locked up young children for edification purposes. 

499
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:05,027
 The police requested an in-depth analysis of the remains to find out 

500
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:07,917
 the causes and times of death of the victims. 

501
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:12,537
 They're also still excavating the site, in case there are 

502
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:18,390
 still more remains buried underground. 

503
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:22,707
♫  Imma tell you I can't stop now  ♫

504
00:41:22,707 --> 00:41:26,037
♫  Nothing holds me back now  ♫

505
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:29,107

♫  Baby, don't close your eyes  ♫

514
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:55,317
Will you continue to exercise your right to remain silent?

515
00:41:55,317 --> 00:42:00,097
 On the other hand, the believers claim that the arrest of Ahn is religious oppression. 

516
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:04,837
 And they announced a large-scale protest this weekend. 

517
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:13,817
 You can go away now. 

518
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:15,997
 To where? 

519
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:20,077
 Anywhere, as long as I'm not there. 

520
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:25,197
 Everywhere I breathe, you're there. 

521
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:28,607
 I can't promise you anything. 

522
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,727
 It's okay. 

523
00:42:32,037 --> 00:42:34,397
 Don't wait. 

524
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,567
 I'll wait. 

525
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:45,447
♫  Imma tell you I can't stop now  ♫

526
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:48,737
♫  Nothing holds me back now  ♫

527
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,887
♫  Because you belong to me  ♫

528
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:55,227
♫  One day you will know, know, know  ♫

529
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:57,627
♫  I can't let you go  ♫

530
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:01,957
The name's Hwang Soo Cheol, 35 years old, with five assault convictions.

531
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:03,857
He hasn't left the country yet.

532
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:05,417
Team 1, go to his residence.

533
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,897
Team 3, go to his girlfriend's studio.

534
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:10,667
Let's get him in a jiffy and go for some pork belly with soju.

535
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:46,167
Detective Park, are you okay?

536
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,497
I'm okay.

537
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:54,247
I think he was arrested last night right before going to the airport.

538
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:55,557
And?

539
00:43:55,557 --> 00:43:58,277
He'll never mention your name.

540
00:43:58,277 --> 00:44:02,337
But you should leave the country for now for your safety.

541
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:04,387
Why should I?

542
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,507
It's too late to just cover it up now.

543
00:44:10,507 --> 00:44:17,057
What's fortunate is your name's the only one in his call history.

544
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:23,717
In my opinion, I think it's time for one person's sacrifice.

545
00:44:26,737 --> 00:44:29,797
Instigated murder doesn't get you that many years.

546
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:33,037
It'll be even shorter with a top lawyer.

547
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:38,507
If you take a trip, I'll make sure to reward you well.

548
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:43,887
Shouldn't you try being an executive of a subsidiary, Secretary Kim?

549
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:56,797
I'll just do... as you say, Chairman.

550
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:59,107
Of course.

551
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,187
I knew I've got good eyes for people.

552
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:09,297
These gloves are yours, right, Hwang Soo Cheol?

553
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:14,387
- They're not. 
 - Your DNA was found inside the gloves.

554
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:18,657
And the dead Byeon Jong Il's DNA was found outside the gloves.

555
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:21,437
Who ordered you to kill Byeon Jong Il?

556
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:24,007
Is it Chairman Lee Tae Man?

557
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:27,687
We got your call history with Chairman Lee's secretary.

558
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:31,717
Will you be the fall guy for Lee Tae Man?

559
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:37,017
Lee Tae Man ordered you to kill. Right?

560
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:41,607
Get me a lawyer, please.

561
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,407
I'm sorry.

562
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:11,797
I'm sorry.

563
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:39,767
Where are you?

564
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:52,377
Woo Jeong!

565
00:46:59,447 --> 00:47:01,757
What happened?

566
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:06,817
I suddenly... got confused with the streets.

567
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,747
This never happened before.

568
00:47:11,587 --> 00:47:13,627
I'm really sorry.

569
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:20,377
This is... near the café.

570
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:23,027
I know.

571
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,967
Well, I'm okay now.

572
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,177
It's this way. Right?

573
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,817
Yes.

574
00:47:38,457 --> 00:47:41,807
It's called pre-senile dementia.

575
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:47,367
I got brain trauma a few years ago from a car accident.

576
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:51,547
That must've been the cause.

577
00:47:56,437 --> 00:48:00,757
Something like today was a first, so I was flustered, too.

578
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:09,347
But I'm telling you because I think you should also know about it now.

579
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,667
You don't need to worry too much.

580
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:17,297
If I take my meds, I can slow down the process.

581
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:26,557
By any chance, if something like today happens again, I'll call you right away.

582
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:38,687
I... won't be able to come for a while.

583
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:40,427
Why?

584
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:47,657
I'm going away with Ha Neul.

585
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:52,987
I didn't know you were ill.

586
00:48:54,537 --> 00:48:57,407
I want to be by your side.

587
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:04,967
But my brother... doesn't have anyone else but me.

588
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:12,427
I'm sorry... Woo Jeong.

589
00:49:14,507 --> 00:49:18,307
Why would you apologize for something like that?

590
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:22,587
It's not like we'll never meet again.

591
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:27,147
When are you leaving?

592
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,347
Tomorrow.

593
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:34,417
So soon?

594
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:40,527
We won't meet for a while, but I'll contact you frequently.

595
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:42,817
And send you emails, too.

596
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:50,077
I'll also... come see you for sure.

597
00:49:50,077 --> 00:49:55,537
♫  I just sit down and call out for you  ♫

598
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:58,177
You need to come while I remember you.

599
00:49:58,177 --> 00:50:03,137
♫  Every moment feels like a dream to me  ♫

600
00:50:03,137 --> 00:50:09,717
When you come back, it won't be good if I can't remember you.

601
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:14,527
♫  The fact that I can never call you again  ♫

602
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:17,367
♫  Get hurt only for a bit  ♫

603
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:20,687
♫  Let's endure for a bit  ♫

604
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:24,967
♫  Hurting all of my days  ♫

605
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:53,947
Are you going somewhere?

606
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:57,587
What's the matter?

607
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:06,797
I went to see your father two days ago.

608
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:13,957
I'm looking for someone and I wanted to confirm if he's the person.

609
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:20,657
So, did you get confirm it?

610
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:22,217
Yes.

611
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:37,637
He wasn't the person.

612
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:45,427
You weren't the person I was looking for, Jeon Chang Geun.

613
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:51,217
People used to say I had the keenest senses.

614
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:55,537
But maybe it's my old age. I've become dull.

615
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:05,767
If I met... the student from 27 years ago again,

616
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:09,407
there was something I wanted to tell him.

617
00:52:17,777 --> 00:52:19,757
I'm sorry.

618
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,817
I've always been sorry.

619
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:32,327
I'll be sorry... for the rest of my life.

620
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:40,387
I'm sorry for bothering you, too, Jeon Chang Geun.

621
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,227
Thank you for your time.

622
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:51,137
Please be in peace and live a happy life.

623
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:24,487
Tomorrow?

624
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:26,077
Yes.

625
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,297
How fortunate.

626
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:35,427
I was going to say you should leave as soon as possible.

627
00:53:35,427 --> 00:53:38,997
- Why? 
 - Detective Park said today—

628
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:44,487
Never mind. You're leaving tomorrow anyway, so forget it.

629
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,777
- What is it? 
 - Don't try to know all the adults' stuff.

630
00:53:47,777 --> 00:53:51,337
- I'm older than you, Hyung. 
 - Your talking nonsense.

631
00:53:51,337 --> 00:53:55,027
Shouldn't we do a special event or something?

632
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:57,787
- It's our last night together. 
 - Look how excited you are.

633
00:53:57,787 --> 00:54:01,077
First off, let's go somewhere with lots of people.

634
00:54:01,077 --> 00:54:04,257
Let's have you bump into people,

635
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:07,117
see and hear their pain, and use your superpower.

636
00:54:07,117 --> 00:54:09,927
Yes, that's great. Nice.

637
00:54:11,897 --> 00:54:14,067
I'm kidding.

638
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:19,247
I'm a little upset that I can't see your strange power anymore.

639
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,997
I don't see them anymore.

640
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:24,577
What?

641
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:30,947
Even if I bump into people, I don't see or hear anything anymore.

642
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:32,687
What do you mean by that?

643
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:37,087
I don't have any superpowers anymore.

644
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:39,837
They vanished.

645
00:54:39,837 --> 00:54:41,317
Are you sure?

646
00:54:41,317 --> 00:54:45,047
I used to see and hear from touching a handle on the bus before.

647
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:47,327
But I don't even feel anything.

648
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:49,417
Since when?

649
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:55,667
I think it disappeared after the day I tried to kill Ahn Hyeon Mook.

650
00:54:58,697 --> 00:55:01,107
I think what you said is true.

651
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:04,257
What did I say?

652
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:10,017
It's a power to be used for saving people in pain and for good deeds.

653
00:55:11,037 --> 00:55:16,767
But... I tried to kill someone.

654
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:20,057
Congrats.

655
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:25,077
Congrats on being able to bump into people freely now.

656
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:28,007
As they say, being ordinary is a great thing.

657
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:29,887
Yes!

658
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:34,567
♫  A messy dawn  ♫

659
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:39,747
♫  Under the black moon, insignificant  ♫

660
00:55:39,747 --> 00:55:42,997
♫  When it twirls, when it twirls  ♫

661
00:55:42,997 --> 00:55:47,120
♫  Chaos in the darkness  ♫

662
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,417
♫  You're a liar from the beginning  ♫

663
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:54,737
♫  Cause you said  ♫

664
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:59,137
♫  With emotionless eyes  ♫

665
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:03,277
♫  Sooty wound  ♫

666
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:07,577
♫  Oh, you're a liar from the beginning  ♫

667
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:11,567
♫  Cause you're saying  ♫

668
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:16,267
♫  An angry expression on your bitten lips  ♫

669
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:23,967
♫  Bent our history and mystery  ♫

670
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,997
 I didn't wake you up on purpose. 

671
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:46,507
 Since we're not parting forever, I'll skip the goodbyes. 

672
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:50,957
 Thank you for everything, Hyung. 

673
00:56:50,957 --> 00:56:55,527
 Right. Don't be too happy I'm gone. 

674
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,617
 I'll appear any time. 

675
00:56:57,617 --> 00:57:05,367
♫  Get out of this swirling place  ♫

676
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:13,867
♫  Look at the real you in your frozen smile  ♫

677
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:29,527
 Did you take care of... Professor Na Sang Woo's corpse, Secretary Kim? 

678
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:34,697
 It clearly happened inside Brother's office. 

679
00:57:34,697 --> 00:57:42,457
 That means you're the only one who would've taken care of the corpse. 

680
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:45,567
 No, I didn't. 

681
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:51,647
 Instigating the murders and death of Na Sang Woo. 

682
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:55,227
 Do you plan to take them all on? 

683
00:57:57,437 --> 00:58:00,037
 Can't you decipher the situation? 

684
00:58:00,037 --> 00:58:03,057
 Brother can't get back up again. 

685
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:13,997
 Should I... propose an offer for you? 

686
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:21,187
I only followed Chairman Lee Tae Man's order.

687
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:25,297
So you're saying Chairman Lee Tae Man murdered Professor Na and

688
00:58:25,297 --> 00:58:29,347
you got rid of the body with Hwang Soo Cheol,

689
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:33,057
who killed Byeon Jong Il, Kim Joon Ho?

690
00:58:33,057 --> 00:58:36,157
I only helped move the dead body.

691
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:39,187
The one who buried the body is Hwang Soo Cheol.

692
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:41,997
Where did he bury the body?

693
00:58:53,857 --> 00:58:56,067
 Kang San will be waiting. 

694
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:58,447
 - You go there for me, please.  
 - I can't!

695
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:00,747
You're the one Kang San is waiting for.

696
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,847
Please go back to Kang San!

697
00:59:02,847 --> 00:59:04,617
 Please go for me. 

698
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:06,657
Why are you doing this?

699
00:59:06,657 --> 00:59:08,997
 Because I want to live. 

700
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:17,837
 I want to live... shamelessly with Kang San. 

701
00:59:34,797 --> 00:59:37,327
Lee Tae Man!

702
00:59:47,457 --> 00:59:49,327
    
 Lee Tae Man,

703
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:52,927
you're under emergency arrest for murdering Na Sang Woo.

704
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:58,867
- What's the meaning of this? 
 - We found Na Sang Woo's corpse and

705
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:01,667
a piece of a liquor bottle was buried with it.

706
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:06,197
And on it, your fingerprints are very clear.

707
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,707
- Take him. 
  - Yes! 

708
01:00:18,807 --> 01:00:25,360
   

709
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:37,430
   

710
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:48,100
   

711
01:00:57,507 --> 01:01:00,927
Gosh, I told him to be here.

712
01:01:04,987 --> 01:01:06,947
Choi Jong Nam.

713
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:09,327
What do you want?

714
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:11,607
   

715
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:16,457
You're under emergency arrest for murdering the victim of Lake Sopyeong homeless man murder incident, Joo Jin Seong.

716
01:01:16,457 --> 01:01:17,477
What did you say?

717
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:21,017
I'm sure you know the Miranda Rights, but give him the notice.

718
01:01:21,017 --> 01:01:22,307
Yes.

719
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,247
You have the right to an attorney—

720
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,237
Are you kidding me?

721
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:28,847
The statute of limitations expired ages ago.

722
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:34,437
You know the statute of limitations pauses as long as you're abroad and resume. Right?

723
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:38,477
You had two years of working abroad experience, so I had my hopes up.

724
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:40,957
But it lacked just the amount of time you spent in Hawaii.

725
01:01:40,957 --> 01:01:42,947
What kind of bullshit is this?

726
01:01:42,947 --> 01:01:45,847
You can't even do simple math.

727
01:01:45,847 --> 01:01:48,837
How did you become an inspector general?

728
01:01:48,837 --> 01:01:52,817
- You're making a mistake. 
 - Your friendship is quite deep.

729
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:58,437
Lee Tae Man got caught at the departing terminal, and you get caught at the arriving terminal.

730
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,767
- Cuff him. 
 - Yes.

731
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:32,020
   

732
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,967
 Circumstantial evidence on Tae Kang Group's lobbying to politicians, 

733
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:37,217
 the prosecution, the press, and even the Blue House 

734
01:02:37,217 --> 01:02:41,787
 were spotted, ranging in amounts from a hundred millions of won to billions of won. 

735
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:45,117
 All of them were done at the order of Lee Tae Man, who was the chairman. 

736
01:02:45,117 --> 01:02:50,197
 Choi Jong Nam, who was an inspector general, was also found to be involved in the bribery. 

737
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:55,640
 The police told of a strict joint investigation with the prosecution. 

738
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,420
   

739
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:06,777
♫  The whispering fleeting away from me  ♫

740
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:09,947
♫  I listen to that sound  ♫

741
01:03:09,947 --> 01:03:11,737
 Kang San! 

742
01:03:11,737 --> 01:03:19,370
♫  I want to hear what it is that you want  ♫

743
01:03:21,107 --> 01:03:27,067
♫  Two trembling hands, anxious eyes  ♫

744
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:29,807
Kang San.

745
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,747
Where's my brother?

746
01:03:31,747 --> 01:03:39,570
♫  Going forward one step at a time at the sound of my heart  ♫

747
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:44,407
♫  I keep fighting, still fighting  ♫

748
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:54,167
    
 ♫  The fate ahead of me can never stop  ♫

749
01:03:56,857 --> 01:04:01,527
   

750
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:06,847
   

751
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:14,327
♫  Take away the great sorrow bothering me as well  ♫

752
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:19,620
♫  No one can stop me  ♫

753
01:04:20,617 --> 01:04:24,637
♫  I keep fighting, still fighting  ♫

754
01:04:26,717 --> 01:04:29,827
How's your college life? Is it fun?

755
01:04:29,827 --> 01:04:32,337
Well, you know how it is.

756
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:36,517
But I think kids these days are a little cold.

757
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:38,907
Aren't you one of those kids?

758
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:43,997
I try to look like one of the kids these days, but it's hard to get used to.

759
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:47,237
Brother, I started jogging.

760
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:49,567
We used to jog every day.

761
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:51,597
- Really? 
 - Yes.

762
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:54,577
When I wake up early in the morning, I jog for one hour, no matter what.

763
01:04:54,577 --> 01:04:58,097
Like back then, it feels really refreshing.

764
01:04:59,117 --> 01:05:02,847
Once you get out of prison, let's jog together again.

765
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:05,837
You have only three years left now.

766
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:08,597
Okay. Let's do that.

767
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:12,097
Are you okay, Brother? Are you not sick?

768
01:05:12,097 --> 01:05:13,437
Of course.

769
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:16,857
Oh! I heard Dong Joo's book came out.

770
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:19,627
Yes, it's totally our story.

771
01:05:19,627 --> 01:05:23,947
He said he'll give me 30% of the royalties once he gets paid.

772
01:05:23,947 --> 01:05:26,477
Though I don't know if it'll sell.

773
01:05:28,087 --> 01:05:30,287
Congratulations, Writer Yook.

774
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:32,837
I already handed out your book to my team.

775
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:35,217
 My, thank you. 

776
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:38,557
But where are you right now? It's a little noisy.

777
01:05:38,557 --> 01:05:41,597
 I'm getting ready for a YouTube interview about the book. 

778
01:05:41,597 --> 01:05:43,377
Oh, I'll hang up then.

779
01:05:43,377 --> 01:05:46,947
Also, I'll pay you a visit this weekend.

780
01:05:47,637 --> 01:05:49,297
Okay.

781
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,410
   

782
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,677
Do you believe in miracles?

783
01:06:04,747 --> 01:06:07,277
Do I believe in miracles?

784
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,867
Of course, I do.

785
01:06:10,827 --> 01:06:18,557
I think everything in our daily lives that we take for granted is a miracle.

786
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:22,977
Breathing, eating,

787
01:06:22,977 --> 01:06:27,317
running, walking, laughing, and chatting.

788
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:34,767
I think miracles are happening to us, even at this very moment.

789
01:07:43,157 --> 01:07:45,217
What are you doing?

790
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:48,617
You're here?

791
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:51,357
Gosh, I'm hungry.

792
01:07:51,357 --> 01:07:54,227
- What's for dinner? 
 - Ramen.

793
01:07:54,227 --> 01:07:58,057
- You didn't make rice? 
 - Am I your cook?

794
01:08:00,107 --> 01:08:02,317
You don't even pay rent, so you should cook at least.

795
01:08:02,317 --> 01:08:06,127
You said 30% of the royalties will do it.

796
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:08,217
I want to have kimchi stew, though.

797
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:11,507
Kimchi stew is something I can make.

798
01:08:12,347 --> 01:08:15,967
- I'll cook the rice. 
 - Of course.

799
01:08:20,557 --> 01:08:22,657
It came back.

800
01:08:24,057 --> 01:08:25,990
What?

801
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:31,980
