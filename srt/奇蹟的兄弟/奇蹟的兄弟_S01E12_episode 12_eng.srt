1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:03,437
Brother wrote that novel.

2
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:09,237
I know how he's come to write that novel.

3
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:16,167
Brother, tell her the truth.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:28,880


5
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:33,427
Gosh...

6
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:38,467
You said your father left you his diary.

7
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:41,657
You said you wrote your novel based on that.

8
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:47,247
Is that true?

9
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,667
It...

10
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,237
I-It's similar.

11
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:54,267
What do you mean it's similar?

12
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:57,697
It's not exactly in a diary format.

13
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:04,067
W-Well, I guess you could say it is a diary. Anyway, there was a record of it.

14
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,657
Can I see that record?

15
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:09,887
He lost it while moving.

16
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:13,857
How do you think your father knew about it?

17
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:18,157
- Pardon? 
 - It's not like your father was at the crime scene.

18
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,297
How do you think he knew all that?

19
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:22,667
- Well, as for thatâ€” 
 - Kang San.

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,087
I'll tell her.

21
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:33,077
That was missing in the record, so...

22
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:35,397
I don't know exactly.

23
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:42,147
But I think Lee Ha Neul... probably asked my father for help.

24
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:48,567
At the time, the only adult Lee Ha Neul could trust was my father.

25
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:55,647
And I'm sure Lee Ha Neul left a videotape with my father.

26
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:58,437
If you say a videotape...

27
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:04,517
Are you talking about a tape recording of the murder scene from 27 years ago?

28
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:06,357
That's right.

29
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:11,407
I know I gave that to someone.

30
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,337
Who was it again?

31
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,477
Gosh, this is so annoying.

32
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:20,557
Is my head full of udon noodles? Why can't I remember?

33
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,157
Enough already. Put some side dishes aside.

34
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:24,607
It's almost lunchtime.

35
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,607
It's because I feel like I could almost remember it.

36
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:29,147
Why are you seeking so desperately for that stupid toy?

37
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:32,497
It's not just a stupid toy. Dong Joo's dad made it himself!

38
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:35,477
Anyone who saw it begged us to give it to them. Calling it a work of art.

39
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:38,357
If it was that amazing, why didn't you keep it well instead of throwing it away?

40
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:40,737
I didn't throw it away. I had no choice but to give it away to someone

41
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:43,387
when we shut down the bookstore and moved out hurriedly.

42
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:46,217
When I think back to that time, I still get teary-eyed.

43
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:48,837
I didn't have a room to move to, so I had my parents take Dong Joo,

44
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,887
and I went around looking for a room to rent.

45
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,617
It must've been your neighbor, then.

46
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:56,347
- My neighbor? 
 - You said you gave it away when you moved.

47
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,317
That's right. It must've been a neighbor.

48
00:02:58,317 --> 00:02:59,457
A neighbor who?

49
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,297
Whoever it was, I'm sure they threw it away by now.

50
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,777
Why would they still have it?

51
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,877
A neighbor...

52
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:12,687
Then, the existence of a tape is uncertain.

53
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,477
I'm sure it exists.

54
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,747
How can you be so sure?

55
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,207
Because it was in exchange for my father's life.

56
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,197
What do you mean by that?

57
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,377
The night that Kang San came to me...

58
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:36,087
crossing over space and time,

59
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:41,907
Father...

60
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,127
was murdered.

61
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,127
   

62
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:53,617
 Hurry up and open the door! 

63
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,077
 Open up! 

64
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,637
 What's going on? 

65
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,497
 Where is Lee Ha Neul's younger brother? 

66
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:13,337
 Why are you looking for that student here? 

67
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,667
 What is this regarding exactly? 

68
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,287
 It's confidential information for our investigation. 

69
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,757
 Yeah, he left through the back door. 

70
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,667
 Get him, no matter what. 

71
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,627
 Where is Lee Ha Neul right now? 

72
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,577
 How would I know something you don't even know? 

73
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:19,827
 I'm... trying to help Lee Ha Neul. 

74
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:24,027
 That student came to me in person, asking for my help. 

75
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:27,787
 Why didn't you help him then, and now you're looking for Ha Neul here? 

76
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,797
 I'm sure Ha Neul will contact you. 

77
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:35,707
 Since he trusted you and asked for your help. 

78
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:37,987
 Please leave now. 

79
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:40,747
 I told my son that I'd be home early. 

80
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:43,207
 But I'm already very late. 

81
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:24,407
 What were you watching with this? 

82
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:33,487
 What do you care... what I watched? 

83
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,387
 Where is the tape? 

84
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,717
 - What tape? 
 - Did Lee Kang San take off with it? 

85
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:42,237
 Kang San doesn't know anything! 

86
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:44,567
 Which means you know everything about it. 

87
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:49,837
 You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you piece of trash. 

88
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,727
 You got that! 

89
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,957
Hey...

90
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:36,027
I confirmed the fact that the one who got rid of the hit-and-run case file and covered it up...

91
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:40,517
was Byeon Jong Il.

92
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:45,797
He murdered my father.

93
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:59,627
Wow, what a beautiful day.

94
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:14,517
If we find the videotape, not only the Sopyeong Lake incident,

95
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:17,967
but we can reveal the truth behind my father's death.

96
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,107
You said it wasn't among your father's belongings.

97
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:23,927
It's not that it's nonexistent, it's that we just can't find it.

98
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,427
Have you ever heard of Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple?

99
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:31,747
That's a religious cult group.

100
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:33,107
And Ahn Hyeon Mook is the cult leader.

101
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:36,517
He's the director of the Cheonyoung Orphanage, where my brother and I lived.

102
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:38,167
I know.

103
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:44,007
We have to find a man with this cross tattoo.

104
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,287
And the reason is?

105
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:50,297
This cross tattoo was on the man whose skeletal remains I found.

106
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,597
Are you sure?

107
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:53,487
I'm sure.

108
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,710
   

109
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:58,927
As a result of the NFS analysis,

110
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:03,037
    
 the piece of wood found at the crime scene of Shin Kyeong Cheol and Jeon Doo Hyeon

111
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,987
and this wooden cross matches perfectly.

112
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:09,357
As everyone is aware, this cross belongs to Byeon Jong Il's wife.

113
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:13,517
And this cross symbolizes a religious cult called Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple.

114
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:16,877
The fact that the culprit left that at the crime scene,

115
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:20,017
then it's definitely a retaliatory crime against a religious cult group.

116
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:22,347
That's not it.

117
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:26,627
If Noh Myeong Nam's statement is true, Byeon Jong Il is the one who ordered Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder.

118
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,547
There's crucial information.

119
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,887
The Cheonyoung Orphanage, where Lee Ha Neul lived, and the Cheonyoung Religion

120
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:36,147
are the forerunner to the Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple.

121
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:40,207
Ahn Hyeon Mook, who used to be the director of Cheonyoung Orphanage and the founder of the Cheonyoung Religion

122
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:43,837
is currently the Minister General of Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple.

123
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:47,167
All circumstances are ultimately connected to Lee Ha Neul.

124
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,567
We haven't identified the skeletal remains so we don't know whether Lee Ha Neul is dead or alive.

125
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:56,617
But leaving the wooden cross at the crime scene was intentional.

126
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:02,977
These hidden figures who are culprits of the Sopyeong Lake incident from 27 years ago

127
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:05,347
and the dirty cop who covered up the case.

128
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:10,970
He wanted to reveal that they were joint offenders along with the cult leader Ahn Hyeon Mook.

129
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:17,207
Cheonyoung Heavenly Temple has now become an enormous religious cult group.

130
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:21,047
Over the past three years, over 100,000 new believers have been recruited

131
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:26,307
from over 10 sects across the country. Their missionary work is very aggressive.

132
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,317
Over 100,000 believers?

133
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:33,497
Yeah. The class of believers is diverse, from students to housewives.

134
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:37,677
They lead something called a "Place of Learning" to extort money

135
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:42,137
and they gain illegal profits through multi-level product sales.

136
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,737
But why aren't they being investigated?

137
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,087
No one reports them to the police out of fear of repercussions.

138
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:52,637
But where did you get all of that intel?

139
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:56,227
You can find all that if you do good internet research.

140
00:11:56,227 --> 00:12:01,247
Even supporting certain politicians and making their power even bigger.

141
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:04,317
You've got quite the cybercrime investigator skills.

142
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,747
I'm just skilled, you know.

143
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,197
    
 Excuse me.

144
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:17,327
Hey.

145
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,210
Did you watch the news?

146
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,530
   

147
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,587
Don't be shocked and listen to me calmly.

148
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:25,617
Last night, Noh Myeong Nam...

149
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:27,867
attempted suicide.

150
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:31,297
W-What?

151
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:36,417
But more importantly, there is talk of someone faking it as a suicide.

152
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:55,417
 A man in his 60s being investigated by the police as a suspect in a murder that occurred two years ago 

153
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,407
 fell into a coma after making a suicide attempt. 

154
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,427
 Many point out that the forceful investigation by the police is the cause. 

155
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,267
 Reporter Jo Dong Min reporting. 

156
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:07,837
 Last night, near midnight, in a car parked near a laundromat in the Song District of Seoul, 

157
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,867
 a man in his 60s, A, was found unconscious. 

158
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,027
 A detective who came to investigate A late at night found him 

159
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,497
 and was taken to the hospital, but he is in critical condition. 

160
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:19,147
 Male A was arrested as a suspect in the Mt. Ogeo murder case that occurred two years ago 

161
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:20,817
 but was released for lack of evidence. 

162
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:23,877
 It seems he attempted suicide by lighting a briquette in his car. 

163
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:27,027
 The circumstances surrounding the incident is being investigated. 

164
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,197
That asshole Byeon Jong Il isn't even human.

165
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:31,217
Evidence or whatever. None of that matters.

166
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:33,767
A devil like him should be just killed.

167
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,347
You said becoming a devil to kill a devil is like committing suicide.

168
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:39,667
I take that back. That asshole will weasel out of this again.

169
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,807
Those legal experts will take care of everything as long as they get paid.

170
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:45,687
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. The answer is to pay him back for exactly what he's done.

171
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:48,237
I'm a detective! Did you forget that?

172
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:50,487
So, what did you do as a detective?

173
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:55,287
It wasn't enough that he was framed unjustly that now he's in that state. What did the detectives do?

174
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,757
- Calm downâ€” 
 - What do you mean calm down?

175
00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:01,107
Leave now. I can't trust detectives anymore. Go!

176
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,717
You may not trust me, but you trust Kang San. Right?

177
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:07,237
That's so random. What are you saying?

178
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:10,587
You said you can see and hear what other people can't see or hear. Right?

179
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:12,577
Yes.

180
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:16,527
Can you see or hear something from someone in a coma?

181
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:21,097
Are you referring to Mr. Noh Myeong Nam?

182
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:23,027
Yeah.

183
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,267
Can you help me?

184
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,647
Of course.

185
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:29,997
Hold it.

186
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,597
Are you asking Kang San to help you with the investigation?

187
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,127
I need Kang San's help.

188
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:35,817
You can't do that!

189
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,457
Hyung.

190
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,797
Talk to me for a moment.

191
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:49,757
Kang San knows nothing about Shin Kyeong Cheol's murder.

192
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:52,937
Are you acting this way because Lee Ha Neul is a suspect?

193
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,037
If Kang San finds out, he won't be able to handle it.

194
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,707
You can never let him find out.

195
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:59,357
He'll find out at some point.

196
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,967
- How can you be so cruel? 
 - Writer Yook.

197
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,377
Do you have proof that Lee Ha Neul is the culprit?

198
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:06,507
It's only your suspicions.

199
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:09,277
Besides, you said Lee Ha Neul's student ID was found with the skeletal remains.

200
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,657
Are you hoping that Lee Ha Neul is dead?

201
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:13,867
How can you interpret it that way?

202
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:18,667
Forget it. You can't use Kang San in Shin Kyeong Cheol's case.

203
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,747
Are you an accomplice to Lee Ha Neul?

204
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:22,837
What did you say?

205
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:29,267
How did you describe Shin Kyeong Cheol's murder scene so vividly in your novel?

206
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,497
Was that also in your father's records?

207
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,417
I'll answer that when we find evidence.

208
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,777
What do you mean by that?

209
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:41,697
You'll find out what I mean then.

210
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,747
Go back now.

211
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:47,317
I can't leave you out of the list of suspects.

212
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:55,417
If your father was murdered, it means you have a clear motive for the murder.

213
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:00,527
I have a definite alibi.

214
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,057
It's possible that you're an accomplice.

215
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:04,857
If that's the case, I would've never published the novel.

216
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:08,217
Unless I'm stupid, there's no reason to draw attention to myself.

217
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,517
I don't know how much I can trust you, Writer Yook.

218
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:15,417
You took the words right out of my mouth. I opened up to you because I trusted you, Detective Park.

219
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:18,187
But I didn't know you'd be so scary as to turn that around as a motive for murder.

220
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,047
Any other detective would've asked the sameâ€”

221
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:23,957
I trusted you, Detective Park! Not any other detective!

222
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,957
Whether it's an accomplice or a suspect, you can think whatever you want to think.

223
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:31,307
I cannot accept anything that puts Kang San in danger.

224
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:35,737
I'm not that insensitive, either.

225
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:41,667
I had no intention of dragging Kang San into Shin Kyeong Cheol's case.

226
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:46,357
To be honest, I don't know if I believe entirely in Kang San's so-called powers.

227
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:54,137
I'll promise you. I'll be sure what you're worried about won't happen.

228
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,960
   

229
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,650
   

230
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,877
   

231
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,360
   

232
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,247
Move!

233
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,090
   

234
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:54,617
That Byeon Jong Il, psycho.

235
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,920
How much longer are you going just let him be?

236
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,637
   

237
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:03,067
If he'd stay quiet, things would've just gone away.

238
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:06,157
Why did he have to kill someone and make all this noise?

239
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,617
He didn't die yet.

240
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,987
That's what I mean.

241
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:15,277
If he was going to kill him, he should've finished the job.

242
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:17,777
Why leave a trace? Stupid idiot.

243
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,517
Did they find his trace?

244
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,350
   

245
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:25,707
The detectives have CCTV footage from in front of his house.

246
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:27,857
What's on it?

247
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:33,227
I heard it's enough to make Byeon Jong Il suspicious as the one ordering Jeon Doo Hyeon's murder.

248
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:39,047
But the police chief just drops hints but doesn't go into details.

249
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,067
This isn't funny.

250
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:45,547
With something like that, you can be summoned.

251
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:47,257
You'll stop that for me anyway.

252
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:49,327
For how long...

253
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:54,850
do I have to get dragged around by a scumbag like that?

254
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,527
   

255
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,377
Tae Man,

256
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:04,297
if we leave Byeon Jong Il alone,

257
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:07,407
the sparks will shoot at us someday.

258
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,957
So?

259
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,277
Are you asking me to kill him for you?

260
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,277
I'm not saying that exactly.

261
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:18,927
Who was it?

262
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:23,367
I heard Byeon Jong Il's minion is your hunting dog.

263
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:28,097
I wonder if there's a way we could use him somehow.

264
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:33,087
This is why I like you.

265
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,097
You're so transparent.

266
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:40,237
You're too transparent that I can see your stomach right through.

267
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:42,287
What the hell are you talking about?

268
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,397
You want to see something interesting?

269
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,180
   

270
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,017
He looks familiar...

271
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,857
Who is it?

272
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,427
That's Ha Neul's younger brother.

273
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,677
That photo was taken recently.

274
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,787
It's not the same person?

275
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,737
I'm not sure...

276
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:26,187
Of course, it's not.

277
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:29,387
But he looks exactly like him.

278
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:34,417
It's not that he looks exactly like him... what if I said it's the same person?

279
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,537
That doesn't even make sense.

280
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,557
   

281
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:10,317
It's me.

282
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:13,547
I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say, Assemblyman.

283
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:18,657
I started feeling ill all of a sudden, so I'm at the hospital.

284
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:23,447
I have such a severe stomach ache, so I don't think I can even eat at this point.

285
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:27,637
I was so curious about the steak that you spoke so highly of.

286
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:30,417
I'm so disappointed.

287
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:34,347
I'll pick another date.

288
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:36,827
I'm sorry, Assemblyman.

289
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:47,607
Geez...

290
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:57,437
Excuse me.

291
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:17,507
We went around Noh Myeong Nam's laundromat and nearby supermarkets.

292
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,827
There were two places that sold briquettes

293
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:23,470
and Noh Myeong Nam never bought any briquettes.

294
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:27,657
That means the culprit prepared it himself.

295
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:32,607
Hey, this isn't suicide. You get the hunch. Right?

296
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:35,947
He could've bought it elsewhere, no?

297
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:38,327
Listen to your hunch, man.

298
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:41,517
Why would someone who wants to die go a distance to buy a briquette?

299
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:44,617
How about CCTVs and dashcams?

300
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:48,367
It was a blindspot for CCTVs there and there was no dashcam in Noh Myeong Nam's car.

301
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,537
They already scanned that area and picked that spot.

302
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,317
Geez, that prick is making me want to fight.

303
00:22:58,297 --> 00:23:01,477
We'll do everything we can from now on.

304
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:04,857
Look for all the cars that were in that area around that time.

305
00:23:04,857 --> 00:23:07,087
The delivery vehicles or cleanup crew. Whatever it may be.

306
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:08,897
Oh, and taxis...

307
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:12,627
Search all the records of taxis that stopped for rides that passed there at that time.

308
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:13,667
There's got to be something somewhere.

309
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,607
- All right. 
 - Got it.

310
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:21,167
Capture a snapshot from this video and send it out to everyone.

311
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,317
- What is it? 
 - The footage from in front of Byeon Jong Il's house.

312
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,057
Did you find the USB?

313
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:26,397
Detective Park had made a copy.

314
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,427
Why are you telling us that now? We checked itâ€”

315
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:30,367
Shut it.

316
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,377
You, seriously. If it weren't for Detective Park, I would've killed you.

317
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:35,597
My apologies!

318
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:37,847
Do it right if you're sorry.

319
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:42,697
Okay. Byeon Jong Il had his minion shut Noh Myeong Nam up.

320
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:47,507
If we catch this minion bastard, we can solve Jeon Doo Hyeon and Noh Myeng Nam cases.

321
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,807
But the clip doesn't show his face clearly.

322
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,537
Have you been a cop for a year or two?

323
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:53,747
We can tell even by his shadow if we know the guy!

324
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:55,377
Got it.

325
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:56,937
Move it!

326
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:09,337
   

327
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,887
Long time no see, Gwang Soo.

328
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,287
What are you doing here, Hyungnim?

329
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,137
See me for a second.

330
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:25,867
Please come into the office since you've come all the way here.

331
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:31,197
   

332
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:34,707
Do you still stay in touch with Assemblyman Byeon?

333
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,507
No. It's been a while since we'd cut ties.

334
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:39,577
Who's the guy working under Byeon Jong Il right now?

335
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,487
Gosh, I wouldn't know that.

336
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:45,450
You must hear what goes on in that field. And you have your network, too.

337
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,187
What's this about?

338
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,347
You know who this is, huh?

339
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:04,287
How would I know by looking at this? I can't even see clearly.

340
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,997
You guys could tell only by looking at the silhouette. You've got intel, too.

341
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:10,177
We cut off ties.

342
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,777
- No illegal activities in your lending office. Right? 
 - Of course not.

343
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,187
You pay taxes on time, too?

344
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:16,117
Of course.

345
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,037
Then I can shake you down, right?

346
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,827
We don't know him directly.

347
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:28,257
We just know him... through the grapevine.

348
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:30,527
What's his name?

349
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,297
   

350
00:25:59,237 --> 00:26:00,467
   

351
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:10,937
Hello?

352
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,647
 Did you enjoy your meal? 

353
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,007
Hello?

354
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:20,997
 You always eat a steak there for lunch on the second Wednesday of every month. 

355
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:29,407
 You have a golf meeting with Ahn Hyeon Mook tomorrow. Right? 

356
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:32,847
Who are you?

357
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:35,617
That's not important.

358
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,637
Time is important.

359
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,437
The time it takes for the poison to spread to your heart.

360
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:48,027
The food that you just enjoyed so much contains deadly poison.

361
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:53,117
As you may well know,

362
00:26:53,117 --> 00:26:58,347
people who'd do anything for money are just about everywhere.

363
00:27:02,927 --> 00:27:05,097
Stop rambling nonsense.

364
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:08,497
You have about five minutes left.

365
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:13,297
The time left for the poison to spread to your heart.

366
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,440
   
   

367
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,237
Are you okay?

368
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:30,287
Bring the car.

369
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,757
You must have an upset stomachâ€”

370
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:34,227
Hurry up and bring the car!

371
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,047
Oh, okay.

372
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:40,897
Come on, come out.

373
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,997
Hurry up and go to the nearest hospital.

374
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:21,377
How can you fall for such an absurdity?

375
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:27,887
Is it because you're guilty of so many crimes?

376
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:28,937
Who the hell...

377
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:30,577
Don't worry.

378
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:32,477
I'm not going to kill you that easily.

379
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,557
Stop the car. Stop the car now!

380
00:28:58,087 --> 00:28:59,927
   

381
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,357
What are you doing here?

382
00:29:57,357 --> 00:29:58,887
Hurry up and come.

383
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,957
O-Oh, well... what's it about?

384
00:30:02,957 --> 00:30:06,477
We've identified Byeon Jong Il's minion.

385
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:08,577
What are you doing, man?

386
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:09,587
Okay.

387
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:12,057
I sent the guys over to his address.

388
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,437
We should put him on a wanted list and place a travel ban on him first.

389
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,307
But I don't know when the warrant will be issued.

390
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:18,737
I requested a warrant as soon as I got your call, Hyungnim.

391
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:20,837
Hyungnim, where are you right now?

392
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:33,567
Did you check all the pictures?

393
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:38,277
I'm sorry... but I can't find it.

394
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:40,967
What do you mean you can't find it?

395
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:45,797
When I actually saw the pictures, everyone looked the same.

396
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:48,417
It's confusing.

397
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:49,877
I see...

398
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,827
I'm sorry...

399
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:57,237
It's all right. Please take a look at them again and give me a call.

400
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:01,977
Okay. I'll do that.

401
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:03,327
I'll go inside now.

402
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,217
Yes, thank you.

403
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:28,457
 Kang San can see people's dark sides. 

404
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:32,360
 People's pains, sadness, and despair. 

405
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:36,697
 People who receive his help could be a blessing for them 

406
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:41,050
 but it could be the opposite for Kang San. 

407
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:45,547
 And Kang San can't control his own powers. 

408
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:49,027
 Something dangerous could happen if you are not careful. 

409
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:51,247
 Something dangerous? 

410
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:55,217
 I don't know what might happen, either, but... 

411
00:31:55,217 --> 00:32:00,980
 the fact that Kang San doesn't have the ability to control himself makes me nervous. 

412
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:07,297
We can go back even now if you're not up to it.

413
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:09,827
I wouldn't have started if I were going to do that.

414
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,517
His cell phone is turned off as well.

415
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,187
He says it's been about an hour and a half.

416
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,937
We checked all the hospitals in the area, but he's nowhere to be found.

417
00:32:23,837 --> 00:32:27,047
I'm not sure if I should report him missing or not...

418
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:29,987
That's why I'm calling you, Minister General.

419
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:33,267
It's not good to get the police involved.

420
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:34,787
Assemblyman Byeon is a public figure.

421
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:38,847
    
 It won't be good to create any noisy rumors about him.

422
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:42,827
Don't worry, and just wait a little longer.

423
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,837
I'm sure God will lead him to where he wants him to be.

424
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:48,727
I'll do as you say, Minister General.

425
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:51,647
And with all due respect...

426
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:55,157
is my Ha Young doing well there?

427
00:32:55,157 --> 00:33:01,757
Your daughter is going through spiritual repentance, defeating Satan, and being reborn with a pure soul.

428
00:33:01,757 --> 00:33:05,477
You just have to offer your support for your daughter.

429
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:09,227
It's said that God's words will manifest just like a seal that's been carved.

430
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:14,167
Just make sure that seal is the color of sparkling gold.

431
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:19,707
Then, your daughter will be resurrected as a true golden person of the heavenly temple

432
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,377
and gain eternal life.

433
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,117
 It's not too late. 

434
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:57,847
 Forget everything and live your life. 

435
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,607
 You're a good person. 

436
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:06,297
 I know that. 

437
00:35:14,957 --> 00:35:16,827
Kang San.

438
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,987
Are you okay?

439
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:51,457
Here.

440
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:53,407
Thank you.

441
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:57,067
Is your dizziness okay?

442
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,007
I'm fine.

443
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,620
   

444
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:07,617
Yes, Writer Yook.

445
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:10,007
So, how did everything go on your end?

446
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:15,977
I think Kang San is having a hard time.

447
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:17,487
Having a hard time?

448
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:19,337
Did something happen?

449
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:21,717
Is K-Kang San okay?

450
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:23,817
 I'm fine, Hyung. 

451
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,537
Why are you there?

452
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,267
 I was next to her. 

453
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:29,137
Are you really okay?

454
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,707
Hey, man, I told you not to overdo it.

455
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:33,537
I said I'm fine.

456
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:35,847
I just got a little dizzy.

457
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:39,537
Stop nagging. I'm not a little kid.

458
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:42,727
I got it. I'm hanging up now.

459
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:44,747
 Kang San! 

460
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:46,807
What?

461
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:52,797
I think... I've infected you with lies.

462
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,617
What's wrong with you?

463
00:36:55,617 --> 00:36:57,617
I know how you feel, but...

464
00:36:57,617 --> 00:37:00,407
I'll be the one lying from now on.

465
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:02,467
So, don't lie.

466
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:06,247
But even so, you can't be honest at any given moment.

467
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,797
You have to be wise, depending on the circumstances.

468
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:12,417
Having a secret and telling a lie is different.

469
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:16,087
So, don't tell your secret just to anyone.

470
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,187
You get what I'm saying. Right?

471
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:22,517
Don't go to some random place, and just come home.

472
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:33,577
Dong Joo is such a nag.

473
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:41,467
Writer Yook worries about you a lot.

474
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:44,507
But I think I understand why after seeing you today.

475
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:46,847
I was too selfish.

476
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,597
I'm sorry.

477
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:51,747
I'm just not used to the time difference. That's all.

478
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,477
Time difference?

479
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:56,167
There's a 27-year time difference.

480
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,827
You're right.

481
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,777
By chance, do you know where Mr. Noh Myeong Nam's laundromat is?

482
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:05,687
Did you see a laundromat?

483
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:07,157
Yes.

484
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:13,747
He was inside the laundromat and some man came in.

485
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:16,237
And he looked scared.

486
00:38:21,937 --> 00:38:25,767
You can't really see his face, but take a look at his overall vibe.

487
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:29,377
His height and build.

488
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,737
He does look similar, but...

489
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:42,997
I can tell for sure if I saw his face.

490
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:48,297
And did you see anything else?

491
00:38:53,057 --> 00:38:55,997
It was dark, so I'm not certain, but...

492
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:00,107
it seemed like he was trying to...

493
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:03,487
help out someone hanging from a tree.

494
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:05,287
Hanging from a tree?

495
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:07,267
Yes.

496
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:10,277
He was holding that man's legs

497
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:13,450
and it looked like he was trying to save him somehow.

498
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:16,247
Were you in the mountains?

499
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:18,177
I think so.

500
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:21,797
And?

501
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,047
Thanks.

502
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:28,847
Don't mention it.

503
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,577
I'll drive you home.

504
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,747
No, it's oâ€”

505
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,717
Yes, Senior.

506
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:42,167
I got it. I'll go right in and check.

507
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:49,497
If I take you to the subway station, you can go home alone. Right?

508
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:50,937
Of course.

509
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:52,567
Let's go.

510
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,407
- You made it. 
 - Hi.

511
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:07,947
You heard, right?

512
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,487
About what?

513
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,287
CEO Lee hasn't told you yet?

514
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,897
I came in because he said he had something to say. Is something up?

515
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:17,877
That's not it...

516
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:25,567
I've been worrying about it alone...

517
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,517
and I thought I should meet you in person and ask you.

518
00:40:29,517 --> 00:40:31,847
That's why I asked you for a meeting.

519
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:37,877
You were with my father the longest and my father trusted you the most.

520
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:42,507
It's quite an introduction. You must have something serious to ask me.

521
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:47,157
Well... I think...

522
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:50,347
I made a huge mistake.

523
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,687
A mistake?

524
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:55,447
The most recent novel that our publishing company published...

525
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:57,457
Have you read it?

526
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:06,787
Had I known the story was connected to my brother,

527
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:09,307
I would've never published it.

528
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:12,167
For the sake of my brother and Tae Kang Group,

529
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:16,977
I should know the facts, so I can handle the situation wisely.

530
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:23,927
If you beat around the bush like that, a simpleton like me can't understand it.

531
00:41:27,677 --> 00:41:30,057
From 1995.

532
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:34,247
How close is the Sopyeong Lake incident to the novel?

533
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:36,597
Please tell me honestly.

534
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:42,097
The novel is just a novel.

535
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:50,897
And it's wise to leave the past in the past.

536
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:52,767
Does that answer your question?

537
00:41:53,757 --> 00:41:55,767
More than enough.

538
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:06,227
I'm glad the plagiarism issue has been resolved nicely.

539
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,707
You've been through a lot.

540
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:11,857
Why did they drop the lawsuit all of a sudden?

541
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:14,937
I came on pretty aggressively.

542
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:19,777
Seeing how they dropped the case tells me that it wasn't plagiarized.

543
00:42:21,877 --> 00:42:25,597
I was pretty harsh to you, huh?

544
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:27,337
I'm sorry about that.

545
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:30,797
- Are you dying? 
 - What?

546
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:34,077
They say if a person changes too suddenly, that person will die soon.

547
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:36,837
Do you have a terminal disease or something?

548
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:40,457
I've been extremely sensitive toward you.

549
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,277
I admit that.

550
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:45,477
You should start writing your next book.

551
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:48,237
The sequel to "God Is Dead."

552
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,477
A sequel?

553
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:52,010
How much longer will you be taking a break?

554
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:55,517
"God Is Dead" had an open ending...

555
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:59,367
so this time, let's go with a cool and refreshing ending.

556
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,237
Readers nowadays hate frustrating stories.

557
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:04,937
Since real life is so frustrating.

558
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:07,807
Then we should change our reality.

559
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:12,727
Make the reality cool and refreshing. Not the novel.

560
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,767
That's fantasy.

561
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:28,407
My dream is to make my fantasy come true.

562
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,737
What about marlin bones? Did you find them?

563
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:41,417
If you find them, show them to me, too.

564
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:45,027
Of course, I will.

565
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:48,947
Here.

566
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,677
What's this?

567
00:43:51,677 --> 00:43:54,517
What's wrong with a famous writer's watch?

568
00:43:54,517 --> 00:43:56,757
Consider your reputation.

569
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:58,817
Wear that one instead.

570
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:12,937
Rolexâ€”

571
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:17,197
What's wrong with you? Really.

572
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,207
Just accept a favor at its face value.

573
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:21,917
You're not the type to do me a favor for no reason.

574
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:24,017
It's a gift to express my apology.

575
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:26,117
More so, not the type to apologize.

576
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:27,337
Hey, Yook Dong Joo...

577
00:44:27,337 --> 00:44:29,437
Wow!

578
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:32,457
This is super expensive, huh?

579
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:40,957
Anyway, thanks.

580
00:44:42,437 --> 00:44:44,247
But...

581
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:53,087
this watch is a real masterpiece.

582
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,427
- A masterpiece? 
 - It's my father's keepsake.

583
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,617
I see. It's meaningful.

584
00:44:59,617 --> 00:45:02,037
It has a special meaning.

585
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:07,537
- I'm off. 
 - I'll look forward to your next book.

586
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:09,697
All right.

587
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:11,467
Look forward to it.

588
00:45:35,137 --> 00:45:38,227
I don't know what he's plotting.

589
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:50,307
Hi, Mom.

590
00:45:50,307 --> 00:45:51,587
 I remembered! 

591
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:52,367
What?

592
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:56,507
I remembered who I gave your dad's toy car.

593
00:45:57,207 --> 00:46:00,557
I think I gave it to Young Dae's father when we moved.

594
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,400
   

595
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,247
   

596
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:17,727
Did the DNA test result come out?

597
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:19,817
 It's not a match. 

598
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,477
Geez!

599
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:27,337
Is Assembly Byeon's cell phone still off?

600
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:29,757
I told his aide to bring in Assemblyman Byeon.

601
00:46:29,757 --> 00:46:32,007
So I think he turned it off on purpose.

602
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:39,417
Should I leak a part of the video clip to his aide?

603
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,327
To scare him.

604
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:43,767
It's a great idea.

605
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:50,037
Are there any DNA matches from the missing people?

606
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:54,127
Really? Thank you.

607
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:56,307
What's the call about?

608
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:57,837
It was the NFS.

609
00:46:57,837 --> 00:47:02,697
The DNA of the skeletal remains didn't match any of the missing.

610
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:06,617
Then, is it more likely that it was Lee Ha Neul?

611
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:08,617
It's not Lee Ha Neul.

612
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,877
How do you know that?

613
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:12,397
We don't have DNA even to compare.

614
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:13,577
W-Well...

615
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:18,057
Seeing the age... and the build is bigger than Lee Ha Neul.

616
00:47:18,057 --> 00:47:19,757
But it's not for sure, though.

617
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:21,607
Yeah, right.

618
00:47:21,607 --> 00:47:23,847
If all the circumstances are pointing at Lee Ha Neul,

619
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:28,617
we should direct our investigation to the fact that Lee Ha Neul is alive.

620
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:31,427
Well, that's true.

621
00:47:32,117 --> 00:47:34,117
Did you figure out Noh Myeong Nam's movements?

622
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,267
Yes.

623
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:38,767
- Send the video clip to the aide first. 
 - Oh, yes.

624
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,747
See me for a minute.

625
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,717
I'm sure it's hard to believe, but everything I told you is true.

626
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:57,127
He's not Lee Kang San's son...

627
00:47:58,787 --> 00:48:01,697
but he's the real Lee Kang San?

628
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:03,757
Yes.

629
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,917
I thought you should know, Senior.

630
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:13,057
I can't believe it.

631
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,777
Of course not.

632
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:18,477
I'm still bewildered. It's amazing.

633
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:23,017
It's a sad thing.

634
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:28,047
The brothers will get to meet someday...

635
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:03,827
When did you come?

636
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:05,437
Just now...

637
00:49:06,397 --> 00:49:07,937
ma'am.

638
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,997
Come in.

639
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:35,557
Why are you standing there like that?

640
00:49:36,637 --> 00:49:39,237
When I walked in here,

641
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:43,447
I felt like I walked into the past.

642
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,637
And this door crosses over time.

643
00:49:52,897 --> 00:49:55,377
Outside this door is the future...

644
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,627
and it's the past here.

645
00:50:02,557 --> 00:50:04,177
No...

646
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,077
The present for me.

647
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:11,937
That'd be so nice.

648
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:21,437
Did something happen?

649
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:24,447
Something to be happy about happened.

650
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:26,867
Something to be happy about?

651
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,357
Ha Neul is alive.

652
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:35,317
I believed he was alive, but...

653
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:39,297
I was still a little bit afraid.

654
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:42,357
But I confirmed today that my brother is alive.

655
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,097
Really...

656
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:49,947
It's really good news.

657
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,377
It's the best news ever.

658
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,497
But why do you look like that?

659
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:01,127
Brother was crying.

660
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:05,857
He was crying...

661
00:51:07,887 --> 00:51:09,827
so sadly.

662
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,467
So sadly...

663
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:18,737
Brother was crying.

664
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:26,377
As Dong Joo said, it would've been good if I went to the past.

665
00:51:28,477 --> 00:51:31,157
Since I know what will happen,

666
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:34,797
I could change things.

667
00:51:37,037 --> 00:51:39,767
Stop things from happening to Brother...

668
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:44,317
and rescue Dong Joo's father, too.

669
00:51:48,557 --> 00:51:51,307
I'd know the lottery ticket numbers in advance...

670
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:54,157
so I'd win...

671
00:51:55,807 --> 00:51:58,287
and buy a house to live in with Brothe.

672
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:04,277
My brother would go to college, too...

673
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:12,177
I just need to be with Brother...

674
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:18,187
That's all I need...

675
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:30,757
â™«  Get out of this swirling place  â™«

676
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:38,977
â™«  Look at the real you in your frozen smile  â™«

677
00:52:40,777 --> 00:52:42,527
I told you.

678
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:45,597
I've never seen a wooden toy car.

679
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:48,377
But Mom was so confident as she was telling me.

680
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:50,177
We rummaged through your house for no reason.

681
00:52:50,177 --> 00:52:52,177
That's fine.

682
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:56,137
Hey, this must be super expensive. Are you sure it's okay to give it to me?

683
00:52:56,137 --> 00:52:58,267
I didn't buy it anyway.

684
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:01,197
I get to enjoy some luxury thanks to my friend.

685
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:04,847
So, why are you looking for a wooden toy car?

686
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,577
I was wondering if the marlin bones were in there.

687
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:14,167
 What's marlin bones? 

688
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,547
A videotape.

689
00:53:20,147 --> 00:53:22,257
A videotape?

690
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:26,617
Dong Joo, just open up and tell me everything now.

691
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:31,827
How are your dad's hit-and-run and Sopyeong Lake incident entangled?

692
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:43,397
It's a long story, but I'll make it short.

693
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:49,877
My father got too close to the truth behind the Sopyeong Lake incident.

694
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:51,917
That's why he was murdered.

695
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:58,197
And that videotape has footage of the incident at Sopyeong Lake.

696
00:53:59,317 --> 00:54:02,357
And Father hid that somewhere.

697
00:54:03,187 --> 00:54:05,977
It's possible it's inside the wooden toy car.

698
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:09,517
I know the culprit...

699
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:13,007
from 27 years ago.

700
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:17,877
And the one who covered up that incident...

701
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:20,887
was Byeon Jong Il.

702
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:33,737
Hey, my head is spinning.

703
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:42,127
There's an even crazier story to this.

704
00:54:44,637 --> 00:54:46,817
But wait for me on that one.

705
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:49,957
Okay. Tell me when you're ready.

706
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:54,697
Oh, the video clip I told you about yesterday.

707
00:54:54,697 --> 00:54:56,977
Oh, right. Let me see it.

708
00:54:59,217 --> 00:55:02,317
It felt like they were mafia or something.

709
00:55:05,027 --> 00:55:06,487
Here.

710
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:09,957
This guy is the detective from Violent Crimes Team 3.

711
00:55:10,857 --> 00:55:14,407
You said he's on the same team as Detective Park. Right?

712
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:17,147
Yeah. But it's vague to hand this over to the police because

713
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,217
it didn't capture Byeon Jong Il's face.

714
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:21,407
I couldn't hear anything, either.

715
00:55:21,407 --> 00:55:23,507
Send it to me for now.

716
00:55:23,507 --> 00:55:25,280
What are you going to do?

717
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:28,797
I can get in trouble for surveillance.

718
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:31,947
Hey, I'll keep my source completely confidential.

719
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:36,750
Writer Yook!

720
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:39,287
What brings you all the way here?

721
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:42,587
It didn't seem appropriate to tell you over the phone, so I came in person.

722
00:55:42,587 --> 00:55:45,077
Did something happen to Kang San?

723
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:46,787
That's not it.

724
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:51,597
There's a video clip you should take a look at.

725
00:55:51,597 --> 00:55:53,467
A video clip?

726
00:55:55,947 --> 00:55:59,177
It was recorded near the Han River last night.

727
00:56:00,577 --> 00:56:02,827
He's a detective on your team. Right?

728
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:04,417
That's right.

729
00:56:05,277 --> 00:56:07,817
Who's inside the car?

730
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,877
It's Byeon Jong Il.

731
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:23,367
Let me go home. Please show up.

732
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:31,077
Do you still have a stomach ache?

733
00:56:32,177 --> 00:56:33,710
No.

734
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,587
If you're tired, get some sleep.

735
00:56:36,587 --> 00:56:38,437
Looks like we'll stay up all night.

736
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:42,587
- It's okay. 
 - Come on. Sleep when I tell you to.

737
00:56:42,587 --> 00:56:44,797
So, we can switch.

738
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:47,687
Hyungnim.

739
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:49,387
What?

740
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:52,587
You know I like you a lot, don't you?

741
00:56:54,747 --> 00:56:56,640
Are you really sick?

742
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,987
What's with you? So gross...

743
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:05,967
Thank you for always being good to me.

744
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:10,357
Just sleep, man.

745
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:18,210
Where are you going?

746
00:57:18,777 --> 00:57:20,447
To the restroom.

747
00:57:21,747 --> 00:57:23,297
I'll be right back.

748
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:44,317
That crazy bastard!

749
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:46,607
What do we do now?

750
00:57:47,737 --> 00:57:49,967
Geez, I'm going nuts here.

751
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:53,477
That blabbermouth! Crazy bastard!

752
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,207
Excuse me...

753
00:57:57,577 --> 00:57:59,917
I'm here to see Team Leader Oh.

754
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:02,007
How can I help you?

755
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,327
I don't think Assemblyman Byeon can make it here tomorrow.

756
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:15,967
- Are you his aide? 
 - Yes.

757
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,327
Must we force the summons?

758
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:20,927
You think the police are that easy? Are we your pushovers?

759
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:22,267
You saw the video clip. Right?

760
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:24,607
What do you think will happen if we expose it to the press?

761
00:58:24,607 --> 00:58:27,577
Cut the bullshit and tell him to show up here tomorrow!

762
00:58:27,577 --> 00:58:30,697
If he ignores us again, I'll expose that to the press. So do whatever you want!

763
00:58:30,697 --> 00:58:35,307
That's not it. We haven't been able to reach Assemblyman for a few hours now.

764
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:00,507
Long time no see.

765
00:59:14,227 --> 00:59:16,047
Look over there.

766
00:59:17,997 --> 00:59:21,087
I'll ask you questions from now on.

767
00:59:21,087 --> 00:59:24,007
You can live if you answer honestly.

768
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:26,947
If not, you're dead.

769
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:38,467
Loosen this now!

770
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:40,277
Wait a minute!

771
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:47,057
If you let me go now, I won't tell anyone.

772
00:59:47,057 --> 00:59:49,647
I'm sure the police are looking for me already.

773
00:59:49,647 --> 00:59:52,337
It's only a matter of time until you get caught.

774
00:59:52,337 --> 00:59:57,257
If you let me go, I promise you this never happened.

775
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:02,937
I don't think they reported you missing yet.

776
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:04,277
What?

777
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:09,147
It means I'm not the only one who wants you gone.

778
01:00:15,497 --> 01:00:20,187
The only way for you to leave here alive is to be honest.

779
01:00:21,677 --> 01:00:23,827
How do I believe you?

780
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:26,667
I'm different from you.

781
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:29,387
I keep my promises.

782
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:47,337
All right.

783
01:00:47,337 --> 01:00:49,407
Shall we begin?

784
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:57,337
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

785
01:01:06,147 --> 01:01:07,817
Yes.

786
01:01:07,817 --> 01:01:10,717
 Are you Writer Yook Dong Joo? 

787
01:01:10,717 --> 01:01:11,987
Yes, it's me.

788
01:01:11,987 --> 01:01:15,697
 I'm Choi Woo Jeong. 

789
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:21,177
I'm sorry to call you out of the blue.

790
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,767
No, it's okay.

791
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,827
I heard about you from Kang San.

792
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:26,267
Yes.

793
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:31,707
By chance, are you with Kang San?

794
01:01:34,297 --> 01:01:37,170
Kang San was here this afternoon.

795
01:01:37,817 --> 01:01:42,327
But I was very worried. That's why I'm calling.

796
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:47,657
Hyung!

797
01:01:50,797 --> 01:01:52,637
Over here!

798
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,840


799
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:15,277
What are you doing here?

800
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:17,167
Waiting for you, Hyung.

801
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:23,407
I think you like me too much.

802
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:27,537
- What? 
 - If you come out and wait for me like this,

803
01:02:27,537 --> 01:02:30,367
I'm feeling the pressure, man.

804
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,587
Well, what can I do?

805
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,867
I have no choice...

806
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:39,447
but to live with you for the rest of my life.

807
01:02:40,547 --> 01:02:44,567
It's too much pressure for me because you seem to like me too much.

808
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:46,127
Me?

809
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:49,007
I shouldn't have waited for him.

810
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:50,247
Let's go in.

811
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:51,547
Kang San.

812
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:52,827
Why are you calling me?

813
01:02:52,827 --> 01:02:54,147
Lee Kang San!

814
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:56,267
What?

815
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:02,357
I just tried calling my one and only brother's name.

816
01:03:05,987 --> 01:03:08,607
You and me, us...

817
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,867
Let's not be disappointed, no matter what happens.

818
01:03:15,277 --> 01:03:17,717
This is the beginning for us.

819
01:03:20,437 --> 01:03:22,627
We can't stop what happened in the past.

820
01:03:22,627 --> 01:03:24,947
But the important thing is what happens next.

821
01:03:25,837 --> 01:03:29,597
Before today becomes tomorrow's past,

822
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,667
what's important is what we're going to do from now on.

823
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,577
We can start now.

824
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:41,367
Starting now...

825
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:45,437
We'll start now.

826
01:03:47,427 --> 01:03:51,527
â™«  I will continue to fight  â™«

827
01:03:54,957 --> 01:04:01,497
â™«  Can never stop the destiny that lies before me  â™«

828
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:08,677
â™«  No matter how many times I'm born again  â™«

829
01:04:08,677 --> 01:04:13,737
â™«  I'll put myself in the midst of this tough world  â™«

830
01:04:13,737 --> 01:04:21,177
â™«  Take away what tormented me and made me sad  â™«

831
01:04:21,177 --> 01:04:24,357
   

832
01:04:24,357 --> 01:04:27,677
 You should take your revenge on them! Why are you doing this to me? 

833
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:31,247
 You're not the one I want to put an end to. 

834
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,327
 It's all over if this video gets out! 

835
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,777
 I can't help it if he knows too much. 

836
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:38,177
 I really remembered. I have it. 

837
01:04:38,177 --> 01:04:40,117
 I think he's been abducted. 

838
01:04:40,117 --> 01:04:42,987
 Why did you kill so many people? 

839
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:45,027
 I couldn't stop what has already happened 

840
01:04:45,027 --> 01:04:46,527
 but the important thing is what happens starting now. 

841
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:50,317
 Brother wasn't qualified nor capable of leading Taekang Group, to begin with. 

842
01:04:50,317 --> 01:04:51,587
 You have me. 

843
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,877
 I don't trust the press. 

844
01:04:52,877 --> 01:04:54,537
 The higher-ups will accept all your conditions. 

845
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:57,497
 Not punishing the crime is... 

846
01:04:57,497 --> 01:05:00,247
 I heard you have a special reason for being here. 

847
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:04,037
 It's the same as giving strength to the crimes of tomorrow. 

848
01:05:04,997 --> 01:05:08,637
â™«  Can never stop the destiny that lies before me  â™«
