00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,350
I don't think I can keep this ring.

00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,890
I'll let go of you

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,450

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,600
It's over now.

9
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,650
It's the right decision.

10
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,930
How long are you going to
date Joo-in like this?

11
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,080
We'll decide when we're
ready to get married.

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,650
Aren't you tired of pretending
to be dating each other?

You knew?

14
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,040
I thought that with time,
you could make her your real girlfriend.

I wish it's not hard on you.

I like it

34
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,770
when you call me "mom".

35
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,190
You also

36

have a pretty name.

37
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,950
Whenever you call me "mom",

38
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,840
it gives me the strength

39
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,579
to be a confident woman.

You have nothing to be sorry about.

After having you,

46
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,380
I sighed with dismay about
how I had suddenly become a single mom.

47
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,840
But you held onto my finger

That's not so special.
I've waited so long for this date.

I didn't say they broke up.

Why did you make us concerned
over a short-lived romance?

123

I didn't ask for your concern.

You changed a lot
after you started dating Ms. Oh.

128

Oh, I didn't change that much.

129
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,410
You gave me dating advice.
That's something you never did before.

130
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,000
And you encouraged Jae-hwan
to write scene plots.

131

That's right. I've got other evidence too.

That was excruciating.

But when you came to check on me,

strange then. I was reticent.

Being the company CEO has its drawbacks.

168
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,630
People get nervous around me.

169
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
So it's hard to make friends.

170
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,390
I was wondering why you
asked to see me today.

171
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,700
The judging event we held was a success.

172
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,590
And the photos of you two
turned out great.

173
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,150
Right.

174
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,670
I want to talk about stuff

175
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,470
not related to work.

176
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,760
I knew that you were dating Mr. Han

177
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,770
from the very beginning.

178
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,130
He's got to be a great guy, right?

179
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,020
Otherwise, how could you have dated him?

180
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,500
I know you can't control
who you're attracted to

181
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,100
and who you're not.

182
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,490
And it's hard

183
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,840
to give your heart to someone else.

184
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,350
Yu-jin will not stop loving you.

185
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,710
I'm very well aware of that.

186
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
You probably don't know

187
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,040
how it feels to have a one-sided crush.

188
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,600
Let me ask for a favor.

189
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,240
If you really care about Yu-jin,

190
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,680
could you think of a way

191
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
to sort things out between you and Yu-jin?

192
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,560
Excuse me.

193
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,490
[Yu-jin]

194
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,080
I'll head to the office. Bye.

195
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,420
Hey, Yu-jin.

196
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,820
[Joo-in, I'm not feeling well today.]

197
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,880
I'll be there right away.

198
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,700
What are you doing?

199
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,360
You almost gave me a heart attack.

200
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,960
We can't have that.

201
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,690
What do you want to do today?

202
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,860
Stay

203
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,630
here for the night.

204
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,090
I have to think about it first.

205
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,480
Why?

206
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,670
I want to be together with you.

207
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,070
What will we do?

208
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,930
You're worried about getting bored
if you stay for the night?

209
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,060
No.

210
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,670
Would one night be enough?

211
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,150
Until you tell me to leave,

212
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,930
I won't let go of your arm.
I'll stick to you all night.

213
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,109
Yu-jin!

214
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,270
Yu-jin?

215
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,060
Joo-in!

216
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,910
What is this?

217
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,410
Rather than being with you
for a fleeting time,

218
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,400
I want to bring you happiness every day.

219
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,300
I've always loved you

220
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,440
since the first time I saw you.

221
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,420
My love will never waver.
Even in the future.

222

223

Yu-jin, I--

225
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,650
I promise you

226
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,500
that I'll make you smile

227
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,140
the moment you wake up

228
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,370
and the moment you go to bed.

229
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,010
I'll find your misplaced belongings too.

230
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,330
I'm not going to fill the empty space
that Bi-soo left behind.

231
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,930
It's not my style.

232
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,440
I want to be together with you,

233
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,500
and I'll do it my own way.

234
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,950
As a friend, I was there for you.

235
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,180
So if we become a real couple,

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,450
imagine how better I'll be to you.

237
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,310
And tell me your answer later.

238
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,300
Sorry.

239
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,570
For making you go through chemo.

240
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm delighted

241
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,170
that I can fulfill the favor you
asked of me.

242
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,240
In my life,

243
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,790
do you know when was
the hardest period for me?

244
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,320
When Dad died?

245
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,730
And when I gave birth to you.

246
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,150
And when I was told
I only had a few months to live.

247
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,150
Why do such things
only happen to you, Mom?

248
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,260
I also felt that way.

249
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,860
But you know...

250
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,490
The moments that I thought were so unfair

251
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,950
turned out to be
my most cherished moments.

252
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,770
Why?

253
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,260
When you were born,

254
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:19,660
I realized that I could love
someone more than myself.

255
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,820
When I learned I was going to die,

256
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,610
I learned how precious life is.

257
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,610
Just being alive is so wonderful.

258
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,280
We will be

259
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,970
able to meet soon.

260
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,950
What do you mean?

261
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,220
Even if you go sooner than me,

262
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,430
heaven is supposed to be a place
of happiness and joy.

263
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,450
So enjoy it.

264
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,930
And in a blink of an eye,

265
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,420
we'll see each other again.

266

No matter how nice heaven is,
it can't compare to this life.

267

Take your time before coming.

268
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,990
When you feel better,
let's go on a short trip together.

269

After his mother passed away,
he was probably grieving.

How did he manage to finish 5 scripts

He was probably in a miserable state.

He doesn't show it,

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,690
But you don't change your mind easily.

333
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,960
I guess this time, I did.

334
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,280
Bi-soo didn't say anything?

335
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,180
He has to accept it.

336
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,420
It must be hard for you.

337
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,060
I'm all right.

338
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,710
-Is Bi-soo staying in your home?
-Yes.

339
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,820
It seems like Bi-soo
still has feelings for you.

340
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,420
Otherwise,

341
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,940
he would have left your home by now.

342
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,500
He's looking for a new place.

343
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,450
["Guitarist, Female Killer", Episode 14]

344
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,040
-Yes?
[-It's me, Hee-jung.]

345
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,010
[I got your number
from the hospital chairwoman.]

346
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,070
Why did you want to see me?

347
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,380
You want to hear that and then go?

348
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,070
You haven't changed.

349
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Back when we were dating,

350
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,230
do you know why I broke up with you?

351
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,260
It seemed like you could manage life

352
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,110
without a problem even without me in it.

353
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,130
To test you, I said I wanted to break up.

354
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,700
But you didn't ask me any questions

355
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,420
and agreed to it.

356
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,330
I thought you no longer liked me.

357
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,760
You did?

358
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,580
What should we do?
Should we start going out again?

359
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm not interested in dating anyone.

360
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,230
The person you recently broke up
with is Joo-in, right?

361
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,320
Even if you're dating someone else,

362
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,550
you could still have
lingering feelings for an ex.

363
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,030
It was nice to know you.

364
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,170
You're not going to see me again?

365
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,730
No. I don't like having guy friends.

366
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,390
Don't pretend to be okay.
Have a good life.

367
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,330
Bye.

368
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,470
Hi, Ms. Oh.

369
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,400
I don't want to get involved in
your personal relationship.

370
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,370
But I just don't understand.

371
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,880
Here.

372
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,130
Once Bi-soo likes someone,
he doesn't easily stop liking them.

373
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,740
He can't use public restrooms.

374
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,470
He has to write in a designated spot.

375
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,690
And it's the same with his personal life.

376
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm probably not the right person for him.

377
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,970
Bi-soo changed a lot
after he started dating you.

378
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,650
I know. I can see that.

379
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,750
He doesn't close his door anymore.

380
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,850
On the other hand, he's closed his heart.

381
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,830
So are you going to end it like this?

382
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,590
Bi-soo said that he used

383
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,080
our relationship to draw inspiration
for writing his scripts.

384
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,440
That's just a lame excuse.

385
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,710
Even if he has another reason,

386
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,860
our relationship can't last
if he keeps it a secret.

387
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,910
There's something else that he's
not telling us. I can't figure it out.

388
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,210
Speak of the devil.

389
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,450
-What are you doing here, Dae-young?
-Oh, gosh.

390
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,730
He's got such a way with words.

391
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,910
Don't you agree, Ms. Oh?

392
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,800
I hardly know him now.

393
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,150
I see.

394
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,370
I'll personally give you two
a drive to the script rehearsal tomorrow.

395
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,310
Have you ever seen an agency president
chauffeur his clients?

396
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,540
I'd rather go with Gwang-ja.

397
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,300
Oh, all right.

398
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,190
-Come to my room.
-No.

399
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,130
I'd like to chat and enjoy
my coffee here with Ms. Oh and you.

400
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,430
Come now.

401
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,340
You have her poster hung in your room.

402
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,230
And you suddenly don't like her anymore?

403
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,860
It helps with writing my scripts.

404
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,540
I need it until I'm finished.

405
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,940
Tell me why you are pretending
you no longer like her.

406
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,950
Why is it so hard for you to believe me?

407
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,850
Even though you're grieving
the loss of your mother,

408
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,870
you shouldn't treat someone
you love like that.

409
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,470
You'll never find another girl
as special as her.

410
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,800
Did you find me a new place?

411
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,420
I'm looking. But I can't find
an appropriate house. I'll look more.

412
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,780
Take time off from writing.

413
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,620
I don't have time to take time off.

414
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,590
I'll handle this.

415
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,040
My Jae-hwan.

416
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,200
Oh, gosh. Get some rest.

417
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,890
Mr. Han is churning out these scripts,

418
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,780
so how can I take a break?

419
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,240
Are you in pain?

420
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,850
It's my wisdom tooth.

421
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,650
I didn't know it was growing.

422
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,290
But I discovered it yesterday.

423
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,840
Let me have a look.

424
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,800
I had two wisdom teeth pulled out.
It hurts, doesn't it?

425
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
Yes, it does.

426
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,620
But it's bearable.

427
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,600
I'll wait a little longer
to get it pulled out.

428
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,810
Pull it out now.

429
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,750
It doesn't hurt that much.

430
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,639
Jae-hwan, why is this so trite to you?

431
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,120
It's just a tooth.

432
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,980
It's painful to
have your tooth pulled out,

433
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,909
so Joo-in must be hurting even more

434
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:29,230
because she has to banish him
from her heart.

435
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,120
It's probably tough on her.

436
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,389
Han Bi-soo! He's despicable.

437
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,820
She rescued his show from being dropped.

438
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,540
How could he break up with her?

439
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,270
Personal relationships are complicated.

440
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,690
They probably have their reasons.

441
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,389
I always hated the ending of
"The Little Mermaid".

442
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,199
Instead of turning into foam

443
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,179
because she was in love with the prince,

444
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,610
she should've killed him
to save her own life.

445
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,260
Gwang-ja, relax.

446
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,989
You're getting carried away.
This is Ms. Oh's personal problem.

447
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,590
How can you say that?

448
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,530
Joo-in is a celebrity,
but she's also like a sister to me.

449
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,590
If we're talking about that,
Mr. Han is my role model.

450
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,660
How can you choose him as your role model?

451
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,550
Are you taking that despicable guy's side?

452
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,440
No, I'm not...

453
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,810
I'm always on your side.

454
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,210
Let's take a break in our relationship.
I'm very disappointed in you.

455
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,340
But...

456
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,330
You're peeking at my stuff.

457
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,650
You said you were too busy to draw me.

458
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,170
But you had time to draw Joo-in.
It's so pretty.

459
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,700
I asked Joo-in to marry me.

460
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,210
Really?

461
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,520
What did she say?

462
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,620
She hasn't answered me yet.

463
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,980
What if she says no?

464
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,060
If that's how she feels,
I'll have to accept it.

465
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,770
You really like her.

466
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,340
Did you know about what recently
happened to Mr. Han?

467
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,480
What?

468
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,200
Mom.

469
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,280
Am I doing the right thing?

470
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,190
This is all I can

471
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,420
do for her.

472
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,690
Yes, Yu-jin.

473
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,030
I heard the news.

474
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,010
Bi-soo's mother passed away.

475
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,070
Why didn't you tell me about it?

476
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,250
[Bi-soo doesn't like]

477
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,020
telling other people
about his personal stuff.

478
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,580
Are you all right?

479
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,530
Me? I'm okay.

480
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,420
I'm really okay.

481
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Since you're alone in the nursing home,
you must miss her a lot.

482
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,280
It goes deeper than that.

483
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,930
I grieve her loss.

484
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,160
Did you pack her things?

485
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,400
No. If I send all of her things away,

486
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,880
it'll feel like I'm really letting her go.

487
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,570
She had a living funeral
to say farewell to us.

488
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,130
Shouldn't we also give

489
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,330
a big farewell party in her honor?

490
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,780
I'm not ready for that yet.

491
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,020
Saying goodbye is nice.

492
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,210

Are you okay, Joo-in?

659
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,960
Joo-in, wake up.

660
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,600
Oh, no! Joo-in!

661
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,730
The doctor says you're suffering
from stress and fatigue.

662
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,790
You ended up in the hospital.

663
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,390
Stay here for a few days and recover.

664
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,740
I don't need to be hospitalized.

665
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:50,400
Let's reduce your schedule.
You need to rest.

666
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,710
It's better to keep working.

667
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,860
Listen to me.

668
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,450
If I don't see Jae-hwan even for one day,

669
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,010
I feel like I'll get sick.

670
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,230
But you don't talk to Bi-soo
even though he's in the house.

671
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,910
That's worse.

672
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,820
I'll get some sleep.

673
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,290
Okay.

Mr. Han.

Why aren't you in the office?

678
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,590
I went to see Gwang-ja.
She's at a hospital.

679
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,230
She's sick?

680

No.

681
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,860
Actually, Joo-in is hospitalized.

682
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,330
Why?

683
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,190
She collapsed during a photo shoot today.

684
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,330
I told you not to tell Mr. Han
that she was here.

685
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,640
You don't listen to me sometimes.

686

Hang up!

-It's your fault that she's sick.
-How is her condition?

I'll leave after I just check on her.

You don't have to avoid me
if that's your reason.

It's better than the way
you're treating me

708
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,360
as if I'm invisible.

Don't try to understand it
if it's confusing.

Although I don't understand it,
I can accept it.

Do you know what it means
to disappear into thin air?

You can't see me

You can't hug me even if you want to.

I can patiently wait and hug you later.

720

I can't wipe your tears.

Why would I cry?
You're suffering more than me.

You better not cry.

724
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:30,740
When my mom couldn't
recognize me once, you told me

725
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,890
she was helping me practice a different
role other than a daughter role.

726
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,550
And that I can enjoy playing
a different character.

From now on,

I'll play a character who is
in love with a vanishing person.

You lost your dad so suddenly,

00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,690
and now you're caring
for your ailing mother.

On top of that, you want this burden?

732

Losing my dad hurt a lot.

But I was also happy.

returned to my old family home.

-It's painful.
-You're not me!

Why did you make your own conclusions?
It's tough on me.

What you're doing now is not helping.

740

It's for your own sake.

You're acting selfishly.
