A change in her environment?

163

We'll run some tests as soon as possible.

164
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,300
Let's talk after we get the results.

165
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,810
Okay, Doctor. Thank you.

-What?
-You know why I'm calling.

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,190
You met with her so tell me how it went.

172
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,500
How did it go? Did you meet her?

173
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,020
-I met her.
-You did? How did it go?

174
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,410
What did she say?

175
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,750
Will she take the role or not?

176

Hey, you should've used any means possible

179

[Give Oh Joo-in some time to decide.]

Get some rest, Dae-young.

Did he get home safely?

186
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,540
It's not easy to catch a taxi here.

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,770
Joo-in, what are you doing here?

188
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,240
I came after finishing a shoot
because I missed you.

189
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,390
I caused another commotion, didn't I?

190
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,450
No, you didn't.

191
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,570
I'm sorry for making you come here
when you're so busy.

192
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,140
Being with you is better than resting.

Mom, you don't want to come home, do you?

I'll stop badgering you.

Just tell me when you're ready
to come home.

196

All I want is for you to stay healthy
in a place where you feel comfortable.

197
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,560
Okay.

-Are you okay? I'm so sorry.
-I told you to be careful.

Gosh, that hurt a lot.

Thank you.

201
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,180
How is your arm?

202
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,890
Han Bi-soo is the worst.

203
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,280
He's a lunatic, you know.

204
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,640
I asked to make a few changes
because the scene was hard to stomach.

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,570
But he charged right at me like a maniac.

206
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
So I pushed him away.

207
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
Then I twisted my arm.

208
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,570
And slipped and fell.

209
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,080
Oh, so...

210
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,190
So you fell by yourself
after trying to push him?

211
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,890
It wasn't like that.
I suggested that we make a few changes

212
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,570
because the scene was tough for me.

213
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,670
Shouldn't he at least listen to
what I had to say?

214
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,190
If nothing was wrong
with the scene, why change it?

215
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,450
You asked for changes
because you couldn't handle the scene.

216
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,680
I can see why he got mad at you.

217
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Hey! Untie these for me!

218
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,750
Excuse me!

219
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,750
Mr. Han, did you stay up all night
working here?

220
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,610
You look very tired.

221
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,080
All the free time you've been
getting has improved your skin tone.

222
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,610
I would like to work,
but the studio has no projects.

223
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,260
So why did you have to tell Oh Joo-in off?

224
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,780
I mean, you had your reasons.

225
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,000
Anyway, I'm going to
work hard starting today.

226
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,170
The boss and I furnished the home.
Do you like it?

227
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,360
Well...

228
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,210
You guys made an effort.

229
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,190
I have to get my old home back.

230
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,670
The boss told me to call him right away

231
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,690
if Oh Joo-in calls us.

232
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,870
You'll call him, right?

233
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm sure he's waiting anxiously.

234
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,490
What's the point of writing this?

235
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,130
The network won't pick up the show
if Oh Joo-in doesn't play the lead.

236
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm here to save your life.

237
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,960
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,600
It's you.

239
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,530
I saw you there that day.

240
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,620
That's right.

241
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,490
When you had the accident,
I told you who I was.

242
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,560
The person who would save my life?

243
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,320
You have a good memory.

244
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,140
You're going to die.

245
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,370
-What?
-I gave you an extension on life.

246
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,510
You don't have much time left.

247
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,990
-Think about how to make it count.
-What?

248
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,980
What was that?

249
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,160
I saw him not once but twice.

250
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,800
He was standing right in front of me.

251
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,430
-You're hallucinating.
-I can tell what's real and what's not.

252
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,530
-Have you ever heard the sound of rain?
-What?

253
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,460
What does falling rain sound like?

254
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,560
Patter, tap, splash.

255
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,450
Are you sure that's how it really sounds?

256
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,310
Then what does it sound like?
Why are we suddenly talking about rain?

257
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,700
You gave examples of how rain sounds

258
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,060
when it hits the floor, a roof,
a tree, or an umbrella.

259
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,290
Rain doesn't make any sound.

260
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,230
So what you've heard so far
wasn't the sound of rain.

261
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,760
You mistakenly thought
it was how rain sounded.

262
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,230
When people miraculously
survive from accidents,

263
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
they experience lingering effects.

264
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,850
I heard that your show got canceled.

265
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,690
Obviously, that's very stressful.

266
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,760
And your mom sold your home
without asking you first.

267
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,120
But it was too real for a hallucination.

268
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,690
It was so vivid. Terrifyingly so.

269
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,650
There is a way to tell

270
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,940
if it was real or not.

271
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,410
Take a selfie?

272
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,890
I didn't expect a doctor
with 30 years of experience

273
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,079
to suggest I take a selfie.

274
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,230
How am I supposed to
take a selfie with a ghost?

275
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,270
If he's not human and a ghost,
then his face won't appear in the selfie?

276
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,000
-You're going to die.
-What?

277
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,099
I gave you an extension on life.

278
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,900
You don't have much time left.

279
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,000
Think about how to make it count.

280
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,770
He said I was going to die.

281
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,510
Everyone dies eventually.

282
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,460
An extension on life?

283
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,070
I don't care. Darn it.

284
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,100
The board and I want to
use the government funds

285
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,830
to expand the VIP patient rooms.

286
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,420
But the medical staff oppose that idea

287
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,400
and want to expand
the Trauma Center instead.

288
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,970
Honey, I know you want to
make more profits,

289
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,870
but while I'm the chairwoman,

290
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,220
I need you to listen to
what the staff wants.

291
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,950
My goodness. I knew you would say that.

292
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,270
Could you talk to Bi-soo?

293
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,250
You want me to talk to him instead?

294
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,910
He won't come home even after I sold
the house and moved all his belongings.

295
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,900
I think it's because
he feels awkward around you.

296
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,540
Try to convince him.

297
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,900
I told you that selling the house
was a bad idea.

298
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,490
I don't understand why you sold the house

299
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,420
to make a grown-up child come home.

300
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,570
He's our son,
so I want him to live with us.

301
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,850
I want our family to live together.

302
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,110
What did you just do?

303
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,040
Can't you tell? I threw that trash away.

304
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,390
You're unbelievable!

305
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,480
You want your pastry back?

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,830
Then dive into the trashcan. You'll
save me time in getting rid of the trash.

307
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,430
How can you treat a customer like this?

308
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,480
You're a customer?

309
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,840
Did you buy a record?
I didn't sell any to you yet.

310
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,090
Move it if you're not going to sweep it!

311
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,110
You're really something, mister.

312
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,010
People just won't leave me alone.

313
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,990
You did a great job in the makeup event.

314
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,550
So Joo-in...

315
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,860
You're definitely not going to
take that role, right?

316
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,680
-What?
-The studio president called me.

317
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,020
Number Two Pictures?

318
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,880
He offered to apologize
on behalf of Han Bi-soo.

319
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,430
He was on the verge of tears.

320
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,160

I need you to back me up.

[Fire extinguisher]

481
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,290
Mr. Han, what brings you here?

482
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,640
And who are you?

483
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,540
Nice to meet you.
I'm his assistant writer, Jung Jae-hwan.

484
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,600
We're here because...

485
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,900
So you see...

486
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,970
I lost something when I moved out.

487
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,730
Oh, what did you lose?

488
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,010
Something very important.

489
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,070
Indeed!

490
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,710
It's so important that without it,

491
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,680
Mr. Han can't write anything.

492
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,540
-I'll look for it if you describe it.
-You can't find it yourself.

493
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,520
It's very tiny and nearly invisible.
It's very precious.

494
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,860
Only I can detect it.

495
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,500
So what is it?

496
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,310
Excuse me.

497
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,240
-Wait. You can't just--
-Excuse us.

498
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,880
You have to hurry.

499
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,690
I have a meeting with my management team.

500
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,160
Mr. Han!

501
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,390
You can head to your old study
and look for it there.

502
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,960
I'll look for it over here.

503
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,640
Make sure you comb the whole place.

504
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,150
Who is that handsome guy?

505
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,410
Who?

506
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,170
He's an assistant writer.

507
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,020
He came to find something
Han Bi-soo left behind.

508
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,670
He's got such plain looks.

509
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,850
I like that in a guy.

510
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,990
This is my clean room. My clean room.

511
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,410
What is this?

512
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,350
What on earth?

513
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,780
Nice.

514
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,900
Can I go just like this?

515
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,420
You need to hurry to the meeting.

516
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,020
She's very unhappy,
so it won't be easy to soothe her ego.

517
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,360
I'll look over the house.

518
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,170
I'm going to the set right
after I talk to her.

519
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,020
-So you have to come quickly.
-Okay.

520
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,830
-I'll join you right after they leave.
-Okay.

521

Will everything be okay?

Why wouldn't it be?

523
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,240
They're not robbers.

524
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,720
They're writers who you'll be
working with. So get going.

525
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,810
Okay.

526
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,790
Go now.

527
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,140
-You sure?
-It'll be fine!

528
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,570
Why are you so worried about them? Hurry!

That's how it all happened.

We're kind of crazy, right?

533
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,260
No. I completely understand.

534
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,390
A true artist has a crazy streak.

535

Oh, Gwang-ja! I knew you'd understand art.

536
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,370
Yes, I understand lips.

Oh, my. Why did I blurt that out?
I'm so embarrassed.

-Thanks.
-Sure.

Joo-in, everyone is ready on the set.

543
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,150
Okay.

544
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,050
You seem to be very mad at me.

545
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,400
You won't even look at me in the eye.

546
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,010
You used to say your favorite day

547
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,830
is the day of the after-party
for a hit show.

548
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,560
Come together with me.

549
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,790
Are you really going to do
Han Bi-soo's show?

550
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,720
I tried so hard to persuade you
not to do it.

551
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,170
You know how I always
respect your choices.

552
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,720
But Han Bi-soo...

553
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,480
I hate that guy.

554
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,210
He rejected my client three times.

555
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,630
Aren't you upset?

556
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,310
Of course, I'm angry.

557
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,360
Then why him?

558
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,010
There are a bunch of money-raking scripts
you can do instead.

559
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,830
I want to do this.

560
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,330
I know that Han Bi-soo
is a good thriller writer.

561
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,460
But Joo-in,

562
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,530
your contract with KT Cosmetics
might not be renewed.

563
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,940
Rumor has it that Kim Ji-yeon will get it.

564
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,280
But she sprained her arm.

565
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,830
If she signs with them, she'll have to

566
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,350
shoot a whole series of
commercials and pictorials for one season.

567
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,450
Can she handle it?

568
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,870
She's as tough as nails.

569
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,890
She'll do anything to
surpass your popularity.

570
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,910
She'll do a commercial shoot
even in a neck brace.

571
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,070
Once an actor makes up
her mind to do a show, I can't stop that,

572
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,760
but Han Bi-soo's show
will hurt your rosy image.

-behave like this.
-Let go of it.

I was in the zone.

590
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,810
Hurry up. This way.

591
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,159
I can't be interrupted
in the middle like this.

592
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,639
Please hurry.

593
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,850
Good night.

594
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,389
Hide somewhere. Hide!

595
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,380
What? You were still home?
You weren't answering your phone.

596
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,360
Well, you see...

597
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,710
Were you drinking?

598
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:21,000
No. I applied skin lotion
with high alcohol content.

599
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,350
It's like soju.

600
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,250
Something isn't right.

601
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,810
No. Everything is fine.

602
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,990
Move to the side.

603
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,930
They're still here?

604
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,000
No. They left. They left hours ago.

605
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,020
They left.

606
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,330
They left...

607
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,910
Mr. Han?

608
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,150
Hi.

609
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,650
I'm disappointed in you, Gwang-ja.

610
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,580
I entrusted the house to you,
but you let me down.

611
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,930
I met a special guy that I could only
meet once in a lifetime.

612
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,610
So I wasn't thinking straight.

613
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,800
It's my fault.

614
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,110
Scold me. I'm to blame for this.

615
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,670
They both should be praised,
so what is this interrogation?

616
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,720
"Praise"?

617
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,540
Mr. Han, it's rude to overstay.
Especially when the homeowner isn't in.

618
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,810
You don't have to point that out.
I know you own the home.

619
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,080
Legally, this would be called
intrusion of private property.

620
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,930
We're doing this for your sake, you know.

621
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,900
For my sake, you say?

622
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,540
You asked me to finish the script quickly.

623
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,640
So I'm working like crazy to finish it.

624
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,270
Can't you see how hard I'm working?

625
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,910
The faster I finish the script,

626
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,730
the sooner you can make
a decision. It's a win-win.

627
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,420
That strangely makes sense.

628
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
You know I'm a bit special.

629
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,920
So I can only write in a special space.

630
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,320
That space is my old study.

631
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,290
All of my hit shows were written there.

632
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,270
I've never worked anywhere else.
That's the room.

633
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,960
But someone took that away from me.

634
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,270
Now you're making me feel guilty.

635
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,620
I bought this house fair and square.

636
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,770
Gosh, I was nearly finished
writing the script.

637
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,400
I just need to complete a few scenes.

638
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,850
-I was almost finished. I was almost done.
-Yes.

639
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,750
I was almost there.

640
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,740
Does it take long to finish it then?

641
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,130
-Bring the printer. Install it.
-Okay!

642
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,590
Where were you hiding when Joo-in came in?

643
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,610
I was hiding under the dining table.

644
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,300
Oh, your knees must hurt.

645
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,800
They're fine.
I've got sturdy legs, you know.

646
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,750
-You've got everything I like in a guy.
-I see.

647
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,010
But you know...

648
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,080
Gwang-ja, did you really mean
what you said earlier?

649
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,460
What did I say?

650
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,330
You said you couldn't think straight

651
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,020
after meeting a special guy
you could only meet once in a lifetime.

652
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,540
Oh, I blurted out my raw emotions.

653
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,840
Please forget that I said that.

654
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,640
Why? When I heard those words,

655
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,700
my heart started beating faster than

656
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,980
when I was hiding under the table.

657
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,960
Oh, that's crazy.

658
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,930
Oh, gosh.

659
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,580
-Did you finish it?
-Of course.

660
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,970
You finished an entire script
working in this house?

661
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,070
-In just a few hours?
-It was a piece of cake.

662
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,580
Go in and read it.

663
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,890
Okay.

664
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,600
How did you like it?

665
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,570
It's not that bad for a rush job.

666
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,710
It seemed to me that you were impressed.

667
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,850
My, you were peeping?

668
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,420
Peeping? No way.

669
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,350
When the audience is watching
your concert,

670
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,360
do you call that peeping?

671
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,410
Now, what's your opinion?

672
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,420
Was it scary? Or terrifying?

673
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,720
Did it feel like a masterpiece?

674
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,500
If you don't have words to describe it,
you can use body expressions too.

675
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,270
Could you revise all the scenes
from episode one?

676
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,840
All the scenes?

677
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,360
It's a very engrossing script,

678
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,370
-but...
-But what?

679
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,890
The first two episodes
were bloody and gruesome.

680
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,620
But 7 people get killed
in the beginning of episodes 3 and 4.

681
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,860
I was going to kill off 17 characters,
but I trimmed off 10.

682
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,700
I'm a crime thriller writer.

683
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,100
If nobody gets killed,
then what is there to write?

684
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,120
A crime thriller doesn't have to be
bloody all the time.

685
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,310
What if I say no?

686
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,210
Then I can't do the show.

687
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,230
You need me
to get the network to pick it up.

688
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,620
So you're using that as leverage

689
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,060
to get me to rewrite my script?

690
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,240
I want to collaborate with you.

691
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,430
-To make it better.
-You're mistaken.

692
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,850
You're an actor.

693
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,340
You just have to act and follow
the script that the writer wrote.

694
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,980
I can't work like this.

695
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,660
I can't work like this either.

696
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,560
What? I've had it.

697
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,090
How dare an actor propose such a thing?

698
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,620
He said I just need to act
and follow the script?

699
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,510
He thinks I don't have a temper?

700
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,700
He could be a star writer,
but I'm also a top actress!

701
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,310
Gosh, seriously!

702
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,540
Gosh, Oh Joo-in.

703
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,360
I hope she didn't take it literally
when I said I couldn't work like that.

704
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,220
Here's a standing ovation for you,
Mr. Han.

705
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,610
When did you get here?

706
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,630
You're amazing, Mr. Han.

707
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,560
You finished a whole script in a day.

708
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,160
There are some gruesome scenes.

709
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,510
Now we just have to wait for
the network to pick it up, right?

710
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,650
No, we just need to pack and leave.

711
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,700
Pack?

712
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,260
You can go back to your home.

713
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,490
I plan on traveling.

714
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,790
What are you talking about?

715
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,520
Did something happen
between you and Ms. Oh?

716
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,210
No. It's better this way for both of us.

717
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,640
We don't get along.

718
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,500
Hold on. You're going to quit?

719
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,760
What about me?

720
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,270
What about Mr. Yoo?

721
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,800
Mr. Han, you can't let Ms. Oh slip away.

722
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,660
She's the mermaid
that came to give you air

723
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,760
after you were on the verge of drowning.

724
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,380
Yes, I know. But that mermaid
is on a power trip.

725
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,390
I don't think
you're interpreting it correctly.

726
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,200
-Hold on.
-Move it.

727
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,210
Forget the mermaid.

728
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,690
I don't need to be saved.

729
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,590
Yes, how are you feeling, Mom?

730
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,570
The doctor said you were
recovering nicely.

731
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,250
[I'm fine.]

732
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,860
I even participated in
a singing class today.

733
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,870
That must have been fun.

734
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,350
Sing me the song you learned.

735
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,530
Not yet.

736
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,170
I need more practice.

737
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,950
[Do you keep the lights on
in every room in the house?]

738
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,840
When you were alone, you would open

739
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,860
[all the doors
and turn on all the lights.]

740
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,760
No, I don't do that anymore.

741
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,560
[Did anything happen?]

742
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,410
You sound tired.

743
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,160
I was trying hard to make something work.

744
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,720
But I don't think
I conveyed my feelings well.

745
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,320
What is it?

746
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,790
Is it work-related?

747
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,060
I have to decide whether
to join a show or not.

748
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,630
Joo-in, if you really want to do it,
then do it.

749
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,740
And tell the person that
you really want to do it.

750
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,230
I'll think about it.

751
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,460
Get some rest, Mom. Good night.

752
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,430
Okay.

753
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,060
How can you be eating
after ruining everything?

754
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,280
You're cutting off my oxygen supply.

755
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,590
I need to eat somewhere else.

756
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,050
You can't do this to me.

757
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,940
Dae-young, you shouldn't be
doing this to me.

758
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,280
I heard you finished
the script for episode four.

759
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,300
Now the network will pick it up.
But you had to have a tirade?

760
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,950
What good will come out of this
by fighting with Joo-in?

761
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,270
Joo-in has to join the show
if we want to get picked up.

762
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,320
You had no place to stay.

763
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,750
So I leased a traditional house
for you to work on your script.

764
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,560
I've been trying to support you
in every way.

765
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,280
But you do whatever you want. Why?

766
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,040
Since when did I ever get
whatever I wanted?

767
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,520
An actor just needs to focus on acting.

768
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,070
Who does she think she is?

769
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,340
She wants me to revise the script.

770
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,530
-I've been very nice to her, but...
-Hey.

771
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,510
Other actors can't do that to you,
but Joo-in can.

772
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,280
Everyone is avoiding your show
because of the tabloid news.

773
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,590
But who is the only person
who accepted the role?

774
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,400
It's her, Oh Joo-in.

775
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,800
Don't talk to me. Leave.

776
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,060
I want to have dinner.

777
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,190
I'm sorry for yelling.

778
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,740
I apologize for that.

779
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,720
Just consider what I'm going through too.

780
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,960
What's Oh Joo-in's schedule like?

781
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,970
["Red Siren", Episode 4]

782
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,240
[Ms. Oh is attending a test screening.]

783
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,170
[Joo Ye-rin from the same agency
starred in it.]

784
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,520
It's about time, but where is she?

785
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,460
-Oh, my gosh. It's Oh Joo-in.
-It's Oh Joo-in.

786
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:26,470
It's Oh Joo-in!

787
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,480
["Loving Your Enemy"]

788
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,240
-It's Oh Joo-in!
-It's Oh Joo-in.

789
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,170
-Oh, my.
-No way!

790
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,480
She has such a small face.

791
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,280
["Loving Your Enemy"]

792
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,040
She's so adorable.

793
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,760
-She's so pretty!
-Where?

794
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,270
Hello, everyone.

795
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,040
-I congratulate you on your hit show.
-You're so pretty!

796
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:44,740
-You're the queen of romantic comedies.
-You're so pretty.

797
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,920
You're a sweetheart
in every role you take.

798
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,990
I guess that's what makes you special.

799
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,840
I think most viewers can't wait

800
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,270
to see your next show.

801
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,460
So tell us about your next project.

802
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,010
You're so pretty!

803
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,700
It's a show that fits me perfectly.

804
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,130
Which means it's a romantic comedy?

805
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,330
-Thank you for the interview.
-Can you look here?

806
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,510
-Please look straight at the camera.
-She's moving.

807
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,400
Wait. My gosh.

808
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,820
It'd be awkward for me to leave right now.

809
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,940
She's dozing off after ruining my life.

810
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,750
Oh, gosh. What should I do?

811
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,940
Excuse me.

812
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,710
Why I am so sleepy?

813
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,650
Maybe because I stayed up
reading his script.

814
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,770
[Oh, right. Han Bi-soo
went to the test screening to see you.]

815
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,740
[Gwang-ja]

816
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,670
[He probably wants to talk you into
doing the show.]

817
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,010
[It's from a trustable source.]

818
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,140
Should I just go?

819
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,610
No.

820
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,720
I came all the way here
so I should say something to her.

821
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,250
You can't leave because
you don't want to lose

822
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,770
your lead actress, right?

823
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:39,980
You saw me on the red carpet.

824
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,750
Everyone's attention was on me.

825
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,520
I'm a star.

826
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,070
A sparkling star.

827
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,220
Han Bi-soo. Without me,

828
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,070
you're a falling star
with a sullied reputation.

829
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,210
I'm a star, and you're a falling star.

830
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,490
Not just any star. But a falling one.

831
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,670
-Why you! Will you stop it!
-A falling one!

832
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,190
You really came here?

833
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,720
You were waiting in front of
the ladies' room to meet me?

834
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,740
Yes. No way. It's just a coincidence.

835
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,220
Me being at this movie theatre
and right here are a coincidence.

836
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,990
Whether it's a coincidence or not,
it's good that you're here.

837
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,090
We need to have a talk, you know.

838
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,770
I think you made yourself clear earlier

839
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,240
-on the red carpet.
-What?

840
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,800
You said you found a project
that fits you.

841
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,270
A romantic comedy as usual.

842
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,130
-I wasn't referring to that--
-You must not want to work with me.

843
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,600
I know that. But that was a bit mean.

844
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,570
In front of the cameras,
you say one thing.

845
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,170
You don't care what you say
in front of the cameras, do you?

846
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,820
-You came here to--
-Guess you got a lot of offers.

847
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,630
While you were telling me

848
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,640
to kill fewer people in my script,

849
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,240
you were weighing which project to pick?

850
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,000
I thought you were serious with my script,

851
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,100
so I came here to try to
convince you to team up.

852
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,790
But that was all an act too?

853
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,410
Oh, Reporter Lee. You startled me.

854
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,010
Since when were you standing there?

855
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,390
I love this conversation.

856
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,740
Great setting too.

857
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,910
You won't

858
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,100
write an article about this, will you?

859
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,950
I'm sorry, but I need to write
every detail about this as it's my job.

860
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,040
Focus on doing one job.

861
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,690
If you're trying to win points
or trying to threaten us,

862
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,340
just pick one. I can't tell if you're
a beggar or a punk.

863
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,400
-What?
-Now, now.

864
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,040
Can we talk later?

865
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,740
This article could be great
with the right headline.

866
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,840
Readers love it when they
hear trouble brewing.

867
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,720
What a way to make a living.

868
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,200
You'll also smell a dirty restroom
in that sleazy article.

869
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,550
So make sure you have a strong stomach.

870
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,870
Wait... Mr. Lee...

871
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,710
Now you got what you wanted.

872
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,360
A tabloid article and a canceled show.

873
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,630
I didn't come to let this happen.

874
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,310
Let's begin the interview.

875
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,200
[A guy like him]

876
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,200
["Assault rumors, Producer Dropped out"]

877
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,210
[is a writer?]

878
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,210
["'Red Siren' in Trouble"]

879
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,020
[He assaults people,
so he knows his material.]

880
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,020
[Is Writer Han Bi-soo's Career over
after 'Red Siren' Sinks?"]

881
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,610
[His show should be canceled.]

882
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,210
[Comments]

883
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,050
[I'm never watching his shows again.]

884
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,040
[Now you got what you wanted.]

885
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,430
A tabloid article and a canceled show.

886
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,000
That's not what I meant.

887
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,890
[You had no place to stay.
So I leased a traditional house]

888
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,700
for you to work on your script.

889
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,880
I've been trying to support you
in every way.

890
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,980
But you do whatever you want. Why?

891
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:17,460
[Oh Joo-in]

892
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,940
[Are you sleeping?]

893
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:27,200
[Oh Joo-in]

894
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,670
[I'll talk to the reporter
so give me his number.]

895
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,820
Can I make things right by
getting down on my knees now?

896
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,890
[Mr. Han.]

897
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,020
Mr. Han...

898
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,390
Mr. Han.

899
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:57,520
Excuse me.

900
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,870
Did you sleep well?

901
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,140
-But you need to get up now.
-What is it?

902
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,360
-You need to get up.
-What?

903
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,800
There's an article you have to read.

904
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,440
Mr. Han!

905
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,120
Why are you in a good mood?

906
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,840
So you haven't read it?

907
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,780
What were you doing
not checking the Internet?

908
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,080
All right.

909
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,350
Han Bi-soo.

910
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,300
Ta-da. Here. Take a look.

911
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,560
["Exclusive! Oh Joo-in Joins
Han Bi-soo's Show as a Lead"]

912
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,710
What is this?

913
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:29,320
["Exclusive! Oh Joo-in Joins
Han Bi-soo's Show as a Lead"]

914
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,930
Mr. Han.

915
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,130
You're amazing, Mr. Han. Really.

916
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,410
-What is going on?
-Impressive.

917
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,540
-Yes.
[-What is going on?]

918
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,510
This isn't what you said to me last night.

919
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,150
Come to my place.

920
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,960
I don't want reporters to see us.

921
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,760
You have a knack in surprising people.

922
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:13,210
You could just say this is great news.

923
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,640
You came to the test screening
to meet me, didn't you?

924
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,070
Gwang-ja told me.

925
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,160
Oh, Jae-hwan, that punk.

926
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,640
I did it all for your sake, you know.

927
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,610
I met with the reporter
and did an interview.

928
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,100
And praised your script.

929
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,820
You really didn't have to do
this project. So why did you?

930
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,910
Is that important?

931
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,390
-What's important is that we're a team.
-That's true.

932
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,200
Just one condition.
Don't interrupt me when I'm writing.

933
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:40,210
Sure.

934
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,250
-What?
-Let me rent that room.

935
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,860
-Starting from today.
-Who says I'll let you?

936
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,600
-I can't allow that.
-I'll pour all my energy into this.

937
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,120
I'm going to pour my soul into it
as if it's my last work.

938
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,050
You will?

939
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,270
I got you to join my show as the lead,

940
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,740
so I have to return the favor.

941
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,250
Now I'm feeling the pressure.

942
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,430
There's an ulterior motive, right?

943
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,110
No, no motive at all.

944
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,340
There's only one thing I want.

945
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,520
And is that...

946
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,240
If you get writer's block,
you can come by and use the room.

947
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,880
Not sometimes. 24-hour access.

948
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,850
That means you'll be living here.

949
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,950
Why is that the focus of this discussion?

950
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,970
I'm not asking for a place to live.

951
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,020
I just want to work here.

952
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,320
That's the same thing.

953
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,910
I'll lock myself in that room.

954
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,640
I won't step out of it.

955
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,110
-That's not convincing enough.
-For Oh Joo-in,

956
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,090
I'll pour my heart and soul
into the script.

957
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,600
That's not moving me either.

958
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,800
You saw yourself that I can only

959
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,780
write in this house.

960
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,420
I want to write.

961
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,690
But there's one condition.

962
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,830
You have to follow it exactly.

00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,570
While you live in my home,

965
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,980
you'll call me "master",
and I'll call you "writer".

966
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,790
Why are you the master?

967
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,480
Because it rhymes with my name. Joo-in.

968
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,010
Master... Master?

969
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,980
Is that even right?

970
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,240
Fine then.

971
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,840
Let's just call each other
"Writer" and "Joo-in".

972
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,820
I can't read the lines of a script written

973
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,790
by a writer who puts on airs
and acts special.

974
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,100
These are extreme terms.

975
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:45,660
I'm not comfortable with these terms.

976
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,430
Oh, well. Then let's scrap the agreement.

977
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,280
I feel like I'm signing a slave contract.

978
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,370
I'll tear it up then.

979
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,540
Fine.

980
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,580
Master.

981
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,470
I didn't hear you.

982
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,100
I didn't catch what you just said.

983
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,530
I didn't hear you right.

984
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,610
Master.

985
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,340
One more time.

986
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:11,700
Master! Master! Satisfied?

987
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,920
Give that to me.
