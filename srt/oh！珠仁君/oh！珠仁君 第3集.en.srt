Why did she insist on meeting here?

163
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,530
She's playing psychological games.

164
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,970
Have a seat.

165
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,360
I could hear you muttering
under your breath.

166
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,410
Oh, Ms. Kim. Well...

167
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,630
My gosh.

168
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,700
How much has Han Bi-soo written so far?

169
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,290
He finished the draft for episode 4.

170
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,310
And he's making changes to it
that Ms. Oh requested.

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,880
Indeed. Joo-in is on the verge of
losing her cosmetic contract

172
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,190
because she chose to appear
in Han Bi-soo's TV show.

173
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,250
-I see.
-I'm sure you're aware that the network

174
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,900
won't pick up the show
if Joo-in decides not to do it.

175
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,080
Yes, I'm very aware of that.

176
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,190
I promise you that the show will be a hit.

[Oh Joo-in]

178
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,420
Ms. Oh will be able to
boost her career too.

179
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,230
That has to happen no matter what.

180
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,460
Our agency will fully cooperate
with your studio.

181
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,570
Thank you so much, Ms. Kim.

182
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,910
Joo-in is our agency's top star,
and she's more than just that.

183
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,960
Right.

184
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,770
She's the first actor
I signed to our agency.

185
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,500
She was 18 when I scouted her.

186
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,700
Ever since then, I have always sought
what is best for her career.

187
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,570
I understand how much
she means to you and your agency.

188
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,690
I'll do my best in helping Bi-soo
to write his best work.

189
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,050
Let's try to make this a success.

190
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,440
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

191
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,140
At last, it feels like we're a team.

192
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,720
-Oh, Ms. Kim.
-Oh, gosh.

193
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,460
-That's enough.
-Oh, Ms. Kim.

194
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,740
She's got a lot of energy.

195
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,470
She could kill someone with her punch.

196
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,290
I tried to be thoughtful.

197
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,110
Why can't he say sorry or thank you?
He's got to fix that.

What a jerk. He's antisocial!

199
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,720
Maybe I'll punch him
the next time he acts like that.

200
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,140
She clearly wants to kick me.

201
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,350
But why is an actress like her
taking up boxing?

202
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,460
Darn it!

203
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,330
Hey, you've been in there for 30 minutes.

204
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,330
Life was better when I was living alone.

205
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,650
What?

206
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,810
Darn it.

-Why did you turn around?
-What is it?

215
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,120
Put on some clothes.

216
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,800
How can I wear this? It's soaking wet.

217

-Don't look.
-Who would want to look?

218
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,580
Then why are you looking?

Keep your eyes covered.
Now walk to your room.

Don't peek, okay?

Could you hurry to your room?

224

I'm watching to see if you're peeking.

225

I think you sprained your back.

226
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,280
You need to exercise. Your muscles
get tight if you sit around all day.

Don't mind me. I'm fine.

For how long are you
not going to tell Bi-soo?

You should at least let him know.

What good would it be to tell him?

I'll delay telling him
as long as possible.

then you lack creativity.

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,219
might be uncomfortable.

482
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,159
Writer Han.

483
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,820
You have another favor to ask?

484
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,000
Changing this room won't be enough.

485
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,310
I need to buy
some extra toiletries for my mom.

486
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,340
My mom won't be suspicious
about this room,

487
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,110
but you have personal belongings
in the living room and the bathroom.

488
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,989
All right. I'll go buy some boxes
to pack my belongings.

489
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,760
And I'll see you back here
after you buy some toiletries.

490
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,150
Okay.

491
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,500
Once we part here,
don't act like you know me.

492
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,110
Who are you? Why are you talking to me?

493
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,719
All right. 1, 2...

494
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
Oh Joo-in!

495
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,670
I saw a moving truck a few days ago.

496
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,480
I can't believe a top star
is living in this neighborhood.

497
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,510
I never imagined I'd see you
right before my eyes.

498
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,640
It's an honor.

499
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,790
-Please come often.
-Oh, I will.

500
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,930
I would love to get her autograph.

501
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,720
Oh, you're back.

502
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,780
Are you going to laminate more notes?

503
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,620
-No.
-Someone in your family

504
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,390
has Alzheimer's, right?

505
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,150
That must be tough.

506
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,080
A long illness can wear down a family.

507
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,980
My friend's dad is ill,
and it's really hard caring for him.

508
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,910
Sometimes, he wishes
he could forget about his dad.

509
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,340
It's a big headache.

510
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,190
I don't recall asking you to tell me.

511
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,130
Why do I have to listen
about your friend's situation?

512
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,940
I didn't mean it like that.

513
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,720
How could he consider
his dad's illness as a headache?

514
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,250
I know a person who acts
the exact opposite to him.

515
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,530
-Writer Han, you were impressive.
-What?

516
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,480
I didn't hear you. Say it again.

517
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,690
You said it was wrong to consider
a family illness as a headache.

518
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,680
I felt uncomfortable
when the storeowner said that.

519
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,320
I was uncomfortable with it.
That's why I spoke up.

520
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,970
Thanks for laminating
the notes on the fridge.

521
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,990
I laminated them because
the frayed edges were bothering me.

522
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,870
If something bothers you,
it's good for me, isn't it?

523
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,600
Let me carry some of your stuff for you.

524
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,450
That's okay. I'm fine.

525
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,320
We can't let people see us
walking together.

526
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,600
I'll pretend we met by coincidence.
It's a piece of cake.

527
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,290
I'll tell them that you're a writer friend
and that we met by coincidence.

528
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,590
Maybe not.

529
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,280
I'll say that we're very close.

530
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,840
Very close?

531
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,860
Don't get so close. It's too warm.

532
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,210
It's too warm?

533
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,810
On a chilly night like this?

534
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,210
Wait for me.

535
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,330
Wait for me.

536
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,420
What are you doing?

537
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,050
You didn't notice I was back?

538
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,590
Oh, hi. You seem to be in a good mood.

539
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,930
You're smiling.

540
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,030
I am?

541
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,920
Because it's a full moon.

542
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,830
-What are those pills for?
-I have indigestion.

543
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,930
You've been acting strange lately.

544
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,420
You sold off the house
that Bi-soo was living in.

545
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,310
Then you tell me you're resigning.

546
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,670
I want to retire and enjoy life.

547
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,080
I want to smell something else
than sanitized hospital hallways.

548
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,820
Like flowers and
freshly-baked bread in the morning.

549
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,740
-Before it's too late.
-Why would it be too late?

550
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,130
We've still got a lot of years left.

551
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,120
Anyway, if you want to retire,
then I'll do my best to run the hospital.

552
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,350
I won't disappoint you.
I'll work hard in my new job.

553
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,990
So I need your full support.

554
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,230
You always achieve
what you set your mind on doing.

555
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,180
Recommending you to
the hospital board is all I can do.

556
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,450
You'll be able to get the job on your own.

557
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,370
Closing doors and drawers
is a habit of yours.

558
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,010
I thought you were doing that
out of anger.

559
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,870
The door exists to be closed.

560
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,760
No, it exists to be opened.

561
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,180
Absolutely not.

562
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,290
They exist to divide spaces,
so why would you leave them open?

563
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,740
I even caught you
closing the door to my room.

564
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,060
Why are you so obsessed
with closing doors?

565
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,970
When I see a door half-open,
I can't stop staring at it.

566
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,280
It bothers me, and I get
this uncontrollable urge to close it.

567
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,270
It's very distracting.

568
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,140
That must be stressful.

569
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,930

What now? You have another favor?

571
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,140
No.

572
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,960
I suddenly told you
that my mom was coming over,

573
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,560
and you didn't complain at all...

574
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,340
I don't need a thank you.

575
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,460
I don't help people
just because they ask for it.

576
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,190
I am doing this because I want to.

577
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,080
All right.

578
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,190
Thanks to you, we're done.

Focus on doing your job, okay?

598
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,390

You even have a record player.

It would be nice to listen to a record

I bought it for that purpose.

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,260
It's great.

640
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,310
I didn't have time to unpack.

641
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,300
So I read books and scripts here.

642
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,750
-Do you remember that time?
-Of course.

643
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,870
It feels like your dad could be here
writing at any minute.

644
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,480
I miss him.

645
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,290
Mom.

646
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,280
You worked so hard for this, Joo-in.

647
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,810
Thanks.

648
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,130
Why are you only eating vegetables?

649
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:23,640
My tastes have changed.

650
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,950
You don't crave any foods

651
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,800
because you've tasted
almost all fine cuisines?

652
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,060
Perhaps.

653
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,800
When will you tell me where you're living?

654
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,560
Why do you need to know?

655
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,250
I'll clean up the place
and organize your things.

656
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,930
Then I'll cook something for you there.

657
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,620
I'm curious to know what it looks like.

658
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,600
You know, do the things
that other moms do.

659
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,820
You're bored with running a hospital?

660
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,260
Doing ordinary stuff
that moms do doesn't fit you.

661
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,480
Are you seeing anyone?

662
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,630
I don't have time for that.
I'm too busy writing scripts.

663
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,930
Make time to date someone.

664
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:57,240
You made a lot of money.

665
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,040
I'll get around to it.

666
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,300
Stop nagging me.

667
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,660
I won't tell you to get married,

668
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,920
but you should date a girl.

669
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,110
-I'm going home, Mom.
-No, enjoy your food.

670
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,120
I won't hang out with you
if you keep this up.

671
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,340
Okay, okay.

672
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,580
-Start dating.
-Come on.

673
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,520
It feels like
I'm back at the nursing home.

674
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:18,830
You really don't have to.

675
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,470
I like doing this for you.

676
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,540
The oils smell nice,
and I'm able to be a dutiful daughter.

677
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,180
It makes me happy.

call us at any hour, and we'll help.]

681

I'm Park Gun-ho, and I've been
appointed as your aide.

682
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,250
Nice to meet you.
My sister told me a lot about you.

683
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,230
This is a phone you can use in Korea.

684
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,450
Thanks.

685
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,800

[Joo-in]

687
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,720
Hey, Yu-jin. It's been so long
since you last called me.

688
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,860
[You're even busier than me.]

689
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,460
How is Paris?

690
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,690
We visited the Eiffel Tower
and Montmartre together.

691
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,040
[Is it still nice there?]

692
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,900
Paris has the Louvre,
Eiffel Tower, and Montmartre,

693
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,500
but you're missing.

694
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,550
So it's no fun.

695
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,490
I'm so sorry that I missed
your exhibition.

696
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,510
I couldn't find time in my schedule.

697
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,480
That's okay.

698
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,740
Don't lie. It's not okay.

699
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,970
By the way, something great happened.

700
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,900
I bought my old home and moved in there.

701
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,830
Really?

702
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,640
I'm so happy for you.

703
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,530
You always wanted to live there again.

704
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,560
It took me 10 years to return here.

705
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,860
[Good job.]

706
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,090
It must've been tough,
but you never showed it.

707
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,440
You don't have to
hide your feelings around me.

708
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,530
Be yourself, okay?

709
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,710
I won't be annoyed.

710
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,440
Wait. It sounds like you're
in the neighborhood.

711
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,790
Did it sound like that?

712
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,140
I guess I miss Seoul a lot.

713
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,500
Then come back soon. Paris is so far.

714
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,850
I miss you, Yu-jin.

715
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,000
I miss you too, Joo-in.

716
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,550
When did you get here?
You have writer's block again?

717
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,980
No, I just came.

718
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,090
I see. Just because.

719
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,320
The girl I had a crush on in college
came to see me out of the blue.

720
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,330
What?

721
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,040
She was cute back then,
but now she looks so elegant.

722
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,700
Did she have a crush on you too?

723
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,560
I don't know.

724
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,210
I think she just considered me
as a funny college senior.

725
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,160
But it was so nice to meet someone
from my college days.

726
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,610
It brought back a flood of memories.
I felt young again.

727
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,620
Like I was in my 20s.

728
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,400
-You don't look young at all.
-Do you have to say that?

729
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,210
Stop talking about the girl
you had a crush on.

730
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,100
Any new records?

731
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,410
-Show them to me.
-You're so cold.

732
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,550
They're over there.

733
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,310

734

Don't ever write a script about romance.

736
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,190
Squash, green onion,

737
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:49,250
chili peppers, mushrooms.

738
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,320
Slice the chili peppers.

739
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,430
Split the mushrooms.

740
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,310
Slice the squash sideways.

741
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:07,940
Slice the onions into thick slices.

742
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,440
Make the tofu into cubes.

743
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,020
They're not that bad.

744
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,630
I bought them from a guy
who had no space to keep them.

745

There are a few gems in there.

Isn't this album a killer

747
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,590
Don't say that word.

748
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,990
I can't find a better word
than "sick" to describe it.

749
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,310
Stop it. I have to get it out of my head.

750

Are you getting stressed over someone?

751
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,020
Is someone giving you problems?

00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,910
-To the point you want to kill them?
-Yes.

753
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,090
What?

754
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,700
Now she can't kill him herself.

755
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,130
She'll have to get someone else
to do the deed.

What are you talking about?

757
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:59,050
I can make her the killer
instead of the doctor.

758
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,200
It won't create any problems in the story.

No, that sounds like a doctor's name.
