An old friend I hadn't met
in 40 years came to see me.

You mean your best friend
from high school?

113
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:43,900
Yes.

114
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,300
You told me you were hurt
after she cut off all contact with you.

115
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,430
But I forgave her when I saw her.
She was a dear friend.

116
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,450
It must have felt great.

117
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,250
You missed her for so long
and got to see her.

118
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,540
And we haven't slept in the same bed
like this for a long time.

119
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,760
It's a wonderful day.

120
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,300
I like how you smell.

121
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,170
Does she look okay to you?

122
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,060
Would you be able to do it
after something like this?

123
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm going to do it.

124
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,020
We made sure there wouldn't be any leaks.

125
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,580
The sponsor of the award show
was KT Cosmetics,

126
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,520
which Joo-in is under contract with.

127
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,360
So I asked them to make sure
it's not reported.

128
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,100
And Mr. Han's name will not be mentioned
in any relation to this incident.

129
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,070
I see.

130
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,930
You took care of this matter very swiftly.

131
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,450
I learned something new.
Please be my mentor.

132
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,890
Oh, I'm flattered.

133
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,540
I thought Bi-soo and Joo-in
were not getting along.

134
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,520
I can't believe he rescued her.

135
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,260
I think they're a team now. Like us.

136
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,210
I guess so.

137
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,190
I think I was mistaken about Mr. Han.

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,830
I thought he was a self-centered guy.

139
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,110
He's not. Bi-soo is a great guy.

140
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,010
Many studios have tried to poach him
by offering him big advances,

141
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,620
but he's stayed
with my studio for 10 years.

142
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,980
I'm sure Bi-soo cares a lot about Joo-in
since they're on the same team.

143
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,050
I hope we can meet next time
under better circumstances.

144
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,110
We'll be seeing each other a lot, I think.

145
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,040

This is it.

152
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,730
I brought you coffee.

154

How have you been, Ms. Yoon?

155
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,590
I've been well.

156
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,780
It looks you didn't get much sleep.

157
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,170
I stayed up working on a script.

158
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,300
-Did you get some sleep?
-Yes.

159
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,890
You only brought coffee for us?

160
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,280
What about you?

161
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,180
I had a cup of coffee earlier.

162
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,880
While I was drinking it,
I was thinking of someone.

163
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,350

You came here because you're worried
about something, didn't you?

321
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,000
You can read people quickly.

322
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,060
I wonder if that's why
you can give good advice.

323
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,540
You're right.

324
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,700
In exchange for my counseling,
you only brought a can of coffee?

325
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,290
What is it? Go ahead and tell me.

326
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,870
I need to tell someone something
very important.

327
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,150
I'm not sure if I should though.

328
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,570
Should I just keep it to myself?

329
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,290
And who is this someone?

330
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,550
My son.

331
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,520
You talked about your son last time.

332
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,200
I see that you care a lot about him.

333
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,440
Every mom cares about her child.

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,930
But he's even more special to me.

335
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,750
Even if you don't tell him,
are you sure he won't be able to find out?

336
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,430
He'll eventually find out.

337
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,980
In that case, just tell him.

338
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,660
I would if I were you.

339
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,960
From my experience,

340
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,830
telling people the truth
much later doesn't work out well.

341
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,040
Don't steal a glance at me.

342
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,390
I'm not stealing a glance.

343
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,920
How could I not notice a tall guy
in the kitchen?

344
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,870
I'm so forgetful.

345
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,970
I need to pull an all-nighter.

346
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,860
If I drink this,
I'd probably fall asleep like a baby.

347
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,800
What a waste. I guess I'll have
to pour it down the sink.

348
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,020
Don't pour it down the sink.

349
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,840
Don't waste it. Let me drink it.

350
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,680
-You will?
-Yes.

351
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,330
Well, it's better than throwing it away.

352
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,390
Drink it all up.
Don't waste a single drop.

353
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,900
Okay.

354

You got milk on yourself like a kid.

355
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,020
I can wipe it off afterward.

356
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,080
It bothers me.

357
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,410
If something bothers you,
it's good for me, isn't it?

358
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,600
-You know...
-Yes?

359
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,700
I came up with a word to use
instead of thanks.

360
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,790
What is it?

361
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,600
-Thank you very much.
-Now you're joking with me.

362
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,410
I knew you wouldn't like it.

363
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,220
I don't like it.

364
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,230
-Writer Han.
-What?

365
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,710
I like it.

366

Living in the same space like this.

367
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,840
I think we're getting along fine.

368
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,320
We're very different from each other,

369
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,340
but somehow, we make a good team.

370
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,840
I'm also pleasantly surprised.

371
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,070
Thanks for the...

372
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,550
I like it.

373
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,260
You went through an ordeal,
but it's over now.

374
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,170

You're not going to tell me
where you're staying?

I'm not asking you to move back with us.

But then again, you won't be able to
sell the place I'm living in.

No, you don't.

411
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,490
I could call the moving company you hired.

Why would you call them?

Don't call them.

Don't call them.

What are you doing here?

You said you had a meeting.
What are you doing here?

427

Call Ms. Oh. I'd like to speak to

Oh, that?

458

together with Joo-in.

00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,410
What are you talking about?
Of course, not.

463
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,220
Why are you so defensive?

464

I'm not!

466
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,000
Then you don't like Ms. Oh at all?

467
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,820
I've never had any thoughts about her.

468
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,850
You always make yourself clear
on every matter.

469
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,290
But why can't you give me
a straight answer this time?

470
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,520
What?

471
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,690
Hi, Ms. Oh.

472
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,750
Hello...

473
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,220
Turn around and leave.

474
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,560
What brings you here?

475
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,350
You rented a room to Bi-soo
because he can only work in this space?

476
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,810
Yes. I saw with my own eyes
that he can only write his scripts here.

477
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,140
That was the sole reason
you rented it to him?

478
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,490
No personal feelings whatsoever?

479
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,620
Gosh.

480
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,080
Renting the room to him
seemed to be the best way

481
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,260
to get the TV scripts finished on time.

482
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,840
There are no personal feelings
involved at all.

483
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,840
Same with me.

484
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,910
I absolutely have no personal feelings.

485
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,850
So what are you planning to do now?

486
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,330
I'll be here for three months,
at the most.

487
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,970
Once I'm finished, I'll be out of here.

488
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,230
There's nothing to worry about.

489
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,700
You're only thinking about yourself.

490
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,940
If the tabloids were to find out
about this,

491
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,540
it would damage Ms. Oh's reputation.

492
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,890
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

493
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,990
I came without calling ahead.

494
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,840
That's all right.

495
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,960
What are we going to do now?

496
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,930
What do you mean?

497
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,270
She is against this arrangement.

498
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,510
I don't care if she's against it.
It's my decision.

499
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,690
Why are you getting mad at me?

500
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,460
You're assuming that I will have to leave

501
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,270
because of my mom, right?

502
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,870
That's not my point.
I'm worried about this whole situation.

503
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,170
Forget it then.

504
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,650
Now that your mom knows about this,

505
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,590
I was going to propose that you
tell her that you have it under control.

506
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,590
So please don't make assumptions
until you know what I'm thinking first.

507
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,490
You're going out?

508
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,840
I have a dinner appointment.

509
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,780
Is it an important one?

510
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,880
We're dealing with an emergency.
Maybe you should stay in.

511
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,980
I scheduled it days ago. It's with Yu-jin.

512
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,130
But you see him often.

513
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,070
We need to find a solution
to this problem on our hands.

514
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,470
It's irresponsible
to just leave like this.

515
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,750
I'll be back.

516
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,780
Jae-hwan, is your work hard these days?

517
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,260
You have dark circles under your eyes.

518
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,150
I could buy you a traditional tonic
if you'd like.

519
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,510
You're my tonic, Gwang-ja.

520
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,290
Looking at you gives me strength.

521
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,980
I know how to pick the right guy.

522
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,620
What kind of show would you like to write?

523
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,890
Psycho thrillers like Writer Han?

524
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,640
No. I'd like to write
a romantic show to die for.

525
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,660
About a fateful love.

526
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,560
Love? Like what we have?

527
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,460
The heroine in the first show I create

528
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,100
will be named Gwang-ja.

529
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,930
Jae-hwan, I'm so touched.

530
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,700
I've always been working
in the shadows of celebrities.

531
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,970
But thanks to you, I'll be the lead once.

532
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,650
Thanks for the thought.

533
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,800
It's not just a thought. I'm a doer.

534
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,600
So just wait and see.

535
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,540
-What will we do about those dark circles?
-Are they very dark?

536
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,180
You need to eat more salmon.

537
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,200
What is it?

538
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,260
Are you worrying about something?

539
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,650
Oh, it's nothing.

540
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,830
I would have told you already
if I had a problem.

541
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,050
I guess so.

542
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,989
-Joo-in.
-Yes?

543
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,050
When will you invite me over
for a housewarming party?

544
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,690
A housewarming party?

545
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,010
You asked me last time why I didn't
ask to go inside your home.

546
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,530
I said that?

547
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,900
Could you wait a little longer?
Is that okay?

548
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,580
Sure.

549
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,060
Thanks. Let's eat.

550
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,560
It's good.

551
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,850
Are you awake?

552
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,120
What on earth? What are you doing here?

553
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,930
My dear, Writer Han.

554
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,940
What was that?

555
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,020
Am I exhausted or something?

556
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,890
Not again!

557
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,950
[You have writer's block because
you're thinking about me, aren't you?]

558
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,470
[Start writing.]

559
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,490
Attention! Attention!

560
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,620
No.

561
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,870
Let's focus.

562
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,720
I can't. I'm so distracted.

563
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,730
You poor thing.

564
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,050
You'll keep thinking about me
no matter what you do.

565
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,700
Please stop.

566
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,760
Writer Han, don't go anywhere.

567
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,450
You can't run away.

568
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,210
Enough!

569
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,300
Am I losing my mind?

570
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,680
What are you doing?

571
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,820
[Nabom Nursing Home]

572
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,710
Hey, I'm here.

573
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,730
You seem to have a lot of
free time for a hospital chairwoman.

574
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,670
This place also has doctors.
It's not much different.

575
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,870
I'd rather come here
since I can see a friend.

576
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,810
Doesn't it get stuffy
to stay here all day?

577
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,360
It's not that bad.

578
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,330
And I can't go anywhere by myself.

579
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,220
You can if you go with me.

580
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,250
Let's go somewhere today.

581
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,720
Where?

582
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,080
He's Chang-gyu? The guy from church?

583
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,360
Yes, you came along with me
to attend his college festival once.

584
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,800
He offered me a drink
and said I would be fine.

585
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,740
That was my first time drinking alcohol.

586
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,680
-I think it was dongdongju wine.
-Correct.

587
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,410
I haven't changed at all, have I?
I look the same, right?

588
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,720
No, you don't look the same.

589
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,110
But I see traces of your younger self.

590
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,920
Nice to meet you again, Chang-gyu.

591
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,620
I should've introduced you two sooner
if I had known you'd be delighted to meet.

592
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,310
Can I invite my daughter here?

593
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,070
She doesn't live that far away.

594
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,630
Sure. I'd like to
meet your daughter, Jung-hwa.

595
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,880
Oh, Joo-in.

596
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,590
I'm near your home.
Can you come by here if you have the time?

597
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,230
You're nearby?

598
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,500
I could've driven you myself
if you had called.

599
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,850
I'm with some friends.

600
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,910
I want to introduce you to them.

601
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
[It'd make me feel proud.]

602
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,990
Just Record? Okay. I'll be there soon.

603
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,400
Why did you mention Just Record
while talking to your mom?

604
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,930
Aren't you friends with
the owner of that store?

605
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,530
-Yes.
-My mom says she's there

606
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,590
with her friends. She wants me to drop by.

607
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,070
Why would your mom go there though?

608
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,170
Her daughter seems to be very famous.

609
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,520
But she won't tell what she does.

610
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,710
If I tell you her name, you would know.

611
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,390
I'll introduce her when she's here.

612
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,020
Now I'm curious.

613
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,300
-She must be really famous.
-I know, right?

614
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,200
-Hi, Joo-in.
-Hey.

615
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,260
Mr. Han is with you too.

616
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,000
Bi-soo. What are you doing here?

617
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,730
What on earth?

618
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,930
Jung-hwa, how do you know my son?

619
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,490
What did you say?

620
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,010
Bi-soo is your son, Hae-jin?

621
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,250
Chang-gyu, how do you know my son?

622
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,350
Now this is complicated.

623
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,460
Did you know, Jung-hwa?

624
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,470
About what?

625
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,380
That they live in the same house.

626
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,440
-Yes.
-You knew they were living together?

627
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
But you didn't say anything?

628
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,770
Seems like they're discussing something.

629
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,800
This is happening because of me.

630
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,360
It's not all your fault.

631
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,460
I'm also involved.

632
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,600
I think they finished talking.

633
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,430
So you two can leave.

634
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,450
The adults have something to discuss.

635
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,250
Blame me and not anyone else.

636
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,240
Joo-in didn't do anything wrong.
I insisted that she rent that room out.

637
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,510
I understand how you feel. So you can go.

638
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,320
All right. We'll go then.

639
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,620
Mom, I'll call you later.

640
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,210
Sure. Okay.

641
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,830
What are you up to?

642
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,630
I think my mom is really mad at us.

643
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,860
If she demands that you leave,
where do you plan on going?

644
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm not going anywhere.

645
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm going to stay here till the end.

646
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,810
What?

647
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,350
I need to write my scripts.

648
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,330
I can't finish them anywhere else.
So I'm staying put.

649
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,520
That is true.

650
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,470
Until the lease expires,
I'm not going to let anyone force me out.

651
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,330
That means you'll have to
persuade your mom.

652
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,830
What's your decision, Mom?

653
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,950
Tell me now if you made up your mind.
I can't wait until tomorrow.

654
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,000
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

655
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,750
-She wants to meet you tomorrow?
-Yes.

656
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,180
If my mom tries to move
all my belongings out while I'm not here,

657
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,660
don't let her do it. Call me right away.

658
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,840
All right.

659
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,650
What is she planning to say?
Why wait until tomorrow?

660
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,600
I shouldn't be sitting still.
I need to talk to someone first.

661
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,090
Where are you going?

662
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,450
Really?

663
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,130
You don't have anything to tell me?
You really have nothing to tell me?

664
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,650
No, I don't.

665
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,910
I'm going to meet my mom tomorrow.

666
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,470
So if you know anything, please tell me.

667
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,480
Like a preview of what's coming.

668
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,870
Let me do that for you.

669
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,890
Why are you badgering me?

670
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,320
You're worried that you can't finish
the script if you move out?

671
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,090
That's not the issue.

672
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,580
Wait a minute.

673
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,230
There's something more important
to you than writing scripts?

674
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,030
Gosh.

675
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,480
Just tell me what you heard.

676
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,350
What did my mom and Joo-in's mom say?

677
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:43,300
I don't want to betray
Hae-jin and Jung-hwa's trust,

678
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,080
but to save you from your predicament,

679
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,350
I'll tell you what I know.

680
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,570
All right!

681
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,360
[What? A blind date?]

682
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,710
Did you really say that?

683
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,800
How can I go on a blind date when
I'm in this arrangement with Writer Han?

684
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,480
What does that matter?

685
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,260
Are you in some kind of
relationship with him?

686
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,480
[Is that why you don't want to
go on a blind date?]

687
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,680
I didn't mean it that way.

688
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,290
Someone I know wants to
introduce him to you.

689
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,680
He's a fine young man.

690
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,840
If you don't like it,
then you can just leave after saying hi.

691
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,270
Okay, Mom.

692
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,490
Since you're asking me to go, I'll do it.

693
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,770
But I'm just going to say hi.

694
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:37,990
Okay.

695
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,400
I hope they would go out with each other.

696
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,790
Me too. I like Joo-in a lot.

697
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,930
Because she's my daughter?

698
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,110
Oh, there's more to it than that.

699
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,590
I think my son likes her.

700
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,930
I like Bi-soo too.

701
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,090
Since they're living together,
let's find out if they like each other.

702
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,570
You're all dressed up.

703
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,330
You're even wearing a necktie.

704
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,550
Yes.

705
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,400
I need to impress someone today.

706
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,210
You said you were seeing your mom though.

707
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,020
Does this suit look bad? Should I change?

708
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,450
Oh, no, no.

709
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,440
She'll be impressed with how you look.

710
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,300
I hope she will.

711
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,400
What will you say to her?

712
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,090
Well...

713
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,490
She's going to demand
that you leave this house immediately.

714
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,460
You have to persuade her
and change her mind.

715
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,950
I'll try my best to tell her how I feel.

716
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,150
I'll see you later.

717
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,530
Later?

718
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,080
I mean I'll see you when I come home.

719
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,480
Oh, sure. Try to convince your mom.

720
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,870
Right.

721
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,050
We confirmed that Ms. Oh
and Mr. Han Bi-soo are living together.

722
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,810
How did you learn of that?

723
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,870
I didn't ask you to do
a background check on her.

724
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,520
I got orders from above
to check if the rumors were true

725
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,460
because it could damage our company image.

726
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,760
-My sister asked you?
-I'm sorry

727
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,450
that I didn't tell you
about the orders I got.

728
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,390
So the rumor is true then?

729
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,570
Yes, we've checked it.

730
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,340
And we have another problem.

731
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,630
A reporter is staking out the house.

732
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,160
-Who is he?
-His name is Lee Sun-mok.

733
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,980
Ms. Oh had an exclusive interview
with his paper not too long ago.

734
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,740
[Closed]

735
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,660
Why did she choose this place
for the blind date?

736
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,060
Writer Han?

737
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,820
-Hi.
-What's going on?

738
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,760
I found out that my mom and yours

739
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,700
set us up on a date.

740
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,760
I can't believe my mom did this.

741
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,940
And your mother didn't show up?

742
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,250
I talked to her over the phone.

743
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,390
She told me to think of it as a blind date

744
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,950
and then to call her afterward
to tell her how it went.

745
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,270
So that's why my mom said
this was a blind date.

746
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,700
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Bi-soo.

747
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,380
Are you trying to be funny?

748
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,770
We're on a blind date, after all.

749
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:44,300
I introduced myself.
So I'd like to get your name.

750
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,500
My name is Oh Joo-in.

751
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,130
Nice to meet you.

752
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,490
What kind of person was your dad?

753
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,540
What?

754
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,730
Aren't we going too fast
with the personal questions?

755
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,450
Am I?

756
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,510
Why is your first question about my dad?

757
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,580
Well, I was told I kind of resemble him.

758
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,190
And you seem to have fond memories of him.

759
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:11,760
So I wondered if I share
anything common with him.

760
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,050
My dad

761
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,610
always wanted to do things
together with my mom.

762
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,010
He'd wash the dishes with her
and go grocery shopping with her.

763
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,160
He would play records and dance with Mom.

764
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,980
And he told us
that he loved us very often.

765
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,990
Not just to my mom but also to me.

766
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,540
He said it was important to
say those words a lot.

767
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,380
They shouldn't be used sparingly.

768
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,540
So we're not similar at all.

769
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,100
He's totally different.

770
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,990
No, you are similar to him.

771
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,570
You're a peculiar person, Joo-in.

772
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,090
-I am?
-Yes.

773
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,450
I can't live together with other people
in the same house.

774
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,710
Somehow, you make me feel like
I've never lived alone before.

775
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,820
I would say
that's because you're very quick to adapt.

776
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,720
No. Writing was all I needed in life.

777
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,030
I never got bored with it.

778
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,110
But after you entered my life,
I find myself bored when I'm alone.

779
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,630
I didn't know I could get so bored
when you're not around.

780
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,040
Aren't you busy as is with your scripts?

781
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,980
I don't think you'd
have time to get bored.

782
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,020
-You think so?
-I'm joking.

783
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,820
I heard that you're working on
an article about Ms. Oh.

784
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,970
Yes, I am writing an article.

785
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,650
So Ms. Oh and Writer Han Bi-soo are--

786
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,170
You should choose your words carefully.

787
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,450
Ms. Oh is the main spokesmodel
for KT Cosmetics.

788
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,650
I'm sure you're aware that we can
press charges for defamation.

789
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,460
It won't be a false article.

790
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,430
I don't write articles
based on false assumptions.

791
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,910
What if your reporting doesn't
represent the actual circumstances?

792
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,520
I'm dating Ms. Oh.

793
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,620
So you're aware that
you're attractive, right?

794
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:26,410
Yes. That's how I got recruited.

795
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,890
Why did you choose an acting career?

796
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,380
Because you can make a lot of money
if you become famous.

797
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,410
And I needed money
to buy back our old family house.

798
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:41,030
I also thought I'd find happiness
when I'm acting.

799
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,800
Acting can bring happiness?

800
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,410
Because you can do things that are
not permitted in the real world.

801
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,090
Could you give me an example?

802
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,070
Like acting in a role where
I wake up late and skip breakfast,

803
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,170
but the character playing my mom
insists I have a bite.

804
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,770
I get snippy because I'm late.

805
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,680
I then do a quick job in polishing
Dad's shoes to get allowance money.

806
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:09,300
I also lie that
Mom didn't give me an allowance.

807
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:14,290
When I return home,
I plop down on the sofa.

808
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:19,670
Then Mom and Dad enter the set
and tell me to wash my hands for dinner.

809
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,200
I wanted to play a role like that.

810
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,260
Did you get those kinds of roles?

811
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:30,970
Yes, I did. But when the shoot is over,
you realize it's not real.

812
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,290
That's when you feel empty.

813
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,890
Then try doing it for real.

814
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,070
You can complain about your day to me.

815
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,730
And I'll nag you from time to time.
Maybe I'll nag you often.

816
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:46,680
If you want, I'll give you allowance money
when you shine my shoes.

817
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,590
How about we listen to
a song while we're here?

818
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,980
What kind of song?

819
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,010
Well, this brings back some old memories.
When I was in high school,

820
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,750
I was walking by
and heard a nice melody out front.

821
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,520
So I stood in front of the speaker,
listening to it.

822
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,050
The record store owner came out
and handed me the record.

823
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,460
I listened to it in the listening room.

824
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,100
For hours.

825
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,750
The owner recalled seeing me crying

826
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,240
while I was in that room.

827
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,980
Which song was it?

828
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:54,840
When the artist recorded this album,
he was very sick.

829
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,240
He knew he only had a few months to live.

830
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,400
Actually,

831
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,750
I had something I wanted to tell you
when I see you today.

832
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:48,600
I always thought blind dates
were a waste of time.

833
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:51,410
But on my way here to see you,

834
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,520
I was excited.

835
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,880
At first, when I rented the room
in your house,

836
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,610
I had to do it to finish my scripts.

837
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,480
But now because of you,
I don't want to leave the house.

838
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:15,900
So what I'm trying to say is that

839
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,030
whenever I see a door open,

840
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,640
I get the urge to close it.

841
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,630
But when you were locked in the closet,

842
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,910
it was my first time

843
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,320
to go crazy trying to open it.

844
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,770
I

845
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,970
like you, Joo-in.

846
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,830
Could you give me
some time to think about it?

847
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,090
When I commit myself to a relationship,
I stay committed.

848
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:23,430
Due to my career,
I can't make a quick decision.

849
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,360
When I'm certain that I like you too,

850
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,890
I'll confess my feelings to you first.

851
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,550
Could you give me
some time to think about it?

852
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,610
Why is Director Jung here?

853
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,560
Yu-jin. I'll go out, so wait there.

854
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,860
[No. I'd like to come in and talk.]

855
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,750
[The three of us including Mr. Han.]

856
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,040
-Yu-jin.
-I'll just say it here.

857
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,770
An article will be released tomorrow.

858
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,450
What kind of article?

859
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,090
About you two living together.

860
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,200
Someone else knows besides me.

861
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,060
-Who else knows?
-Reporter Lee Sun-mok.

862
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,000
He stalked out your house for days.

863
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,860
"Exclusive! Oh Joo-in is Living
with Writer Han Bi-soo".

864
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,880
That was going to be
the headline of his article.

865
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,830
-But I can stop it.
-How?

866
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,890
I told him that his facts were wrong.

867
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,610
I said I was dating Joo-in.

868
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,800
Yu-jin, that's not true though.

869
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,740
The facts don't matter.
People want to believe what they want.

870
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,900
Most people would rather believe
that you're dating a high school friend

871
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,300
rather than the fact
that you're living with Mr. Han.

872
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,530
It's my duty to protect your image.
That comes first.

873
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,140
Fine. I understand
how deeply you care about Joo-in.

874
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,660
I'm curious about one thing.

875
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,340
How did you find out?

876
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,620
That we're living in the same house
and about that reporter.

877
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,770
Joo-in is our company's spokesmodel.

878
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,000
There were rumors going around,
and we had to check if they were true.

879
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,610
So it won't hurt her image
that she's dating you?

880
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,720
Later on, we can say that we broke up.

881
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,220
And reports about dating are better
than a celebrity living with a writer.

882
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,540
So it's up to you, Joo-in.

883
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,350
If you wish, I'll change the story
before it runs tomorrow.

884
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,620
Think about it.

885
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,170
Wait.

886
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,290
I've decided. I'll follow your plan.

887
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,600
Let's run the story that we're dating.

888
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:24,600
[Oh! Master]
