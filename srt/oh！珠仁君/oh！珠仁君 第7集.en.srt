5
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,010
I knew the day would come

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,780
when my mom
wouldn't be able to recognize me.

7
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,910
But I thought that day would be far away.

8
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,990
Even if she didn't recognize other people,

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,630
I thought she'd

10
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,789
be able to remember me.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,730
I told myself that.

12

I couldn't handle the day

13

that would happen to her.

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,820
It looks like you can handle it
without a problem.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,850
Your mother is so thoughtful.

16
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,830
She assigned you a different role
to keep things interesting.

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,060
Today, she thought you were
a student of her husband.

18
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,640
I wonder what role
she'll give you next time.

19
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,970
Try to go along with it.

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,160
You're an actress. That's what you do.

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,009
You can do this.

22

-It's nothing to cry about.
-You're right.

23
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,509
I'm relieved that I'm an actress.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,050
I'm confident in playing a daughter role.

25
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,530
And I could play other roles too.

26
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,970
I'll be able to keep her amused.

27
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,360
Thanks to her,
you'll improve as an actress.

Even if the day comes

29
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,250
when Mom will completely forget who I am,
I'll remember her.

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,560
You're her daughter.
Nobody can change that.

Writer Han, do you think I can handle it?

33

You're already doing a fine job.

34
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,450
You're doing a fine job.

35
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,660
-That was a La Bise.
-What?

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,360
It's the French form of greeting.
You know, La Bise.

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,560
Is this how the French do it?

38
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,590
If you're very close friends in France,
they kiss like that.

39
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,160
For real. I saw French friends kissing

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,140
each other on the cheeks
with my own two eyes.

41
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,390
I don't understand why you'd
use La Bise now though.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,740
It's a sleep-tight kiss.

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,310
But it's daytime.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,670
You can sleep at any hour if you want.

45

When you're tired, you take naps.

Oh, I'm suddenly thirsty.

Of course I want to do it.

I don't think anyone would be interested.

What did we do last year on my birthday?

104
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,490

On Valentine's Day last year!

112

I was in my study at my house.

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,290
And what were you doing?

114
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,270
I had pulled all-nighters
for three days straight,

115
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,830
trying to finish the draft script
for the hit show, "Doctor Psycho".

116
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,310
Nobody gave you any Valentine's chocolate?

117
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,870
I thought Valentine's Day was
a day when you write scripts

118
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,970
and take an aspirin to cure your headache.

119
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,330
I'll give you chocolate
on Valentine's from now on.

120
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,360
If that's what you want,
I guess I can't reject it.

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
Memories lose their power.

122

What happened to me earlier?

124
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,090
We went to Chang-gyu's record store,
and you took a nap.

125
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,350
You can tell that

126
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,250
something is amiss by just looking
at your child's expression.

127
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,850
That look on their faces.

128
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,900
I think I did something wrong
and upset Joo-in.

129
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,790
You didn't do anything wrong.

Hae-jin.

131
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,600
All right. You need to know
what your daughter underwent.

132
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,260
She's probably very upset.

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,429
No way.

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,210
You couldn't recognize Joo-in.

What can I do?

136
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,580
I don't care if I forget other things.

137
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,900
I prayed to the heavens to let me
never forget Joo-in's face.

138

Don't hold any grudges.
You're not the only one suffering.

Other people face hardships too.

140
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,290
People keep it to themselves,
so you never hear about it.

141

do the interview tomorrow?

146

I have to. It's something
I have to get over with.

that he announced he was dating you.

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,360
[Open]

163
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,070
This is about a month's supply of candy.

164
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,090
So what is it that you want
to talk about today?

165
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,340
-I came to talk about my son.
-What?

166
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,380
Thanks for being
such a good friend to my son.

167
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,930
Don't ask me to keep treating him nicely.
I've been nice to him so far.

168
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,900
-Right.
-Have you gotten soft with age?

169
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,920
That's ironic.
Your name literally means "strong".

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,570
Bi-soo might act tough, but he's not.

171
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,500
I already know that.

172
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,490
I first met him when he was 18.

173
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,470
I remember that he was very sad.

174
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,290
He cried in the listening room
while listening to a song.

175
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,860
He cried?

176
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,880
I guess he got dumped by a girlfriend.

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,640
He was inconsolable.

178
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,030
I asked him what was the matter,
but he wouldn't tell me.

179
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,640
It's the first time I heard that.

180
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,040
You two really are close.

181
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,900
Have a candy.

182
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,410
How do I look?

183
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,090
I couldn't get any sleep.

184
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,740
-You look fine.
-Thanks for the compliment.

185
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,220
There's something I want for my birthday.

186
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,360
What is it? Ask for anything.

187
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,800
Instead of being my fake girlfriend,
be my real girlfriend.

188
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,410
How does that work?

189
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,680
Just be my real girlfriend.

190
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,620
No matter who you meet or where you go,

191
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,300
think of me as your boyfriend.

192
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,310
No more faking it.

193
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,770
All right. Got it.

194
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,220
What on earth?

195
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,780
What's wrong with me?

196
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,860
I heard that you knew
each other for 10 years.

197
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,050
When did that change?

198
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,600
It just happened suddenly.

199
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,920
I realized I loved her while I was
working on an art exhibit in Paris.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,570
I found myself drawing her
in all of my paintings.

201
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,300
The person I wanted to be with
was in Seoul.

202
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,240
It didn't feel right to be
so far in Paris all by myself.

203
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,890
That's when I knew for sure.

204
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,330
Being next to Joo-in
was where I should be.

205
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,140
When did you find out that
Yu-jin was in love with you?

206
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,650
I had no idea.

207
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,100
He often said that he misses me
and that I look pretty.

208
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,540
But that's how it was all the time,
so I didn't notice he had changed.

209
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,600
Of course, Joo-in didn't know at first.

210
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
I was always too late

211
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,090
in realizing my feelings
and telling her how I feel toward her.

212
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,250
Now hold that pose.

213
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,070
You two look great.

214
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,730
Could you tell me when you thought of
Yu-jin as a romantic partner?

215
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,400
Back in high school,
I thought Yu-jin knew me pretty well.

216
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,480
When we made our
relationship public recently,

217
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,460
I realized he knew me well

218
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,190
because he was in love with me.

219
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,180
How does that feel?
Going from a friend to a boyfriend.

220
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,680
Before, he was a friend
I could tell my personal secrets.

221
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,380
Now, he's my boyfriend
and part of my personal life.

222
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,110
I like both sides.

223
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,930
[I first met him when he was 18.]

224
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,080
[I remember that he was very sad.]

225
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,520
[He cried in the listening room
while listening to a song.]

226
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,650
What are you doing?

227
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,470
-What? You didn't call.
-You look surprised.

228
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,830
Can't I come over when I want to see you?

229
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,040
Your dad isn't home at this hour,
you know.

230
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,270
What should we do?

231
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,030
Is there anything you want to do, Mom?

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,570
When you're having a tough time,
you keep it to yourself, don't you?

233
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,530
I heard the first time you went
to Just Record, you cried there.

234
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,830
Gosh, Chang-gyu! Why did he tell you that?

235
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,140
You hardly ever cry in front of me.

236
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,530
What made you cry there?
In front of a stranger.

237
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,700
That was a long time ago.
I hardly remember it.

238
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,340
Just look after your health, Mom.

239
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,980
What?

240
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,160
You retired.

241
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,440
If you want to travel and have fun,
you need to be healthy.

242
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,700
Bi-soo, I'm thinking about checking
into Jung-hwa's nursing home.

243
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,100
A nursing home?

244
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,000
Why?

245
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,620
I have chronic gastritis.
I was too busy to get it treated.

246
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,140
Can't you get outpatient care for it?

247
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,010
It's better that way.
You also know many specialists.

248
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,790
It's not serious.
I just need to follow a strict diet.

249
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,470
It's nothing to worry about.
I want to be near Jung-hwa.

250
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,030
Why didn't you ever show any symptoms?

251
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,410
How was I supposed to know

252
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,770
that you had chronic gastritis
when you look healthy to me?

253
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,240
Why are you yelling? I'm sick, I said.

254
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,950
You have to get better. Okay?

255
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,800
That's why I'm going there.
Of course, I will.

256
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,510
I want to have a homemade meal, Mom.

257
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,540
Here you go.

258
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,540
You were craving seaweed soup? That's it?

259
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,180
What's wrong with seaweed soup?

260
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,980
Will you make seaweed soup
for me in October too?

261
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,819
You forgot my birthday?

262
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,890
How could I forget your birthday?
I gave birth to you.

263
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,010
I'll make you better seaweed soup then.

264
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,450
That's a promise.

265
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,860
-How's the show script coming along?
-It's fine.

266
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,900
I added a subplot
based on your suggestion.

267
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,290
My suggestion?

268
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,890
Boy meets girl, girl meets boy.
That kind of stuff.

269
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,910
-You said you wanted that.
-Yes, I do.

270
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,460
Put in a lot of funny scenes.

271
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,350
So that I can laugh
when I watch your show.

272
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,570
Just wait for six more months.

273
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,090
That's when the show will be aired.
So laugh all you want.

274
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,170
-Do you know what I wish for?
-What's your wish?

275
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,360
To see you have good thoughts,

276
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,560
laugh a lot, fall in love,
and be loved back.

277
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,370
My goodness.

278
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,850
It's perfect.

279
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,950
I'm here to save your life.

280
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,800
I told you who I was.

281
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,530
The person who would save my life?

282
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,090
You're going to die.

283
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,940
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

284
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,570
I'm glad you were born. Happy birthday.

285
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,810
I also think it was a good thing
that I was born.

286
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,700
-Thanks.
-For what?

287
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,130
For solving my problems.

288
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,990
So did you like my birthday gift?

289
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,950
Loved it.

290
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,550
I was pretty happy.

291
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,320
Wish it was for real though.

292
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,300
It was real.

293
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,680
The interview I gave

294
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,210
and the things I said. They're true.

295
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,260
You said that you were always too late
in realizing your feelings.

296
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,360
Well, I don't want to make
the same mistake.

297
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,630
That's why I'm thinking
carefully about us.

298
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,360
Don't make me wait too long.

299
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,790
Consider how long we've been friends
and how long I've waited.

300
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,010
Okay.

301
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,030
Let's eat.

302
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,130
Thanks.

303
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,020
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

304
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,250
Where's my birthday cake?

305
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,070
Can't you treat my mom here instead
of her going to a nursing home?

306
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,340
Of course, I told her that I'd treat her.

307
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,100
But she wouldn't listen.

308
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,660
Doctor, you can make her listen.

309
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,940
Your mom told me

310
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,090
that she doesn't want to waste her time
on a small chance of being cured.

311
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,690
She chose to go to a nursing home

312
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,670
to at least monitor her condition.

313
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,560
How much longer does she have to live?

314
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,150
Nobody knows for sure.

315
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,500
Will she be able to live
for more than six months?

316
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,560
-I can't guarantee that.
-But you're a doctor.

317
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,910
You can't make a medical prediction?

318
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,860
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,440
I should apologize.

320
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,920
I lost it for a second.

321
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,860
There's nothing I can do

322
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,670
to save my mom.

323
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,310
Bi-soo.

324
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,400
Let your mom decide how she wants to spend
her remaining time.

325
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,860
It's her precious time, after all.

326
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,920
Hi, Writer Han.

327
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,800
Would you like to drink beer together?

328
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,190
No, thanks.

329
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,330
Is there anything you want to talk about?

330
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,910
[Let your mom decide
how she wants to spend]

331
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,010
[her remaining time.]

332
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,920
[It's her precious time, after all.]

333
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,460
What are you doing, Mom?

334
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,190
You don't sound like your usual self.

335
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,080
You're so perceptive.

336
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,950
Writer Han is in a depressed mood.
It's a little concerning.

337
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,510
[I think I know why he's like that.]

338
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,160
His mom is moving to my nursing home.
We'll be sharing a room.

339
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,770
Writer Han's mom? Why?

340
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,150
Chronic gastritis?

341
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,110
So that's why he's in a bad mood.

342
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,800
Bi-soo is probably worried about his mom.

343
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,960
I remember the time you left to
stay at the nursing home.

344
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,650
As I was leaving after dropping you off,
I felt it was all my fault.

345
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,460
I was ridden with guilt.

346
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,190
Joo-in, don't feel guilty.

347
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,640
In life, lots of things happen
that have nothing to do with you.

348
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,960
All right.

349
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,730
I'll give him some advice later.

350
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,460
Sleep well, Mom.

351
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,740
Drink a lot of fluids
and don't forget your meds.

352
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,390
Okay. I'll stop.

353
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,820
Sleep tight.

354
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,490
You're writing the scripts at a good pace.

355
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,710
And the plot is good.

356
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,280
You came all the way here
just to show me this?

357
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,590
Mr. Han, what are you doing?

358
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,410
I hope you'll grant me this favor.

359
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,550
Wait a minute. This is unsettling.

360
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,240
Did you do something crazy again?

361
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,240
Chief, please move up
the show premiere to an earlier date.

362
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,250
What are you talking about
out of the blue?

363
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,270
I'll work my butt off
to finish the scripts.

364
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,630
So please move up the premiere date.

365
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,780
Could you move it up by three months?

366
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,130
You know that's not possible.

367
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,410
What are your reasons
for making such a tough request?

368
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,910
There's someone I want to show my TV show.

369
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,530
But it's uncertain

370
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,840
if she'll be alive till then.

371
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,390
I didn't see your name
on the chemotherapy list.

372
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,120
Are you giving up?

373
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,150
I came by before I move
into the nursing home.

374
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,080
Do you recall anything that
happened to Bi-soo when he was 18?

375
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,250
What?

376
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,160
Bi-soo's grades fell sharply then.

377
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,010
He also stopped talking to you.

378
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,890
Although you didn't have
a warm bond with him,

379
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,120
he still looked up to you.

380
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,470
That's true. It's all my fault.

381
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,560
What?

382
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,520
When he was 18, he was under a lot
of pressure due to college admissions.

383
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,160
I wasn't there for him during that time.

384
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,610
I was busy at the time with VIP surgeries.

385
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,880
That's it?

386
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,360
Bi-soo said he was going
through a tough time.

387
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,340
But I didn't make myself available.

388
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,370
I think I disappointed him.

389
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,680
Someone seems to have hurt him.

390
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,860
Can't you try to be more nurturing?
It's not too late.

391
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,850
Even if it's hard for you,
try to be a better dad.

392
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,740
Why aren't you wearing your gloves?

393
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,310
I forgot.

394
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm so busy.

395
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,500
It's your fault that my life got
complicated. Why did you say that?

396
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,850
What did I say?

397
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,740
I didn't do anything.

398
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,180
You told my mom that I cried.
Now she's worried.

399
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,820
She's overreacting.

400
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,300
Young men cry sometimes.

401
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
The record is skipping.

402
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,650
How are you able to laugh often?

403
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,370
Tell me your secret.

404
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,690
You do it effortlessly without thinking.

405
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,040
Laughing easily like me isn't easy.

406
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,470
But there's a method to it.

407
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,820
What's your method?

408
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,670
It keeps skipping.

409
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,760
Surprise.

410
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,090
Oh, my goodness.

411
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,330
Look at this room.

412
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,400
I decorated this room without telling you.

413
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,460
-Do you like it?
-I love it!

414
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,390
It's like a hotel suite.

415
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,340
I think I'll remember every moment

416
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,860
I spend here with you.

417
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,120
That's the plan.

418
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,780
Think of this as a hotel room
on a vacation trip....

419
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,720
Where is this place? Hawaii?

420
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,780
Jung-hwa.

421
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,990
I need my meds.

422
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,270
Why did you lie to me that
you had chronic gastritis?

423
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,740
I didn't expect you
to figure it out so fast.

424
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,590
I wanted to enjoy our time together
without any worry.

425
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,890
How did this happen to us?

426
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,090
I'm sick and so are you.

427
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,790
We're not competing
to be sicker or anything.

428
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,110
But I'd say I won today
in the illness category.

429
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,610
I could never beat you in a competition.

430
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,140
But I thought I was winning
in that category.

431
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,270
Jung-hwa, I always come out on top.

432
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,560
Hello, Joo-in.

433
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,160
How have you been?

434
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,810
Bi-soo is in the listening room.

435
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,530
With practice, you can laugh often?

436
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,670
My gosh.

437
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,250
-Hi, there, Writer Han.
-What's up?

438
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,690
How did you know I would be here?

439
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,670
I had a feeling that I'd find you here.

440
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,400
You know everything about me, I see.

441
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,850
I have to host a radio show tomorrow.

442
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,460
So? You came to brag about it?

443
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,780
I have to give advice to listeners.
But the scheduled guest can't come.

444
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,670
So?

445
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,770
I'm a writer in high demand, you know.

446
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,450
But you're asking me
to be the backup guest?

447
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,260
Then I'll ask Yu-jin if he can do it.

448
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,150
Wait!

449
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,710
Since you came all the way here to ask me,

450
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,630
I'll make an exception and do the show.

451
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,190
I knew you'd say yes.

452
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,110
You didn't have to come here to ask.

453
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,000
You could have just given me a call.

454
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,810
-I was concerned.
-About what?

455
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,970
Does it worry you a lot that your mom
moved to a nursing home?

456
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,540
How did you find out?

457
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,810
Your mom's roommate is my mom.

458
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,160
My mom will be fine.

459
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,690
Of course. She's a strong woman.

460
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,800
It's you whom I'm worried about.

461
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,360
If you ever need any help, just tell me.

462
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,760
My mom has been there
much longer, you know.

463
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,040
The first night here is the hardest.

464
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,850
It's not hard at all.

465
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,820
After two days, you'll finally

466
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,390
be able to settle in
and feel like this is my place.

467
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,140
If you can't sleep,
then don't try so hard.

468
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,590
You can sleep tomorrow or two days later.

469
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:24,930
You're right. I'll eventually sleep
for good at some point.

470
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,990
I smell warm milk.

471
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,160
I guess you remembered the time
I gave you warm milk.

472
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,790
That was for me?

473
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,980
I thought you were going to
pour it down the sink.

474
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,540
Oh, that's right.

475
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,560
-Guess I can't drink this.
-Why not?

476
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,630
I have to read
the radio show script tonight.

477
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,810
But if I drink this, I'll fall asleep.

478
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,790
I hate to waste this,
but I'll have to throw it out.

479
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,100
Don't pour it down the sink.

Thanks for agreeing to do it.

When I married you,
I wanted to be your protector.

640
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,040
But I don't think I did that well.

because of my illness.

00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,340
Bi-soo still doesn't know?

645
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:18,940
No. Like I told you before,
don't tell him.

646
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,860
I don't want him to go through the shock.

It's time for Expert Advice.

651
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,390
I have a guest with me.

652
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,290
He's a TV writer who has
worked on TV thrillers.

653
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,150
-An award-winning writer.
-Yes, that's me.

I'm a TV show writer, Han Bi-soo.

655

It's your first time being on
a radio show. How does it feel?

656
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,850
I hardly ever get nervous.

657
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,710
But being on the show with you
is making me nervous.

658
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:08,160
Well, having you on the show
puts my mind at ease.

Let's take a song request from Writer Han
before we have our first caller.

660
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,560
My Love, Stay with Me by Kim Hyun-sik.

It's Writer Han's favorite song.
Here it is.

662
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,730
When we get our first caller,
you have to be very careful.

663
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,750
You have a bad image
for having a testy personality.

664
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,720
So you need to change people's minds.

665
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,820
I can't be self-conscious
about that constantly.

666
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,510
It's nice to have people
see your good side.

667
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,610
Why do you think I have a good side?

668
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,630
I only think about myself.
My feelings are important.

669
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,390
I do what I want.

670

That's also who you are.

671
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,320
But you're an authentic person.

672
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,480
Most people act in a certain way
for a reason.

673
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,250
But you're not calculating like that.

674
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,160
You really care when you talk to someone.

675
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,270
So that makes it special.

676
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,650
You're mistaken.

677

I'm nice to you for a reason.

678
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,660
What?

679
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,020
You know that reason yourself. The reason.

to a fellow employee at work.]

[But she has a male friend.]

[I think she likes me, but when I see
how she treats her guy friend,]

[I think she's in a serious relationship.]

She's just checking out the pool of guys.

689
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,280
So quit hanging out with her.

690
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,380
You didn't ask her out yet, did you?

691
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,660
She could be thinking about
whom to choose between you two.

Excuse me.

693
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,940
I take back what I said earlier.

694
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,930
Take a wait-and-see approach
since she's not dating anyone.

695
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,660
You said you think she likes you, right?

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,890
[-Yes.]
-You also think about her

697
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,320
and want to be with her?

698
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,680
You get jealous and angry thinking about
what she's doing with her guy friend?

699
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,290
[Yes. Do you have a similar experience?]

700
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,590
Oh, I actually do.

701
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,550
I felt like I really

702
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,450
liked her.

703
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,970
If I'm not certain about a relationship,
I don't pursue it.

704
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,000
But I found myself breaking my own rules.

705
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,560
I don't understand what I'm doing,

706
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,210
but I can't hold back these feelings.

707
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,890
So I have to see it to the end

708
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,390
because these feelings won't stop.

709
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:17,160
So was that helpful advice to you?

710
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,140
[Yes. I'm going to take Mr. Han's advice
and go with it.]

711
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,570
Writer Han,
you were giving serious advice.

712
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,760
Any last words?

713
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,610
I'm glad I came on the show today.

714
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,070
-Ms. Oh, I hope we'll work together fine.
-What?

715
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,470
We're working on the same TV show.

716
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,860
Oh, the TV show.

717
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,300
Of course.

718
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,680
This is my first time hosting
a live radio show.

719
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,500
Every second and minute meant a lot to me.

720
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,210
By tomorrow, I'm sure I'll miss this show.

721
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:59,410
So I'm your one-day radio host,
Oh Joo-in on "Romantic Night".

you.

724
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,920
You were terrific.

725
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,900
It was great.
The closing line was perfect.

726
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,510
You came up with that line.
So you have to like it.

727
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,780
You must feel lonely or else
how could you come up with it?

728
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,690
I don't have time to feel lonely
because I live with someone.

729
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,000
Joo-in, I don't feel like going home.

730
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,510
-What?
-What?

731
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,070
I don't feel like going into
an empty house.

732
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,180
-I know that feeling.
-Wait, what?

00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,650
I'll stay over at your place tonight.

734
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,080
-Sure.
-Why?

735
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,110
Why aren't you asking for my permission?

736
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,540
I need your permission too?

737
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,890
No. I'm the homeowner.

738
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,650
Writer Han is just a tenant.

739
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,460
So don't let him bother you. Stay over.

740
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,640
Okay.

741
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,990
Come on, Writer Han.

742
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,490
I could wear anything.
This looks expensive.

743
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,390
I'm going to throw it away afterward.
I don't wear clothes someone else wore.

744
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,110
It fits me perfectly.

745
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,490
-Joo-in.
-Joo-in.

746

What's going on? You got up
and spoke at the same time.

747
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,410
I think Mr. Han is all right,
but he doesn't seem to like me.

748

Joo-in, come here.

Want to play?

750
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,650
I told you about this game.
Do you still play it?

751
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,160
I played it while in Paris.

752
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,170
And I would think about you.

753
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,530
I don't play kid's games. So have fun.

754

I'm going to work on the script.

755
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,230
You're still here?

756
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,990
Don't distract me.

757
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,220
We'll be quiet.

Wow. This is amazing.

You're still good at this.

760
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,520
That wasn't too loud, right?

00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,400
He went to get changed.

771
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,170
What is it?

772
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,110
-It's the script.
-Let's practice the lines.

773
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,510
I'll read the guy's lines,
and you'll read yours.

774
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,370
-Right now?
-Sit down.

775
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,130
How can I become your lover?

776
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,010
It's simple. Just look the way you are.

777
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,240
Your eyes seem to flicker with anger,

778
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,760
but they are deep and calming.

779
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,950
"It's like the world has frozen
when you look at me."

780
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,500
I like that about you.

781
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,740
-"Stop. Don't say another word."
-"Why?"

782
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,310
I might kiss you.

783
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,560
What was that?

784
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,000
You're making me jealous
by looking at him like that.

785
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,280
-Continue with the next line.
-What are you doing?

786
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,120
We're practicing lines.

787
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,380
Continue.

788
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,760
"I don't like guys like Gene.
He repulses me."

789
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,660
"He looks good-looking and cute,
but he's not my type. I don't like him."

790
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,550
But who is Gene?

791
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,280
I didn't see this name
on the character list.

792
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,960
He's a new character.

793
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,700
Anyway, your expression was perfect
when you said you were repulsed.

794
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,380
Now continue.

795

"He's just a friend.
I don't feel attracted to him at all."

00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,770
-"He's in the friend zone."
-Mr. Han, it's interesting,

797
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,570
but do you think viewers
will like this scene?

798
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,760
Leave it to the professional writer
to make that call.

799
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,210
But do you know the viewers, Mr. Jeong?
Are you an expert?

800
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,570
I'll stop right here. I need a break.

801
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,210
Oh, it was getting fun.
I wanted to hear more.

802
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,360
But there's a mistake in this script.

803
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,960
My script is flawless.

804
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,810
You described me as being cute.

805
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,700
But you're a cuter guy than me.

806
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,380
What?

807
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,390
Should I add Gene to the show
to spite him?

808
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,260
I would like you to be more honest,
Mr. Jeong.

809
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,960
Okay. Go first. I wanted to talk to you.

810
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,700
You don't want to go into an empty home?
But you live alone.

811
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,900
-It's the truth.
-Just tell her you want to be with her.

812
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,160
On the radio show earlier.

813
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,590
What you said to the caller was
your true feelings, right?

814
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,150
It was meant for Joo-in to hear, right?

815
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,250
You're not as dumb as I thought.

816
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,730
As you know, I like Joo-in a lot.

817
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,540
I'm not going to let you
steal her from me.

818
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,140
Joo-in isn't an object that you steal.

819
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,080
It's up to Joo-in on whom she'll choose.

820
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,940
Mr. Han, memories are stronger
than you think.

821
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,890
They might not appear so at first,
but when people are under stress,

822
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,780
the power of memories becomes a factor.

823
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,900
I'm so sleepy.

824
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,300
You can sleep in the guest room
if you're tired.

825
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,280
The guest room.

826
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,590
You're not asleep?

827
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,080
I'm going to bed.

828
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,480
I just need some water.

829
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,190
We can't allow a special guest
to sleep on the couch.

830
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,590
I'll have to carry him to the guest room.

831
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,820
All right.

832
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,560
My gosh, this is...

833
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,780
I'm so sorry.

834
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,760
My goodness.

835
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,930
What are you doing?

836
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,080
You were sleeping
in a cramped position on the couch.

837
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,770
-And so?
-I got concerned.

838
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,490
I was trying to move you, but then...

839
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,800
You don't want to throw your back
by sleeping like that.

840
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,270
Were you really concerned?

841
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,580
Don't argue with me.

842
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,730
A couch isn't a bed, Mr. Jeong.

843
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,780
Go sleep in the guest room.

844
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,250
Leave that here.

845
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,980
Go. Hurry and go in.

846
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,920
Sleep on a bed. On a comfortable bed.

847
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,460
Why is he there?

848
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,570
Where did the blanket go?

849
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,290
What are you two doing?

850
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,270
I guess I'll go to bed.

851
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,700
It's time for you to be honest too.

852
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,300
What just happened?

853
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,820
I already told you that I like Joo-in.

854
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,080
Is that a problem?

855
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,890
So you'll do as you please
without any regard for me?

856
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,370
I'll do as I please from now on too.

857
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,480
Wait.

858
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,440
I have something to tell you both.

859
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,460
You said you had something to say.

860
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,690
Joo-in, you told me you had
true feelings for me.

861
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,210
That's true. I like you.

862
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,910
What about that kiss on the cheek?

863
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,800
That was my true feelings too.

864
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,970
I like both of you. Writer Han and Yu-jin.

865
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,440
-What?
-What?

866
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:13,740
[Oh! Master]
