The smell of fresh printer ink.

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,820
Female killer...
I added some murder scenes that I like.

8
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,810
And introduced the Guitarist.
There are also some romantic scenes.

9
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,380
In the last mission, she pulls the trigger

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,770
but fails to kill him.

-She suffers from memory loss.
-What are you doing here?

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,520
Can't you tell? I'm working.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,879
How can you be here right now?
My mom is here.

Oh, I forgot.

-Hurry before my mom sees you.
-Okay.

-Hurry up.
-I'm packing my computer.

-Hurry.
-Honey.

Honey, good morning.

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,800
It must've been hard
to meet your deadline.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,180
What do you want for breakfast?

21
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,280
Kimchi stew with lots of fatty pork?

22
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,580
I'll fix it for you right now.

That's strange. We're out of fatty pork.

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,320
Joo-in, let's go to the supermarket
to buy some groceries.

27
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,000
Sure, Mom.

28
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,870
Honey! I'm going to buy groceries.
So be patient.

29
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,590
-Mom, get changed.
-Oh, okay.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,360
Leave after we go out, okay?

31
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,050
-Okay.
-Good.

32
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,980
No! No! We have to look for Dad!

33
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,510
No.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,630
Oh, your dad must have been very hungry.

35
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,890
He's waiting at the table
for his breakfast.

36
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,000
Honey, I'll fix breakfast in a minute.
Be patient.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,550
-Why didn't you go?
-Joo-in, I could use your help.

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,770
Oh, sure.

39
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,020
You can leave.
I'll come up with an excuse.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,270
My mom is going to keep
thinking you're my Dad

41
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,500
until her mental state returns to normal.

42
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,300
So leave the house while she's cooking...

43
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,170
Honey, the stew is almost ready.
I need you to taste it first.

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,950
Taste it? Well, you don't need me
to do that.

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,260
Mom and Dad
always call each other, "Honey".

46
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,620
Honey, ask Joo-in to taste the stew.

47
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,350
Joo-in, looks like Dad isn't feeling well.

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,080
He's too busy to even taste the stew.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,670
Massage his shoulders, Joo-in.

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,850
I don't think he needs a massage.

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,450
I'm fine. She doesn't have to.

52
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,130
Dad used to massage your legs so that

53
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,980
you would grow tall.
Why are you being like that?

54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,530
I'll rub your shoulders, Dad.

55
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,420
-Just go through the motions.
-Okay.

56
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,260
But your shoulder muscles are tight.

57
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,400
Let me see.

58
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,050
What on earth?
You don't actually have to do it.

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,030
Well, you worked hard all night.

60
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,659
So your muscles are bunched up.

61
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,140
You need to eat anyway
so stay for breakfast.

62
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,140
You love fatty pork.

63
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,920
There's a lot of chunky pork
in the stew today.

64
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,640
It looks delicious.

65
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,520
Why did your dad have to like fatty pork?

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,170
Open wide.

67
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,740
Well,

68
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,720
I'll let you have the first one.

69
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,810
Enjoy it, Honey.

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,050
Do you feel embarrassed to eat it
because Joo-in is watching?

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,570
Mom, seems like
Dad doesn't want fatty pork today.

72
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,140
Open wide.

73
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,690
I need to go to work now.

74
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,750
You work at home.
Where do you plan on going?

75
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,590
And you just finished your deadline.

76
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,280
I was hoping we could go out today.

77
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,290
Why don't you go out with Joo-in?

78
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,030
All right then.

79
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,690
But Dad.

80
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,550
"Dad"?

81
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,120
Why don't we all go together, Dad?

82
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,090
So... So where are we going?

83
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,610
How about a botanical garden?
Mom loves flowers.

84
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,760
I'd love that. A botanical garden!

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,990
My mom adores flowers.

86
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,020
But the nursing home won't allow
patients to bring fresh flowers.

87
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,700
So I always bring her artificial ones.

88
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,590
That made me a bit sad.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,480
Remember these Camellia flowers?

90
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,590
You gave me Camellias when you
asked me out on our first date.

91
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,110
Oh, I do remember.

92
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,090
And you told me what they symbolized.

93
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,680
Since Dad worked all night,
I don't think he remembers.

94
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,710
It means, "I love you
more than anyone else."

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,159
Dad would never forget that.

96
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,390
Those words set my heart aflutter.

97
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,880
You know what different flowers symbolize?

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,840
I did my research.

99
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,659
Are you saying I wouldn't have
characters that like flowers in my shows?

100
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,290
My mom is having a good time.

101
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,700
Thanks to you, she thinks she's with Dad.

102
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,540
Glad to hear that.

103
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,020
Stand right there.

104
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,520
You came out well. You look so pretty.

105
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,080
Let me take a photo of the two of you.

106
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,260
-What?
-All right.

107
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,730
How about we take one together?

108
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,870
1, 2...

109
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,490
Can you both try to smile?
You normally smile.

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,230
Dad. Say cheese.

111
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,600
Cheese.

112
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,510
It was great to see so many flowers.

113
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,860
Where else do you want to go, Mom?

114
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,409
We don't have to go anywhere.

115
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,780
All right then. Let's head home.

116
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,760
I just want to hold hands like this.

117
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,270
Joo-in, hold Dad's hand.

118
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,050
What? My palms are too sweaty.

119
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,490
I don't like touching sweaty palms.

120
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,930
Since when did you care about that?

121
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,190
-Wait.
-Mom.

122
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,420
Let's go.

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,450
I wish Joo-in would find a boyfriend

124
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,300
and get to hold hands on a date.

125
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,620
Joo-in, what kind of guy do you like?

126
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,620
-What?
-She asked you what's your type.

127
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,820
Well, any guy who treats you well, Mom.

128
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,090
That's you, Honey.
You're always nice to me.

129
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,230
Then you're the type of guy she likes.

130
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,810
Joo-in likes Dad so much.

131
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,930
Someone's playing the guitar.

132
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,920
It feels like time is standing still here.
It's nice.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,060
Mom, would you like to freeze time?

134
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,110
Yes.

135
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,590
I wish we could stop time

136
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,860
and freeze this very moment.

137
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,540
Any song requests?

138
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,780
"The Shampoo Fairy".

139
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,520
If you can't play it,
then just put the guitar down.

140
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,830
Joo-in, your dad has a few skills

141
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,940
that I never told you about.

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,880
Oh, it's not much.

160
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,820
Thanks, Dad.

161
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,930
For making Mom happy.

162
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
I didn't make her happy.

163
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,650
I was just playing a song
in front of two happy people.

164
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,180
You're such a witty talker.

165
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,830
Thanks for making this a special day.

166
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,950
Oh, sure.

167
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,670
What did they say? Is KT Cosmetics
going to sign Kim Ji-yeon?

168
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,980
[They'd like to convey
the company's decision in person.]

169
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,790
You've been their spokesperson
for five years, after all.

170
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,340
Out of courtesy, they would like to

171
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,440
tell you in person.
So you should meet them.

172
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,210
You said they'd tell us their decision.

173
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,180
Nobody mentioned having a meeting.

174
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,670
I'm in the middle of something
right now, so I can't go.

175
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,230
"Can't go"? Why not?

176
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,710
Sorry. Let me call you back.

177
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,650
Isn't that your sponsor
who wants a meeting?

178
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,750
-Yes.
-Why are you hesitating then?

179
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,170
How can I leave my mom here?

180
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,520
I'll stay with her.

181
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,790
You've been asking me to
pretend to be your dad.

182
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
Now's the time to ask for a favor
so that you don't miss your meeting.

183
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,790
Your mom wants what is best for you.

184
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,400
I wouldn't be happy to hear that you
got replaced by Actress Kim Ji-yeon.

185
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,740
Could you take my mom home?
I'll return in a short while.

186
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,660
A quick winding will do.

187
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,410
There you go.

188
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,120
I like the melody.

189
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,970
The director will be here in a minute.
Meanwhile, you can read the terms.

190
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,190
Thank you.

191
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,860
[Contract Renewal]

192
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,480
Jeong Yu-jin...

193
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,480
[Jeong Yu-jin, Director, KT Cosmetics]

194
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,710
That's the same name as my friend.

195
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,200
Yu-jin?

196
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,590
Surprised to see me?

197
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,990
I wasn't planning on joining
the family business.

198
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,590
That's why I didn't tell you
about what my family does.

199
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
But I ended up joining.

200
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,370
Your company's CEO is young though.

201
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,980
That's my sister.
My parents decided to retire.

202
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,460
I didn't know anything about you.

203
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,730
Do you feel like I lied to you?

204
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,710
How could you not mention
your family even once

205
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,810
while I was your company's
spokesperson for five years?

206
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,190
I wonder why I never said it.

207
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,370
What?

208
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,760
Do you remember what you told me once?

209
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,230
I said a lot of things. How could I?

210
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,790
You said I was a scion pretender.

211
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,230
If I had told you my family owns KT,

212
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,290
it would have changed our friendship.

213
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,880
But denying it would make me a liar.

214
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,610
So don't get mad at me for keeping
this a secret until now, okay?

215
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,760
Of course, I won't. You're my friend.
None of that matters to me.

216
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,600
So let's talk about your contract renewal

217
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,950
as our company's spokesmodel.

218
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,470
Indeed, Director Jung.

219
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,930
I appreciate it that you were
not embroiled in any scandals

220
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,900
for five years
while you were under contract.

221
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,420
So I added a retainer bonus
and increased the size of the contract.

222
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,270
Take a look at it
and sign it when you're ready.

223
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,210
I heard rumors that
Kim Ji-yeon would replace me.

224
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,950
But did you pull some strings?

225
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,940
If you find someone that's better
than you, please recommend her to us.

226
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,990
I couldn't find an actor
with a better image.

227
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,970
You have high standards, I see.

228
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,080
Kim Ji-yeon is our spokesperson
for our other brand.

229
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,140
How about we go out and celebrate
since you got your contract renewed?

230
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,170
I would love to, but I can't right now.

231
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,590
Can we do it another time?

232
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,960
Of course. I live in Seoul now.

233
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,430
You're going to be staying?

234
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,690
Yes.

235
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,750
-That's great.
-Me too.

236
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,030
You're closing already?

237
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,790
Oh, you didn't say you were coming.
What's up?

238
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,640
Did I come at the wrong time?
Are you busy?

239
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,780
No, I just wanted to close early.

240
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,339
Just because?

241
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,310
I like your outlook.

242
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,339
If you like something, you just like it.
You don't need a reason.

243
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,640
That's true.

244
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,859
Hae-jin,

245
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,710
let's go to a BB gun range.

246
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,060
I hit the target.

247
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,930
You're good at shooting.

248
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,940
That was fun.

249
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,450
You were always different
from the other girls.

250
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,220
You were different too.
It's strange though.

251
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,910
It feels like we've hung out
this whole time.

252
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,590
I don't feel awkward at all.

253
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:50,720
Maybe because we share good memories.
That hasn't changed.

254
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,610
I'm happy to have a new friend.

255
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,780
Me too.

256
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,200
You won the plush toy in one attempt.
I never won a toy.

257
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,630
I've always been good at winning prizes.

258
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,160
Most people have dinner
with their families at this hour.

259
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,350
My only son has his own place.

260
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,410
And my husband usually
eats out by himself.

261
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,500
What about you? You live by yourself
and eat your meals alone.

262
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,530
-Don't you get lonely?
-Sometimes.

263
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,670
But I was married once.

264
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,470
I like my current life.

265
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,960
Living together with someone
doesn't necessarily mean you feel close.

266
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm the opposite.

267
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm asking my son to move in with us.

268
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,000
But he won't listen.

269
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,400
If you want to be close to him,
it's better to leave him alone.

270
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,870
Living separately

271
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,310
could actually bring him closer to you.

272
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,270
Come in.

273
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,390
Want a beer?

274
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,210
Sure.

275
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,600
When I got back and saw you and Mom

276
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,280
dancing together,

277
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,900
I almost cried.

278
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,650
Looking at you now,

279
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,670
you resemble him a lot.

280
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,270
My dad.

281
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,180
Are you going to keep staring?

282
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,440
Thanks for spending time with my mom

283
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,200
and helping me.

284
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,260
I wasn't trying to help

285
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,020
just because she's unwell.

286
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,120
What?

287
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,110
Your mom has a special ability
that other people don't have.

288
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,560
She can recreate her past

289
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,740
and relive it.

290
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,640
And it was my lucky day to be able to

291
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,150
use your mom's ability for one day.

292
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,670
I think you're a good person, Bi-soo.

293
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll go to bed now.

294
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,510
Oh, okay.

295
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,630
A good person?

296
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,110
A good person.

["Guitarist, Female Killer", Episode 1]

Mom.

300
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,520
What are you reading, Mom?

301
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,420
"Guitarist, Female Killer".

302
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,760
I haven't read that before.

303
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,360
It's a page-turner.

304
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,590
I think you'd be perfect for this role.

305
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,490
Han Bi-soo wrote this, didn't he?

306
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,590
Han Bi-soo?

307
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,810
You knew it was him?

308
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,030
Yes.

309
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,550
Actually,

310
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,380
I regained
my senses later in the afternoon.

311
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,120
[I snapped out of my episode]

312
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,470
[when I was listening to the music box.]

313

[He resembles your dad a lot.]

[I was so mortified
that I made a big mistake.]

315
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,600
Did you tell Writer Han?

316
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,100
Yes. But I asked him for a favor.

317

[spend the whole day]

[with me and act like my husband.]

[And he asked me what I wanted
to do with my husband]

[So he]

323

agreed to dance
to my favorite music with me.

324
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,920
Just like how your dad and I
used to dance.

325

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,220
[Sein Hospital]

327
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,950
Where's the VIP patient
that was admitted last night?

328
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,260
We're readying him for surgery.

329
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,350
Who will operate?

330
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,360
Dr. Lee will, Doctor.

331
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,980
No, tell them I'll lead the surgery.

332
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,330
Okay, I'll let them know.

333
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,460
What were you two doing in there?

334
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,820
Are you sick, Honey?

335
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,980
-What?
-She had a stomachache. It's not serious.

336
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,670
You just came out of
the radiography room. That's not serious?

337
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,520
Am I overreacting?

338
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,910
Lower your voice.

339
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,960
I have surgery to do,
so let's talk later about this.

340
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,770
-What are those pills for?
-I have indigestion.

341
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,660
Thanks to you, I had a great stay, Honey.

342
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,280
Be safe, Honey.

343
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,020
We took away a lot of your time
when you needed to write.

344
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,580
So get some rest.

345
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,930
Sure. Dad will get some rest.

346
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,360
So drive Mom back, Joo-in.

347
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,720
Okay.

348
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,140
Let's go.

349
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,470
Oh, gosh.

350
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,830
Yes.

351
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,610
-Where are you writing the script?
-In the house.

352
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm at the house right now.

353
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,020
[Jae-hwan's stuff is here,
but I don't see any of your belongings.]

354
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,320
The jig is up. So tell me.

355
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,250
Mr. Yoo.

356
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,190
Jae-hwan won't tell me
where you're staying.

357
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,490
Mr. Han, did you hear that?

358
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,600
I didn't tell the boss anything.
Just remember that.

359
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,780
[What does it matter where I work?]

360
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,970
I'm writing a sick script,
so don't worry about it.

361
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,980
You can end the lease for that house.

362
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,380
Find a workspace for Jae-hwan.

363
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,820
I'm back.

364
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,200
You came quick.

365
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,880
My mom needed to rest too.

366
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,230
Did you get some rest?

367
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,920
Yes, until someone started talking to me.

368
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,120
By the way, my mom likes your script.
"Guitarist, Female Killer".

369
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,060
She read my script?

370
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,650
She said the role would fit me.

371
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,670
Your mom has a good eye.

372
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,890
What about you, Joo-in?

373
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,360
Joo-in?

374
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,390
I don't like calling you Master.

375
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,110
Fine. I'll be patient.

376
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,100
I'll give you my answer
after I receive episode two.

377
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,660
You're pushing me to finish episode two,
aren't you?

378
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,410
I found this in the mailbox.

379
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,020
Doesn't your agency
receive your fan letters?

380
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,630
There's no return address and no name.
How did it get mailed?

381
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,570
You must've bragged to all your friends
about the new house you bought.

382
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,420
I only told a few friends.

383
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,440
What's wrong?

384
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,110
[Die. Your most glorious day will turn out
to be the worst day of your life.]

385
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,880
[Die. Your most glorious day will turn out
to be the worst day of your life.]

386
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,060
Someone seems to hate you a lot.

387
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,070
There's no explanation or any reasons.

388
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,870
It's a typical hate letter.

389
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,320
You can't stay in this business
if you let this bother you.

390
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,290
I'm going to take a nap.

391
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,970
Sure.

392
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,950
I think she should be concerned.

393
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,710
Is something worrying you?

394
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,110
-What?
-You rub your ear when you're worried.

395
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,400
I got this letter.

396
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,470
It was hate mail sent by
someone who doesn't like me.

397
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,110
I'm trying to not think of it,
but it's hard not to.

398
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
Let's go.

399
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,690
Are we going somewhere?

400
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,540
A place you were at 14 years ago.

401
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,340
All right. Time's up.

402
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,900
Thank you for your work.

403
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,370
Everyone, give her a hand.

404
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,920
-What is that?
-A unicorn.

405
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,300
Why am I riding a unicorn?

406
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,450
Unless you're extremely lucky
or blessed by the Almighty,

407
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,340
it's nearly impossible to ever
meet a unicorn.

408
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,620
I'm not a lucky person.

409
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,680
Not true. You'll find luck soon.

410
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,440
And what if that doesn't happen?

411
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,290
I'll make it up to you then.

412
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,340
Luck follows those who smile.

413
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,140
You're going to get lucky soon.

414
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,540
You're so silly.

415
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,280
When did you set up your room like this?

416
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,000
What?

417
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,450
You still have this drawing?

418
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,590
Of course.

419
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,990
"Your most glorious day"?

420
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,530
It will turn out to be

421
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,780
the worst day of her life?

422
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,980
Which day will be Joo-in's
most glorious time?

423
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,260
Oh, gosh.

424
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,760
It'll turn out to be the worst day
of her life?

425
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,330
It feels like I'm at an art exhibition.

426
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,860
You're pausing your career
as a visual artist?

427
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,380
Yes, for now.
I'll resume when I feel like it.

428
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,610
Here.

429
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,750
Vin Chaud smells so nice.

430
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,340
Drink it slowly. It's hot.

431
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,830
This brings back memories
of my first trip to Paris.

432
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,050
It was five years ago.

433
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,730
You had just finished your
third TV miniseries as the lead.

434
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,750
You even remember that?

435
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,820
I was thrilled that we had
the shoot on location in Paris.

436
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,630
You know I went to see you
in between the shoots.

437
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,810
I know.

438
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,409
And you drank three glasses of Vin Chaud.
I prepared them myself.

439
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,510
You make the best Vin Chaud.

440
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,360
You should serve it to the girl you love.

441
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,699
She'll love you even more.

442
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,770
I think I'm an eligible bachelor
even without my mixology skills.

443
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,830
Then date someone.

444
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,960
I'll find someone soon.

445
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,230
You're very confident.

446
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,250
I would say that I'm prepared for dating.

447
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,980
It's so good.

448
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,350
[Oh Joo-in]

449
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,480
I'll cook a nice meal for you sometime.

450
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,800
You don't need to.
Leave the cooking to me.

451
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,110
What a nice house.

452
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,840
[When you brought me here]

453
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,770
[and told me you'd get
your old home back one day,]

454
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,150
[I knew you'd succeed.]

455
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,640
Thanks. Now you have to go.

456
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,110
After I see you go in.

457
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,570
But why aren't you asking me
if you could see my house?

458
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,310
Well, you'll invite me over
when you feel like it.

459
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,160
Go first.

460
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,510
Okay. Bye.

461
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,660
Be safe. Bye!

462
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,260
Why are you standing out here?

463
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,890
You're reckless.

464
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,320
Where were you this whole time?

465
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,410
I was with a friend.

466
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,760
You're not concerned?

467
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,360
-About what?
-That threatening mail.

468
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,760
You're worried about my safety?

469
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,900
Yes.

470
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,150
I'm really worried about that letter,
but you're not worried?

471
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,020
Looks like you have a boyfriend.

472
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,030
What did he say about this situation?

473
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,840
I don't have a boyfriend.

474
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,770
What?

475
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,950
What?

476
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,970
You should be careful
about going out at night!

477
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,990
Okay?

478
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,290
What do you think, Joo-in?

479
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,660
You know what I like.

480
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,300
It's very pretty.

481
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,020
-You like it?
-It's so pretty.

482
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,130
Can you show me another outfit?

483
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,600
Sure.

484
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,170
-What about this one?
-It's a beautiful dress.

485
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,560
-Oh, I like the color.
-It's very pretty.

486
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,120
And the embroidery design is cute.

487
