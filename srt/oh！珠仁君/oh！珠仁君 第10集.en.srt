So what's going on this time?

-Leaning on your shoulder

It's my fault too.

I should've waited a little longer
at the restaurant.

It's not entirely your fault.

But I didn't leave early on purpose.

151

I was alone in a private room,

So I couldn't stay there like that.

154

Come on, Chief.

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,060
So he's been working furiously.

168
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,710
Fine, fine.
So he's working hard. I get it.

169
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,940
Just tell me how much progress he's made.

170
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,450
He probably finished writing episode five.

171
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,010
It takes a little time
to make some final edits.

172
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,860
A little time? At this rate,
we're going to have trouble

173
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,300
with the schedule if the scripts
are not finished on time.

176
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,740
What?

177
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,630
When will you get episode five done?

178
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,200
-You'll be finished by this week, right?
-Be patient.

[I just met with the chief.]

180
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,640
Hey,

181
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,370
he was putting a lot of pressure on me
about the scripts.

182
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,600
He said he can't work with us
if we keep delaying.

183
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,830
Are you mad? I see that you're mad.

184
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,390
All right. Now channel that anger
and finish the script.

185
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,740
Finish them all!

186
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,040
Be patient.

187
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,050
Is two months enough?
You can finish it in that timeframe.

188
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,730
Just get it done quickly.

189
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,880
Tell me where you want to take a vacation.

190
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,360
Hawaii? Bali? Or the Maldives?

191
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,880
That place is heaven on earth.

192

194
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,960
You stayed up working all night again?

195
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,760
Worry about yourself.

196
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,020
Don't mind me.

197
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,330
Then don't make me worried.

198
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,860
Joo-in, you must know
why Mr. Han won't finish the script.

199
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,720
It's not that he won't. He can't.

200
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,990
What? Why can't he finish it?

201
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,670
I think he's going through a hard time.

202
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,350
You're defending him based on a hunch

203
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,500
that he's dealing with some issues.

204
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,400
I saw him working at his desk
all night long.

205
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,380
Joo-in, come to your senses.
This is your show we're talking about.

206
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,240
You made demands
that he change the script.

207
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,420
You're overseeing the whole process.

208
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,480
So you need to make him finish it.

209
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,330
You don't know why
the scripts are being delayed.

210
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,180
So how can you defend Mr. Han?

211
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,650
I'll find out why.

212

[49 days from now,]

214
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,570
Having writer's block is tough, isn't it?

215
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,590
Don't mind my problems.

216
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,280
I want to help you with the process.

217
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,630
I can handle this.

218
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,140
Leave me alone.

219
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,410
Didn't you hear me?

220
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,610
Even when you were having a hard time,
I felt like you had things under control.

221
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,960
But now,

222
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,850
I'm not so sure.

223
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,750
When I was going through tough times,
you were supportive.

224
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,220
When my mom couldn't recognize me,

225
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,500
you reassured me that I was doing the best
a daughter could ever do.

226
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,360
When you get writer's block, you go crazy.

227
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,080
You snuck into this room to

228
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
get your mojo back and finish the script.
I kicked you out afterward.

229
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,150
When my mom came to visit,

230
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,300
you continued to work on
the script in this room.

231
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,250
I know that

232
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,000
you are

233
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,680
trying to write,

234
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,370
but you just can't.

235
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,280
Don't think that you know everything
about me.

236
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,020
You can tell me what is it.

237
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,280
There has to be a reason
why you can't write.

238
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,710
I said I'll handle it.

239
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,390
Just leave me alone!

240
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,110
Yes, Yu-jin.

241
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,680
I have some free time,
but I don't know what to do with it.

242
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,280
It would be wonderful
if you'd hang out with me.

243
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,900
Oh, gosh. Yu-jin.

244
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,840

245
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,320
[Please come.]

246
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,060
I was about to visit my mom.

247
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,080
-I can give you a ride.
-No. I'll stop by your place.

248

It's nice to see you like this.

249
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,700
I saw you yesterday.

250
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,100
That was for a business meeting
as our company's spokesmodel.

251
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,810
How did you hurt your hand?

252
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,170
-I was working on my punches.
-Didn't you bandage your hands?

253
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,550
You must've thrown hard punches.

254
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,630
You get a few scrapes
when you do a real workout.

255
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,320
Is Bi-soo still making you worry?

256
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,520
No, everything is fine.

257
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,620
I can tell you're worried.

258
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,560
You vented your frustrations
by hitting a punching bag.

259
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,130
For real.

260
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,810
I'm fine.

261
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,200
Hold on.

262
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,230
I'm really fine.

263
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,230
Give me your hand.

264
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,410
Tell me if it hurts.

265
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,140
Okay.

266
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,650
Joo-in.

267
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,780
Yes?

268
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,090
Whether you're fine or not,

269
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,330
just don't get hurt, okay?

270
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,400
Got it.

271
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,670
Let me see.

272
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,900
Thanks.

273
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,510
Did Ms. Oh mention anything about Mr. Han?

274
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,710
The boss is really worried
about the script delays.

275
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,390
Difficult writers need more time

276
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,360
to produce excellent scripts.

277
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,210
They have their own process.

278
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,280
Of course, you have a perfect personality.

279
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,300
And you'll write perfect scripts.

280
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,480
You're perfect too.

281
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,420
So stop worrying. Let's eat.

282
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,560
Open wide.

283
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,220
How perfect.

284
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,910
The way you ate it was so sexy.

285
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Now have another one.

286
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,780
My Jae-hwan. Open wide.

287
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,170
It's your boss!

288
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,880
Mr. Yoo, I thought you went home.

289
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,930
Yes.

290
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,260
You ordered all that food for yourself?

291
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,490
I didn't eat anything all day, so...

292
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,730
Are you staying late at the office?

293
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,250
I'm sleeping in the office
to get more work done.

294
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,470
All right. I need one of you
to be working hard.

295
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,900
[You're mine. I love you, Jae-hwan]

296
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Mr. Yoo.

297
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,510
Actually, I don't have a place
to stay for several days.

298
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,690
I'm sorry for not telling you
about this sooner.

299
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,410
In a few days, I'll have it sorted out.

300
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,580
-You're dealing with a situation?
-Yes.

301
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,720
Okay.

302
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,200
Just make sure the office stays clean.

303
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,460
Thank you.

304
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,570
I'll work hard, Mr. Yoo.

305
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,190
Gwang-ja, my boss left.
You can come out now.

306
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,330
-Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, gosh!

307
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,890
Mr. Yoo.

308
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,400
It's nothing.

309
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,430
Have a good day!

310
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,260
Gwang-ja, you can come out.

311
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,940
He really left.

312
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,290
-Did he leave?
-Yes.

313
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,880
I almost had a heart attack.

314
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,620
-You were so smooth.
-I will

315
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,900
book a hotel suite room for you soon.

316
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,910
Just be patient.

317
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,020
Anyplace with you
is like staying at a five-star hotel.

318
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,090
Oh, you came, Joo-in. My gosh.

319
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,580
Bi-soo didn't come with you?

320
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,490
What? You're wondering about him
when I just got here?

321
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,760
Come on. Don't be jealous.

322
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,070
You know why I like Bi-soo.

323
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,800
He's the one who makes you happy.

324
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,990
In that case, I forgive you.

325
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,770
This room feels like a vacation suite.

326
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,320
I wish I could go on a trip.

327
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,660
Then take a trip.

328
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,270
How about we go somewhere?

329
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,910
I don't want to go on a mom-daughter trip.

330
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,800
Go with Bi-soo instead.

331
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,070
Did you just reject my offer?

332
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,060
Actually, I'm planning a surprise trip

333
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,700
with Hae-jin.

334
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,560
You didn't tell her about it yet?

335
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,110
No.

336
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,310
You don't look that excited though.

337
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,570
I don't?

338
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,510
It's just that it's uncertain

339
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,950
how much time we still have to take trips.

340
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,740
I'll travel with you
until you can't stand it anymore.

341
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,560
But where's Bi-soo's mom?

342
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,430
Well...

343
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,030
What's the problem?

344
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Since I'm a rival, you won't tell me?

345
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,130
Don't you have more important stuff to do
than asking me personal questions?

346
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,890
Not you. I mean Joo-in.

347
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,160
Joo-in looks troubled and sad lately.

348
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,290
And it's because of you.

349
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,060
You can read her thoughts?

350
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,290
I guess you don't know that she rubs
her earlobes when she has a problem.

351
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,780
I gifted her earrings
when she got her first TV role.

352
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,290
She began rubbing her earlobes

353
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,050
because she wasn't used to
wearing earrings.

354
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,150
Ever since then,
she would rub her earlobes

355
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,830
whenever she was dealing with issues.

356
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,840
But

357
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,620
she's been rubbing her ears a lot
after you entered her life.

358
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,970
Don't be bothered by it.

359
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,990
No, I can't.

360
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,340
When I'm around, Joo-in laughs a lot.

361
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,020
And I'm going to keep making her laugh.

362
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,210
What about you?

363
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,320
What are you doing for Joo-in?

364
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,700
These days,

365
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,750
she's been hooked to an IV drip.

366
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,060
That's how she is.

367
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,130
She's very sick?

368
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,610
She's getting treated and resting, but...

369
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,420
Does Bi-soo also know?

370
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,740
She doesn't want him to know.

371
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,470
So don't tell him, okay?

372
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,400
Okay.

373
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,950
Joo-in.

374
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,660
I know how he feels.

375
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,680
He's acting out lately. But he
probably doesn't mean the words he says.

376
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,750
If I were in his shoes, I would also
have trouble concentrating on work.

377
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,900
It's just a brief phase for him,
so I'll give him a pass.

378

I've only caused you pain.

379
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,240
If the only thing I can do for him

380
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,130
is bear the brunt of his outbursts,

381
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,790
then I'll endure it as long as I can.

382
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,140
I've got strong stamina.

383
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,040
So this is when I'll put it to use.

384
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,200
Do you know what he says most often?

385
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,430
That's a relief.

386
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,960
It's a relief

387
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,720
that I'm here for him.

388
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,050
He can at least act out around me.

389

There isn't.

00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,820
I don't know why I treated you like that.

494
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
I was in a bad place.

495
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,480
I'm sorry.

496
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,760
Sorry.

497
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,800
Joo-in.

498
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,820
I made your life hard, didn't I?

499
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,410
Yes, you did. It was really tough.

500
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,060
If you're going through something,
then you can just tell me about it.

501
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,160
Why do you suffer alone?

502
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,220
You're so peculiar.

503
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,620
I am

504
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,010
a peculiar guy, you know.

505
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,950
I'm going to give you another chance.

506
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,340
But if you do this again,
that'll be three strikes.

507
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,600
I'll kick you out of my house.

508
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,290
I can't get kicked out of here.

509
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,430
How about we go on a date somewhere nice?

510
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,610
You think one date will make it up to me?

511
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,320
I do know a nice place.

512
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,540
Where?

513
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,080
Congratulations on returning
to your normal self.

514
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,740
There's a reason why I acted like that.

515
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,470
But I can't tell you.

516
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,440
And I won't tell anyone.

517
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,050
If you give me a pass on that,

518
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,280
I'll make sure to never keep
any other secrets from you.

519
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,930
As long as the secret isn't
about some other girl.

520
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,480
Absolutely not.

521
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,470
Then let's do a pinky promise.

522
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,890
Whoever caused this
must feel guilty right now.

523
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,790
All right.

524
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,680
Wow, it healed.

525
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,260
Don't say you'll leave the house
no matter how tough it gets.

526
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,070
Don't say you want to break up.

527
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,490
If you don't keep your promise,
then it'll be really over.

528
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,350
You can't back out of this promise.

529
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,590
-Okay.
-Okay.

530
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,640
I'm sorry for making you wait.

531
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,570
It's fine. Don't mention it.

532
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,630
You're wondering why
I asked you to come here, right?

533
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,810
Yes.

534
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,540
Is it because of the scripts being late?

535
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,160
Oh, the delays are problematic,
but that's not why I called you.

536
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,920
Then is it

537
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,820
about that time?

538
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,570
You're cute.

539
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,110
Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about.

540
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,680
And you are cute.

541
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,360
Thank you!

542
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,400
Oh, I shouldn't have blurted that out.

543
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,760
After you said that,

544
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,320
I couldn't stop thinking

545
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,760
about what you meant by that.

546
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,140
-But...
-Yes?

547
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,700
But it doesn't go

548
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,460
beyond that.

549
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,690
I don't want you to suspect
that there's more to it.

550
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,750
Isn't it a good thing?
When you said I was cute?

551
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,320
Looking at the situation
with Joo-in and Mr. Han,

552
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,220
I think it will be better
if we kept things professional.

553
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,020
You're turning on all the lights.

554
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,880
Before my mom began living
at the nursing home,

555
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,440
she would frequently be hospitalized
because of her condition.

556
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,760
So I'd usually be alone in a dark home.

557
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,180
I didn't like the feeling.

558
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,430
Turning on the lights makes
things brighter and warmer.

559
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,690
It feels like you have company.

560
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,550
Now you have me.

561
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,360
You're not alone anymore.

562
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,700
You're all talk.

563
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,050
Don't ever act like that again.

564
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,750
Joo-in, you know that...

565
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,730
Why don't you bring that?

566
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,470
My goodness. Look at this stomach.

567
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,150
Hey, Joo-in beat you up

568
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,300
while pretending that you were me,
didn't she?

569
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,810
How did you know?

570
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,080
You went through a lot, teddy bear.

571
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,840
-Bi-soo, don't write.
-What?

572
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,490
Try to banish thoughts
about having to write.

573
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,890
And focus on
what you like the most in life.

574
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,540
And wait until you're ready
to write again.

575
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,480
What I like the most?

576
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,130
What do you like the most, Joo-in?

577
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,870
Being with you, Bi-soo.

578
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,890
And what else?

579
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,240
Even if the world
comes to an end tomorrow,

580
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,960
I would stand in front of a camera

581
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,730
if I had a TV shoot.

582
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,960
Because I love acting.

583
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,730
Sleep in my room tonight.

00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,510
What?

586

this is work.

In this client-agency meeting,

Ms. Kim,

616
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,560
I'm not going to ask Bi-soo to leave.

617

That's what you want to talk about?

618

I understand why you're mad.

619
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:49,370
But I am serious

620
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,960
about my relationship with Bi-soo.

621
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,910
Joo-in, you're a top celebrity.
You know what that means.

622
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,970
It means that you have to sacrifice

623
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,150
normal activities that other people do.

624
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,960
In this business,
you just can't like anyone

625
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,980
and openly express your feelings
to that person and go on dates.

626

Bi-soo needs me

I'll talk to Mr. Han
and straighten this out with him.

No, don't.

630
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,860
Bi-soo doesn't even know

631
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,790
that we're discussing this about him.

632
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,900
If he were to know,
he'd probably move out.

633
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,730
So you like him a lot.

00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,330
If he loves you too,

635
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,260

644
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,750
What? You'll barely impress me
even if we were to go to a fabulous place.

So where is it?

You'll find out.

00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,800
She can keep doing what she's good at.

656
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,650
I'm not letting her sink my project.

657
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,170
I wanted to beat you up that day.

658
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,930
I'll let you beat me up now.

659
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,460
I brought you here

660
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,700
to change that bad memory into a nice one.

661
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,180
First, let me apologize

662
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,240
for hurting you like that.

663
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,260
I'm sorry.

664
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,600
A mere apology is not enough.

665
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,250
Then

666
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,650
will this make things better?

667
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,760
When you're dealing with issues,

668
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,350
don't rub your earlobes anymore.

669
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,840
Rub the pendant instead.

670
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,210
You're very smooth.

671
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,640
I am?

672
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,690
A smooth lover.

673
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:05,040
If you don't like it, you can
exchange it for a different one.

674
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,340
Even if I don't,

675
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,450
I don't give back what's given to me.

676
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,170
I'll have to give you a pass again.

677
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,060
Nice.

678
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:16,090
A simple sorry won't
work on me next time though.

679
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,280
Okay. I won't forget that, Master.

680
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:55,650
Can we spend the night together?
For real, this time.

681
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,640
You have my face plastered everywhere
in your room already.

682
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,540
So think about me tonight.

683
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,260
Let's sleep separately for now.

684
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,290
Then let me sleep in your room.

685
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,770
I slept so well in your bed.

686
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,130
You have to save the best for last.

687
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,230
Next time.

688
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,880
I'm turning in. Sweet dreams.

689
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,430
Joo-in.

690
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,270
How about we take
a morning stroll tomorrow?

691
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,450
Okay.

692
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,950
I wanted to have a relaxing stroll.

693
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,680
Oh, it's nice.

694
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,350
So suddenly?

695
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,750
-This isn't it?
-No.

696
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,820
Don't pull back.
Stay in one place and bob.

697
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,210
In one spot?

698
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,100
-Like this?
-Yes.

699
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,620
Don't move backward. Bob forward.

700
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,060
-Jab!
-Yes. Jab.

701
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,530
Like this?

702
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,390
And when your opponent attacks,
you do this!

703
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,990
What's that? Is it your technique?

704
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,220
Yes. Try and hit me as hard as you want.

705
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,810
And we'll see who tires out first.

706
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,130
You wait for an opening
and then throw a counter punch.

707
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,460
Wait for an opening
and then the counter punch.

708
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,820
You can throw a punch.

709
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,210
My coaching lessons are expensive.

710
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,850
Name your price.

711
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,740
Bi-soo?

712
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,730
You will

713
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,830
keep

714
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:59,930
loving me the same

715
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,910
tomorrow, in two days,
and a year from now, right?

716
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,430
This hug means you will, right?

717
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,950
[I'll keep loving you]

718
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,670
[forever.]

719
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:06,410
[Oh! Master]
