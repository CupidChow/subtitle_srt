00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,460
Meeting you like this is nice.

164
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,440
You enjoy tormenting
your rival, don't you?

165
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,590
How is investing in your show
tormenting you?

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,400
It's because of Joo-in, not me.

167
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,580
That's not completely true.

168
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,090
I've watched all of your shows.

169
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,730
And I believe your new project
will be a tremendous hit.

170
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,200
You have a good eye.

171
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,700
You have the same tastes as me.

172
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,300
And your aftershave.
It's the same one I use.

173
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,730
As someone who runs a cosmetics company,

174
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,820
you should bring your own aftershave.

175
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,330
Are you inviting me over again?

176
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,320
Businesspeople are a different breed.

177
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,380
You turn every situation
into one that benefits you.

178
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,570
The clarity in this picture is better,
isn't it?

179
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,350
Is it a more recent photo?

180
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,540
Did you call me here to show me that?

181
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,590
Of course not.

182
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,060
If you've finished touring my office,

183
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,740
-could we talk business?
-Sure.

184
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,440
But mine is bigger than his.

185
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,710
A lot bigger.

186
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,990
I'm not jealous!

187
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,300
[Oh Joo-in, Jeong Yu-jin,
Oh Joo-in, Han Bi-soo]

188
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,140
What? Writer Han's name
is also showing up.

189
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,340
People already figured out
the two men in your life.

190
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,610
And the radio show you hosted
was a sensation.

191
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,090
You didn't expect that?
I've got star power.

192
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,440
When your new show premieres,
what if Mr. Han's name

193
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,960
appears higher in the search results
than Director Jeong's?

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,100
Will that set in motion

195
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,120
a big fight between two of your suitors?

196
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,590
Joo-in!

197
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
You made the radio show
the number one show yesterday!

198
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,390
The radio producer said you fulfilled
her wish to rank top in the ratings.

199
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,690
She was delirious with joy.

200
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,210
Let me give you a ride home today.
I feel like I owe you.

201
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,230
Boss!

202
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,540
It's my job to drive Joo-in home.
So you don't have to.

203
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,850
Yes, I'll go with Gwang-ja.

204
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,750
Joo-in, that makes me feel left out.

205
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,310
I want to do something for you.

206
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,740
And you haven't invited me
to your new house yet.

207
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,210
I was waiting for an invitation.

208
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
It's kind of overdue.

209
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,030
I was going to invite you
as a special guest soon.

210
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,150
That's right. Because you're special.

211
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,300
Today is perfect for me.
I didn't get you a housewarming gift yet.

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,520
I'll take a tour of your home.

213
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,080
Then I'll be able to
get you the perfect gift. Let's go!

214
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,130
Now?

215
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,860
You got this!

216
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,380
Were you waiting for me at home?

217
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,020
You opened the door so quickly.

218
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,740
What's that garbage?

219
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,040
Garbage? Which one?

220
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,280
I don't know why people like flowers.

221
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,390
Flowers wilt right away and then give off
an odor. Then you have to throw them out.

222
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,400
They're useless.

223
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,750
Joo-in likes flowers a lot.

224
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,250
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm allergic to flowers.

225
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,180
You have allergies?

226
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,400
I'm scared of spring.

227
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,840
I hate people who travel
in groups to see flowers bloom.

228
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,350
Flower bouquets make me cringe.

229
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,360
Then?

230
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,390
Could you place those flowers
where I can't see them?

231
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,940
Please.

232
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,630
Does he really have allergies?

233
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,740
Gwang-ja, I like it when you come
to see me so suddenly.

234
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,910
The boss said I could get off work
since she'll give Joo-in a ride home.

235
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,340
What if Mr. Han is home
when they get there?

236
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,810
I'm sure Joo-in will call ahead.

237
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,700
-What did you say?
-Oh, nothing.

238
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,220
I came in a rush to see you, Jae-hwan.

239
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,630
-I was missing you too. Sparks flying!
-Sparks.

240
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,800
-That hurts!
-That hurts!

241
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,410
How wonderful. We connect so well.

242
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,300
-I'm worried about being so happy.
-Why?

243
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,780
It feels like the calm before a storm.

244
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,510
There is no storm coming. So why worry?

245
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,540
Just enjoy these sweet moments.

246
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,950
[Dad]

247
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,470
Answer it. What's wrong?

248
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,950
He hardly ever calls. Excuse me.

249
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,650
Hello? Yes, Dad.

250
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,940
So you want me to go on an arranged date?

251
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,000
But Dad, I'm seeing someone.

252
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,730
He's five years my junior.

253
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,040
Okay.

254
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,000
Jae-hwan, what am I supposed to do?
My dad set me up on an arranged date.

255
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,690
Why would you go on a date
when you're with me?

256
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,700
I have to go.

257
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,630
I can't disobey my dad.

258
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,730
He'll kick me out of
the house if I don't go.

259
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,000
This is the storm I was worried about.

260
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,390
-This one?
-Yes.

261
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,510
You grew up in this home

262
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,280
-and lived here for many years, right?
-Yes.

263
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,750
But why do you look so anxious?

264
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,740
Well, the house is a mess.

265
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,550
Could I invite you over next time
when it's cleaner?

266
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,940
That doesn't matter at all to me.
Let's go in.

267
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,450
Just a minute.

268
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,140
What is this?

269
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,110
I don't know.

270
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,070
Where on earth is he?

271
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,990
I think I know who's waiting inside.

272
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,109
This is a totally different look
from your apartment.

273
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,339
Did Mr. Jeong pick out the furniture?

274
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,040
What? Oh, yes.
Yu-jin picked the furniture.

275
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,760
Why is Mr. Han in your house?

276
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,630
Let me explain.

277
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,700
I'm here to discuss the script.

278
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,300
In her house?

279
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,720
I was in the area, so I dropped by.

280
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,280
I invited him over.

281
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,750
Because it'd be a problem
if we were to meet in public.

282
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,890
While we were having a meeting outside,
she suddenly had to leave.

283
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,370
I forgot that I had another appointment.

284
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,480
So I came here and made the script changes

285
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,900
that she requested.

286
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,560
But why did you shower?

287
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,760
I got something on my clothes.

288
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm very obsessive about hygiene, you see.

289
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,500
He throws out any clothes that

290
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,390
get a stain on them.

291
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,500
You two...

292
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,970
I knew you were very close.

293
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,150
But I hope this won't create
any scandalous rumors.

294
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,790
You need to be mindful of that.

295
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,850
What if Mr. Jeong
had seen you two like this?

296
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,150
I'm fine with it.

297
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,540
Hello, Ms. Kim.

298
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,470
It's nice to see you here.

299
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh, Mr. Jeong. I saw the roses
you laid out for Joo-in.

300
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,740
But how are all three of you
here like this?

301
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,120
I was with Joo-in earlier,

302
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,880
and she got a call from Mr. Han.

303
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,360
So I proposed that she invite him over
to talk about the script.

304
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,750
As an investor in the project,
I wanted to hear about the show.

305
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,530
Everything is clear now.

306
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,710
I know that Joo-in
is a close friend of Mr. Han.

307
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,890
But...

308
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,470
You and I are close friends too. Right?

309
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,090
Sure. We had coffee in your office too.

310
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,690
Time flies when we spend time together.

311
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,460
-The three of us.
-Yes.

312
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,860
If it's all right with you,
then that's all I need to know.

313
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,830
Mr. Han.

314
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,400
I'm sorry if I was asking
too many questions.

315
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,670
My obsession with hygiene
caused a little misunderstanding.

316
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,610
Then I'll get going.

317
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,290
Oh, please stay. Have a cup of coffee.

318
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,220
I brew very good coffee.

319
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,990
Oh, I couldn't.
You need to discuss the script.

320
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm leaving, Joo-in.

321
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,970
-Come again!
-Okay.

322
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,980
This is

323
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,710
your fault, Joo-in!

324
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,140
Why are you blaming me?

325
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,530
He's right.

326
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,180
It's because
you're such a popular actress.

327
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,730
Is that what this is?

328
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,910
I guess you're right.

329
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,570
Now I owe Mr. Jeong for saving us
from a hairy situation.

330
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,720
You're thanking me, right?

331
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,360
I guess.

332
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,770
-What are you doing?
-You have something to say?

333
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,260
I was wondering if you need
to borrow my aftershave.

334
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,600
I brought my own.

335
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
What are you looking at?

336
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,450
Oh, you're a good artist.

337
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,550
But it's ruined because of me.

338
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,860
That must irritate you.

339
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,250
No, it's not irritating. I'm angry.

340
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,850
Then you could use a drink, don't you?

341
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,570
What?

342
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Thanks, Yu-jin.

343
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,080
How did you know those were from me?

344
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,640
Writer Han would never get me flowers.

345
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,210
I thought your mom was
the one who liked flowers.

346
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,060
She takes after her mom.

347
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,580
Bi-soo, you're also an artist?

348
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,930
Mr. Jeong drew it.

349
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,660
I was going to show you that illustration

350
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,170
at the other end of the row of roses.

351
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,600
It's so nice.

352
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,750
I'm very touched.

353
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
It looks pretty.

354
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,150
Your phone number, please.

355
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,320
What for?

356
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,090
To prevent another situation
like this from happening.

357
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,660
We'll need each other's contact
in case Joo-in's boss comes again.

358
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,440
Hello, this is Jeong Yu-jin.

359
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,580
Hope we'll get along.

360
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,220
Not necessary to say that.

361
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,980
I'm going to win her heart.

362
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,500
-I'll call you when I get bored.
-Don't call me anytime you want.

363
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,930
I'll block your number.

364
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,300
I envy you, Mr. Han.

365
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,940
I didn't hear you.

366
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,830
I envy you.

367
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,150
I'm sure you do.
But what do you specifically envy?

368
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,210
I'm in a fake relationship with Joo-in.

369
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,310
But you're actually living with her.

370
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,710
And you've gotten really close after that.

371
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,980
I can't compare to the 14 years
you've known her.

372
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,920
If your long friendship

373
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,020
turns into a romantic relationship,

374
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,630
I have no chance of winning her.

375
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,220
Is that how you see it?

376
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,340
They're not talking behind my back,
are they?

377
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,460
You drink your whiskey on the rocks too?

378
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,500
I love the sound of the ice
knocking around the glass.

379
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,770
You savor the whiskey
while listening to that sound.

380
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,860
Exactly.

381
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,970
We seem to have a lot in common.

382
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,950
And we both like Joo-in.

383
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,260
-Which one? Piano or guitar.
-1, 2, 3.

384
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,690
-Guitar!
-Guitar!

385
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,210
Van Gogh or Paul Gauguin?

386
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,430
-Paul Gauguin!
-Paul Gauguin!

387
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,070
I thought you'd like Van Gogh.

388
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,630
What? Based on what?

389
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,150
Van Gogh is a moodier painter.

390
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,720
And you write crime thrillers.
That's dark and moody.

391
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,030
-Roses or chrysanthemum?
-Roses!

392
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,870
Why didn't you say anything?

393
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,760
You like roses? For real?

394
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,440
You said you were allergic to flowers.

395
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,190
Oh, come on!

396
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,420
You like something more
when you can't have it.

397
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,360
When someone tells you not to do it,
you want to do it more.

398
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,000
When you said you were allergic
to flowers,

399
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,470
you really thought I believed you?

400
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,820
I just went along with it.

401
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,250
Now Yu-jin.

402
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,740
You're a good fella.

403
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,130
Bi-soo.

404
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,490
I came up with a clever idea.

405
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,210
What is it? Tell me.

406
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,520
Go ahead, fella.

407
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,860
So you're going to follow my idea, right?

408
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,170
100 percent.

409
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,180
It's a very clever idea.

410
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,410
We can't let Joo-in

411
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,430
control the situation forever.

412
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,660
Then you agree
we'll do it together, right?

413
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,620
Okay!

414
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,060
You just wait, Joo-in.

415
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,870
It's our turn.

416
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,280
Hello?

417
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,720
Is anybody home? Close the door first.

418
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,420
-We came. Anybody home?
-There she is.

419
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,590
What's going on?

420
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,940
Bi-soo and I had a drink together.

421
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,640
I have something to tell you. Follow me.

422
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,390
Follow me.

423
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,790
What?

424
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,680
So you want me to go on a date

425
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,820
with each of you separately,

426
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,670
and then I have to decide who I'll date?

427
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,480
That's absurd.

428
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,120
You said you like both of us.

429
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,090
We accepted that too.

430
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,490
But still...

431
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,180
The Joo-in I knew was a very fair person.

432
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,580
I think you were mistaken
about that about her.

433
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,680
Hold on.

434
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,360
I'm thinking.

435
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,880
Tomorrow evening,
go on a date with Yu-jin.

436
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,980
And the day after that,
go on a date with Bi-soo.

437
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,740
We'll set the rules.

438
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,630
And you'll follow them.

439
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,760
Okay?

440
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,170
If you don't accept our terms,

441
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,360
then we'll stop liking you.

442
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,540
Joo-in, accept this offer

443
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,890
so that we can still like you.

444
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,560
All right.

445
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,980
Let's do it.

446
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,590
Yes.

447
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,200
[Sein Hospital]

448
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,620
What's that shiny aura behind you?

449
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,830
You're so radiant.

450
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,030
-Congratulations, new Chairwoman!
-My gosh.

451
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,580
Thanks, Hae-jin.

452
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,760
I feel pressured
to receive a flower bouquet

453
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,870
from the former chairwoman. I feel like
I'll be in trouble if I don't deliver.

454
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,550
Don't work so much.

455
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,070
When you have time,
come to my nursing home.

456
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,020
You're already calling that place
your home?

457
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,200
But you look happier.

458
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,350
Not only do I look happier

459
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,240
but check out my outfit.

460
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,240
Oh, wow.

461
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,260
That's a colorful scarf.

462
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,240
Why didn't you wear those sooner?

463
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,090
You're a fashion model.

464
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:14,580
Really?
Maybe I'll try out for a modeling career.

465
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,100
With your looks, it's never too late.

466
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,450
Let's have lunch together.

467
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,970
I'd love to, but I have to meet someone.

468
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,770
What are you doing?

469
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,460
-Can't you see?
-You're pressing the same spot.

470
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,730
I have my own method.

471
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,750
Joo-in isn't up yet?

472
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,810
Seemed like she slept late.

473
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,280
Did our offer shock her?

474
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,900
You're nervous about your date with Joo-in

475
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,700
-later tonight, right?
-Not at all.

476
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,720
You'll be nervous, not me.

477
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,420
Gosh.

478
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,120
It was your plan

479
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,150
to have Dr. Jung become
the new chairwoman, right?

480
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,590
I recommended both of you to the board.

481
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,060
I believed that both of you

482
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,710
would be good leaders.

483
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,270
Yet, it's true that you trust her more.

484
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,680
I do agree more with her management style.

485
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,700

When Bi-soo moved out,
it felt a little empty.

Finding out whom you truly like

532

All right then.

Why did you get a divorce, Chang-gyu?

My ex-wife wanted it.

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,900
Before we got married,
she liked my carefree life.

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,130
But after living together with me,
she didn't like it.

551
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,960
It hurt that what made her attracted
to me repelled her later.

How did you meet her?

553
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,450
She was a regular customer.

554

She'd come to my store
wearing a dress suit.

And always looked tired.

Her face would light up
when I picked out albums for her.

I liked that about her.

A dress suit?

She must have been
very different from you.

It's fun to be around Jung-hwa.

650
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,330
Time passes so quickly.

651
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,010
It's like going to a party.

652
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,410
Are you getting treated?

653
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,300
I can come by tomorrow.

654
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,950
Call ahead.

655
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,690
And come with Joo-in if you can.

656
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,700
[Okay. I'll visit with her.]

657
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,100
You complained that
I wasn't calling you often before.

658
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,410
But you hardly call me lately.

659
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,510
[Bi-soo.]

660
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,530
I have to go eat breakfast.

661
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,390
So eat a healthy breakfast.

662
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,990
[Okay.]

663
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,090
[-Enjoy your breakfast.]
-Okay.

664
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,790
She's here.

665
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,370
Why did you come together?

666
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,520
I wanted to stay with her
as long as I could.

667
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,530
If Joo-in chooses me,

668
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,250
then coming here would be uncomfortable.

669
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,350
So don't get used to this place.

670
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,700
-That's a surprise.
-What is?

671
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,340
I was going to say those
exact words to you, Bi-soo.

672
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,430
Joo-in...

673
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,300
What are these flowers?

674
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,130
Why'd you put those flowers there?

675
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,640
Oh, those?

676
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,510
I pressed each one onto the window.

677
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,310
You could call it artwork.

678
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,460
It's on a different level
from scattering roses in the courtyard.

679
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,060
You said you had a flower allergy.

680
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,860
You got inspired by my roses, right?

681
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,420
You copied my work.

682
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,230
You copied me first.
The picture of her hanging in your office.

683
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,170
What's wrong with hanging a commercial
poster of our spokesmodel in my office?

684
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,090
How was spending the night
with Director Jeong?

685
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,110
It was fun and very comfortable.

686
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,380
Then that must have been
the perfect evening.

687
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,530
You don't need to spend the evening
with Mr. Han then. It's over.

688
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,540
I'd give a score of 100 to Yu-jin.

689
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,600
But that doesn't necessarily mean
it's the best score.

690
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,580
I don't understand what you're saying.

691
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,520
It's a perfect score, I mean.

692
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,910
There's nothing I can add to it.
No surprises.

693
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,390
You mean he doesn't make your heart
skip a beat?

694
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,910
That's temporary.
Over time, you get comfortable.

695
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,840
What do you want then?

696
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,100
I don't know.

697
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,090
[Bi-soo's father]

698
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,730
Yes?

699
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,790
Was there another reason

700
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,890
you wanted a divorce?

701
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,790
What is this all of a sudden?
Make yourself clear.

702
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,350
Did you ask for a divorce

703
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,400
because you found someone else?

704
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,460
[What evidence is your question based on?]

705
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,590
I haven't seen anybody else
while we were married.

706
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't know why you're bringing this up.

707
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,150
Sorry. I had the wrong idea.

708
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,670
Get some sleep. You must be tired.

709
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,100
Joo-in, you know your music.

710
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,910
Mr. Han probably has this album,
doesn't he?

711
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,770
No, he doesn't have that one.

712
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,450
I'm certain.

713
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,300
He likes that album,
so why didn't he buy it?

714
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,950
I don't know his reasons.

715
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,480
He would come here to listen to it
whenever he got the urge.

716
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,680
Then I'll buy it.

717
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,530
Good.

718
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,770
This is a rare album.

719
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,890
You're home.

720
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,860
How do you like it? Our camping grounds.

721
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,260
Why did you prepare all this?

722
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,230
Because you thought I'd like it?

723
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,340
No, because I like camping.

724
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,040
I wanted to recreate a scene
where we're camping on a mountaintop.

725
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,560
I like it.

726
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,830
Good job for setting this all up.

727
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,850
Here's a present.

728
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,650
An LP album?

729
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,300
I asked Chang-gyu for a recommendation.

730
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,600
He said you didn't have this one.

731
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,770
-That's strange.
-What?

732
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,780
This is my favorite album.

733
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,130
Then why didn't you buy it?

734
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,950
I didn't want to buy it myself,
so I held back from buying it.

735
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,970
I'd rather have someone buy
it for me as a gift.

736
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,030
And you did it, Joo-in.

737
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,960
If it were my favorite album,

738
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,390
I would have bought it right away.

739
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,280
Because it's my favorite thing.

740
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,780
Like when people don't buy

741
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,880
their own birthday cakes.
That's how I would explain it.

742
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,990
I'm glad I got you the present you wanted.

743
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,660
I'm kind of hungry.

744
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,980
-Can you also cook here?
-Of course.

745
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,080
I'll prepare the world's best meal.

746
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,600
So get changed first.

747
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,040
I picked out your outfit.
It's in the living room.

748
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,440
Go change into it.

749
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,660
Okay.

750
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,340
It tastes so good
since we're on a mountaintop.

751
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,860
I went hiking alone in high school

752
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,250
and spent several days in the mountains.

753
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,350
The noodles I ate then tasted so good.

754
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,290
You went camping during summer break?

755
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,550
No. I skipped school.

756
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,870
I sent a text to my mom and went hiking.

757
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,140
You weren't a model student, I guess.

758
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,290
Everyone has that kind
of experience once in a while.

759
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,570
I wonder what kind of experiences you had.

760
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,040
I'll tell you next time.

761
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,640
You'll get an upset stomach
if I tell you now.

762
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,410
That was a good meal.

763
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,920
It was delicious.

764
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,240
-I'll do the dishes.
-No.

765
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,180
You can't even if you wanted to.

766
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,530
We're in a mountain. There's no water.

767
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,250
So sit down.

768
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm not cold.

769
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,190
You can catch a cold anytime.

770
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,210
Don't give me a hard time later.

771
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,940
Why would it be a hard time for you?
I'd be the one with a cold.

772
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,340
And you call yourself
the queen of romantic comedies?

773
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,720
Listening to music and drinking coffee
in a cafe in the mountains...

774
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,190
It's so nice, isn't it?

775
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,670
-But there's one thing missing.
-What's that?

776
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,280
It would be nice to see the stars.
That's impossible, right?

777
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,580
You can see the stars.

778
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,350
-Where?
-I picked out a spot

779
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,780
where you can see the stars.

780
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,050
You can't see the stars in the city.

781
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,570
What? You don't believe me?

782
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,510
I can pluck the stars
out of the sky for you.

783
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,990
How can you pluck a star?

784
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
Gosh.

785
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,140
-What?
-My gosh!

786
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:43,890
My gosh. Goodness me.

787
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,530
Let me see.

788
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,260
Here. I picked out this wonderful spot.

789
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,490
Wow, you weren't bluffing.

790
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,810
When did you prepare this?

791
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,780
I'm a well-prepared guy.

792
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,720
I should be focusing
all my attention on writing.

793
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,200
But someone keeps distracting me.

794
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,880
I guess I'll have to stop distracting you.

795
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,400
That'll be your loss.

796
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,370
What?

797
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,180
I'm the only one who can

798
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,620
pluck a star out of the sky for you.

799
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,490
So this is how a star feels.

800
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,890
It's the first time I've touched a star.

801
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,360
And how does it feel?

802
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,860
It felt like it was so far away.

803
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,470
They twinkle in the night sky.

804
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,820
But I thought they'd be cold to the touch.

805
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,250
Touching it now,

806
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:54,740
it feels warm.

807
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,520
It's warmer than I thought.

808
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,730
I like it.

809
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,090
A warm star.

810
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,930
When I was in high school,

811
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,660
I told you I spent days in the mountains.

812
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,570
I came to the realization

813
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,100
that I could make a living from writing.

814
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,950
Did you only think about
writing crime thrillers?

815
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,300
No.

816
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,620
I didn't choose any genre or anything.

817
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,060
I was going to write whatever
I felt like writing each time.

818
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,090
And somehow,
they all turned out to be crime thrillers.

819
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,280
How about now?

820
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,750
Now?

821
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,740
Now...

822
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,730
I want to

823
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,130
write about you.

824
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,660
Maybe because all I think about is you.

825
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,990
I just weave you into my writing.

826
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,540
Without even realizing it.

827
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,500
If you don't choose me...

828
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,150
Even if

829
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,350
you choose Yu-jin,

830
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,330
I'll respect your choice.

831
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,590
Thanks

832
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,650
for making me

833
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,260
look forward to tomorrow.

834
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,640
Joo-in...

835
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,830
Joo-in.

836
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,670
[Dad]

837
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,530
[Dad]

838
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,120
[Dad]

839
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,720
[There's something I need to tell you.]

840
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,190
[Let's meet.]

841
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,950
Why did you want to meet?

842
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,140
I've decided to sign the divorce papers.

843
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,490
I heard that Mom wanted a divorce.

844
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,850
Did you know your mom
is staying at a nursing home?

845
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,290
Why did you allow that?

846
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,920
I can't make her listen. She's stubborn.

847
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,740
You should've stopped her.
You're her husband.

848
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,170
You should've stopped her
if you're not going to give up on her.

849
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,280
So you know about that.

850
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,130
Did you call me here

851
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,360
because you were worried
about that incident?

852
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,830
There's no need to tell her

853
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,010
now that we're divorced.

854
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,700
I want to have an amicable divorce.
That's all.

855
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,970
It's my decision
whether to tell her that or not.

856
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,860
If you tell her what you saw that day,

857
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,710
I won't stand around

858
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,220
and do nothing.

859
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:25,780
You threatened me back then,

860
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,540
and now you're doing it to me again.

861
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,510
I'm just saying
we should both be respectful.

862
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,330
I know your secret,

863
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,180
but I'm keeping it to myself.

864
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,740
-What secret?
-I won't tell you first.

865
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,880
Until you say it.

866
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,380
At your mom's urging,
I saw you a few times.

867
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,890
And when I did,

868
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,760
I realized that I am your dad, after all.

869
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,370
What I mean is...

870
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,570
You don't consider me as your dad.

871
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,280
[I know your secret,]

872
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,170
[but I'm keeping it to myself.]

873
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,510
Why did you come alone?
Why didn't you bring Joo-in?

874
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,780
I met Dad.

875
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,600
That's a surprise. You went to see him?

876
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,540
Mom.

877
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,160
Dad says there's a secret about me
that he won't tell me.

878
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,780
And he said something else that was weird.

879
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,350
What did he say?

880
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,710
He said he realized he's my dad,
after all.

881
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,870
He said that?

882
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,190
What about it?

883
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,310
He probably thinks
he had shortcomings as a dad.

884
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,530
Mom.

885
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,470
If there's a secret about me
that I don't know, I want to know it.

886
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,690
It's my right.

887
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,880
Bi-soo.

888
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,860
The secret he's talking about...

889
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,440
Does that mean he's not my dad?

890
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:23,480
[Oh! Master]
