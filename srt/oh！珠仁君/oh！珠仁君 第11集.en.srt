Since you're being so cute today,
I'll make time to have tea with you.

13
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,520
I have to meet someone.

14
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,160
Who?

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,970
-It's a secret.
-A secret?

Who are you seeing?

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,009
I heard that you know that

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,830
Joo-in and I are living in the same house.

20
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,820
Then you probably know what my demand is.

21
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,180
I'll tell you my answer first.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,120
Don't say you'll leave the house
no matter how tough it gets.

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,630
I won't be able to live there
much longer anyway.

What is that supposed to mean?

25
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,720
I made these plans.

Does Joo-in also know?

Mr. Han, why are you so self-centered?

28
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,320
Although I'm against
the two of you dating,

29
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,210
it's only right that you tell
Joo-in about your plans.

Okay.

-Did you tell her your feelings?
-No.

68

She'll probably say no anyway.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,170
You think she knows
how you feel, don't you?

70

Until you tell her, she'll never know.

71

It's better to get rejected by a girl
than to keep your feelings to yourself.

I can't believe I'm getting
dating advice from you.

00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,670
Did you lose the house keys?
Why didn't you just come in?

82
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,230
I wanted to see you
opening the door for me.

83
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,270
I did it a couple of times
before, you know.

84
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,670
Well, at that time,
I was an uninvited guest.

85

But now, you wonder
when I'm not coming home.

86
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,190
You're such a player.

87
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,630
-Do you hate me for it?
-I didn't say that.

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,040
Joo-in is in a merry mood.

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,990
There's a spot here.

90
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,540
Where?

91
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,140
Here.

92
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,340
-On its ear.
-What?

93
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,020
What did you just do?

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,840
That was very clever.

95
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,980
Don't you agree?

96
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,630
Don't punch and curse
at the teddy bear anymore.

97
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,310
Treat him nicely.

98
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,970
If you ever make me upset,
I'm going to pummel you.

99
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,430
You said it was a relief that I had you
because I could act out around you.

100
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,270
But you weren't there when I said that.

101
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,510
It's a relief

102
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,690
that I'm here for him.

103
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,670
He can at least act out around me.

104
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,380
No, you told me that.

105
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,470
What?

106
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,990
I'm right. You said it.

107
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,430
Now you're getting mixed up.

108
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,659
I won't punch you. So come back here.

109
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,420
Now Bi-soo tells me
what he's doing even before I ask.

110
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,320
There's satisfaction
in reining in a hot-tempered guy.

111
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,140
Once you nab a guy like him,
he'll only have eyes for you.

112
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,990
What are you saying?

113
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,230
Why else would I talk to a teddy bear
unless I were bored?

114
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,330
If I were Bi-soo, I'd suggest we go out.

115
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,270
Why is he just standing there?

116
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,830
You're so cute.

117
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,150
-Let's go.
-Where to?

118
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,920
-Let's go.
-Where?

119
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,880
Oh, my.

120
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,730
What brings you here?

121
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,750
Bi-soo says he'll pick up the pace
with finishing the scripts.

122
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,530
You could have just called me.

123
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,890
Actually, I'm here today...

124
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,590
What is this?

125
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,650
These flowers represent my feelings.

126
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,760
I like you a lot, Ms. Kim.

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,440
I felt that I made my feelings
clear to you.

128
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,960
I never got to tell you about my feelings.

129
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,020
It was nice and comfortable
when you listened to me so well.

130
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,120
But you only hear
what you want to hear, it seems.

131
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,010
Ms. Kim, it's not like that.

132
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,690
Let me repeat this.

133
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,670
I'd like to only talk business with you.

134
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,270
I'm sorry. This won't ever happen again.

135
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,580
Bye.

136
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,150
Darn it, Bi-soo.

137
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,260
I do like flowers so much.

138
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,200
Since when did this place
become a pet clinic?

139
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,760
What are you talking about?

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,310
You said I was like a cat.

141
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,040
Now you know who you are.

142
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,310
He won't "scratch" you again, Chang-gyu.

143
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,860
Can I believe that?

144
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,100
Don't you get lonely
when you're all alone here?

145
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,220
Now you're teasing me
after getting a girlfriend. You punk.

146
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,990
I'm just concerned.

147
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,140
You were once married.

148
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,160
Wasn't it hard to be alone
after the divorce?

149
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,550
What is this?

150
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,830
I've known him for 18 years, but he never
showed concern about that before.

151
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,970
He was thoughtless.

152
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,110
Are you two getting married?

153
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,420
-What?
-What?

154
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,770
We're not at that stage.

155
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,040
Well, you bring up my divorce
when you haven't even gotten married yet.

156
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,480
It's so wonderful to be dating someone.

157
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,000
I'd hate to imagine
how bad a breakup would be.

158
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,140
Why are you thinking
about that all of a sudden?

159
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,920
Because I'm so happy with you.

160
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,050
This single old guy is going home.

161
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,780
I think you've trained your "cat"
very well so far.

162
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't give up on him.

163
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,650

How will you train me today?

167

How about we start with music?

168
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,410
I'd like that.

169

This album was the last one the singer
released right before his death.

170
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,360
That makes it more special.

-Yes.

172

Because you like this album so much.

But how about we listen to
something else instead?

Why haven't you been coming?

I thought I was going to

Why isn't he answering his phone?

It feels good that I'm the first person
you did things with.

315
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,140
But I prefer to be the last person.

316
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,160
-Why?
-Being the first also means

317
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,860
that I might not be the last one.

318
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,810
But being your last girl means we'll be
together through good or bad times.

319
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,990
Why did we stop here?

320

I'm going to write a letter
and put it in this mailbox.

326
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,660
"Send a letter that will be delivered
a year later. A cherished memento."

327
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,860
So you'll read my letter a year later,
and I'll read yours.

328
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,930
Sounds fun. Getting a letter a year later.

329
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,640
[Worried about hurting you]

330
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,210
I'm sorry for hurting you before.

331
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,860
A simple sorry isn't enough.

332
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,990
Will that make it up to you?

333
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,340
I didn't want that.

334
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,620
[We came too far.]

335
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,250
We came too far.

336
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,270
It's not that far. If there's no traffic.

337
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,550
We've come too far to go back.

338
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,050
What if we went back
to the time when we first met?

339
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,820
I would slap you hard.

340
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,590
Why? Because I was a jerk?

341
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,340
You bastard.

342
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,600
I thought you were a bastard.

343
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,300
You totally confused me.
You're actually a really good guy.

344
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,210
Let's not play the dating game
since it's a waste of time.

345
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,680
Just be my boyfriend.

346
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,970
All right. Be my girlfriend.

347
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,730
Ms. Kim!

348
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,110
[President Yoo Dae-young]

349
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,270
My goodness, Mr. Yoo.

350
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,620
Are things not working out well
with Ms. Kim?

351
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,920
What? How did you know that?

352
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,490
You yelled, "Ms. Kim" in your sleep
and then woke up.

353
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,050
I think I've gone crazy.

354
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,490
That's how love works.

355
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,080
What?

356
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,110
Ever since you've been dating Gwang-ja,
you've become more creative.

357
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,760
Until I met Gwang-ja,
I never dreamed about dating anyone.

358
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,490
But love came. Out of the blue.

359
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,190
For some, finding love takes a lot of work
and also fighting off rivals.

360
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,460
For others, love just charges in
like a summer shower.

361
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh, dear.

362
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,690
Summer shower is here.

363
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,910
What? Why am I a "summer shower"?

364
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,400
Jae-hwan is totally enveloped by you,
Gwang-ja.

365
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,560
Where are you going, Mr. Yoo?

366
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,030
You should comb your hair first.

367
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,350
Write yours here, Joo-in.

368
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,060
We have to look away when writing?
What are you going to write?

369
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,200
You'll find out a year later.

370
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,040
[To Joo-in,
With our backs facing each other...]

371
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,220
You're working late as usual, sir.

372
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,730
I'm about to turn in.

373
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,700
Mr. Park.

374
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,470
How about we go for a drink?

375
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,680
Sounds great.

376
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,570
What is it? Something came up?

377
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,650
The girl I broke up with...
She wants to see me now.

378
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,710
Go and see her.

379
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,480
Thank you.

380
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,650
[For others, love just charges in
like a summer shower.]

381
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,300
-I'll have the strongest whiskey you have.
-Okay.

382
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,110
That's enough.

383
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,840
You've had enough!

384
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,520
What are you doing?

385
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,020
You'll say I'm cute again
after you drink a lot.

386
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,210
Then you'll say you don't
like me the next day.

387
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,980
And that will

388
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
break my heart again.

389
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,490
After which, I'll come to this bar again.

390
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,970
And I'll see you sitting across me
once again.

391
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,730
That will repeat itself over and over.

392
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,880
You're very mistaken.

393
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,210
Women call guys "cute"
when they don't think

394
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,100
he's attractive.

395
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,350
This is like a palace
where a princess would live.

396
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,160
I know a real princess.

397
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,640
Why am I a princess?

398
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,950
I didn't say it was you.

399
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,610
-Long, long ago,
-Yes?

400
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,000
there was a writer who was cursed.

401
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,150
He was arrogant and rude.

402
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,510
He talked bluntly to people
and was a real jerk.

403
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,690
And then?

404
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,710
But one day, a princess called

405
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,770
Joo-in appeared before him.

406
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,330
-That's me?
-Yes.

407
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,810
The curse was lifted after Princess Joo-in

408
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,740
changed his behavior.

409
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,980
She changed his monstrous personality
into a more civilized one.

410
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,580
How does it feel to be reborn
as a civilized person?

411
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,480
Oh, I feel like I got my life back.

412
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,290
Princess.

413
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,400
-Are you taking a photo of me?
-I'm taking a video.

414
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,290
That's so cool.

415
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,410
-It's nice.
-Looks nice.

416
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,060
This moment won't return.

417
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,830
Why are you saying that?

418
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,920
Well, when a moment passes,
it's in the past.

419
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,320
It feels so special right now.

420
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,100
Don't say that. If you feel wonderful,
just show it with a smile.

421
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,460
That's a grin.

422
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,650
Smile. Like this.

423
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,080
Wider.

424
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,780
-Wider.
-Like this?

425
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,130
-While smiling.
-Okay.

426
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,410
Wider.

427
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,720
[She's drop-dead gorgeous.]

428
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,560
[When you think of glamour,
you think of her.]

429
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,200
[Every woman wants to be like her.]

430
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,220
[I had an interview with Oh Joo-in.]

431
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,830
[We're on the set of
a cosmetics commercial shoot.]

432
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,480
[She's always lovely. She...]

433
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,780
[-That's so cool.
-I'm dizzy.]

434
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,800
[Oh Joo-in]

435
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,000
[Master]

436
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,210
-Master!
-Oh, gosh.

437
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,190
Come on.

438
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,560
You had to change my contact name
before getting changed?

439
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,000
Am I the only one who changed it?

440
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,190
You're late. I already renamed yours.

441
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,170
-What did you name it?
-It's a secret.

442
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,950
Secrets don't last forever, you know.

443
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,260
So tell me now when I'm being nice.

444
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,210
-No.
-Come here.

445
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,260
Let go. Be still.

446
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,500
Sorry.

447
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,060
Be still.

448
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,670
Let me have a look.

449
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,640
Let's see your little secret.

450
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,740
[Han Bi-soo]

451
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,510
With a heart sign?

452
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,950
Nice. A heart.

453
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,760
That's wholesome. Good.

454
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,400
But why am I the "Master?"

455
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,520
Because I found the master of my life.

456
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,530
I trained you well.

457
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,360
Joo-in, you know me.

458
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,580
Don't let your guard down.

459
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,480
You still have your old personality.

460
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,420
You'll always have it.

461
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,540
How was today?

462
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,940
It was wonderful, of course.

463
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,830
What did you like the most?

464
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,610
Writing the letter.

465
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,690
I got nervous thinking about
when you'd read it a year later.

466
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,680
Can you tell me a little
about what you wrote?

467
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,640
No.

468
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,050
Just wait to be moved when you read it.

469
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,240
-So I'll get it a year later, right?
-Yes.

470
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,250
What will we be like then?

471
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,360
I don't know.

472
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,860
It would be great if things stayed
like this a year later.

473
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,040
Why won't he tell me? What did he write?

474
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,429
[With our backs facing each other,
I'm writing this letter to you.]

475
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,460
[A year later, it would be nice
if I could read your letter too.]

476
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,410
[But I won't be alive a year from now.]

477
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,800
[The best thing I did in my life]

478
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,460
[was falling in love with you.]

479
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,880
[When I die,
I want to die while loving you.]

480
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,300
[Will you let me?]

481
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,540
This is your best work so far.

482
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,270
Why'd you get me so worried
when you could do such fine work?

483
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,660
Sorry for the long delay.

484
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,800
It was worth the wait.

485
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:19,150
About that person who you said needed
to watch this show sooner than later...

486
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,960
Is that person all right?

487
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,900
She's managing.

488
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,880
Can I ask who she is?

489
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,370
She's my mother.

490
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,930
Oh, gosh.

491
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,710
It'll be hard to reschedule
the show's premiere date.

492
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,770
But if there's anything else you need,
feel free to tell me anytime.

493
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,840
What did the chief say?

494
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,930
What?

495
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,200
Oh, the chief?

496
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,140
When I put my mind to it,
I bang out good scripts.

497
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,620
You impressed me too with your script.

498
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,360
But you don't look happy.

499
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,600
It's impossible for my mom
to watch my show.

500
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,660
I wish she could see it.

501
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,790
Let's make it possible.

502
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,980
How?

503
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,290
Am I the killer?

504
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,230
I keep dreaming of a gun and knife.

505
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,170
No, that can't be.

506
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,400
You were a talented dancer.

507
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,540
Don't lie! I killed someone.

508
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,640
You're lying for my sake!

509
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,910
No.

510
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,390
You're right! You're a killer.

511
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,110
What does that matter?

512
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,770
What's important right now
is that I'm in love with you.

513
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,790
I think I'm in love with you too.

514
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,190
If I could be with you even
if it were for one day,

515
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,190
I would happily spend it with you.

516
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,700
Thanks.

517
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,230
Every day I spend with you
is the best day of my life.

518
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,230
Did you kiss her?

519
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,870
That's...

520
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,560
I'll leave that to your imagination.

521
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,920
It's so much better than
watching a show on TV.

522
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,900
Thanks so much, Joo-in.

523
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,010
How would Bi-soo have turned out
if he hadn't met you?

524
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,070
-I would be miserable.
-You know the truth.

525
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,610
I hate to say this, but I need to go to
an appointment now.

526
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,800
Well, there's always another time.

527
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,890
Let's go.

528
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,380
Next time, let's talk about
Bi-soo's annoying habits.

529
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,610
Oh, I'd love that.

530
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,480
When you said, "I love you" to Joo-in,

531
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,580
I got so excited.

532
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,670
You did?

533
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,560
I succeeded then.

534
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,290
I was trying to move you, Mom.

535
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,150
I was worried about how you'd
deal with my illness.

536
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,520
It's nice to see you smiling.

537
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,320
You told me before, Mom.

538
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,390
That every day
is the best day of your life.

539
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,040
I'm trying to think like that.

540
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,590
Good.

541
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:53,600
Keep showing me that smile, son.

542
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,390
And do things you usually don't do.

543
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,070
Okay.

544
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,760
It's rather nice to try new things.

545
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,180
You seem to like it too.

546
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,730
I'll be back. So goodbye to
all Peach Family members.

547
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,770
Cut. Great job.

548
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,320
-Great job.
-Good work.

549
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,960
-Wonderful.
-Bring the microphone.

550
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,600
We'll send you the video when it's done.

551
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,740
-Okay. Good work.
-Good job.

552
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,490
I don't like this awkwardness between us.

553
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,260
Can't you accept
my living arrangement with Bi-soo?

554
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,910
I'd like to understand it.

555
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,430
But I can't.

556
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,290
Mr. Han said he plans to leave the house.

557
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,590
I didn't order him.
He said he already planned it.

558
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,360
I think you misunderstood him.

559
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,000
He didn't mention anything
like that to me.

560
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,560
This is exactly why
I don't understand Mr. Han.

561
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,370
It's for this reason
I want you to reconsider dating him.

562
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,220
Where are you?

563
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,280
Yes. I just got here.

564
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm with Ms. Oh, and we're inside now.

565
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,060
Can you see us?

566
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,690
Did anything happen today?

567
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,280
Let's talk.

568
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,490
-Jae-hwan, you can wait in my room.
-Sure.

569
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,790
You're leaving this house?

570
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,820
Did Ms. Kim tell you?

571
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,450
Under our lease contract, I'm supposed
to leave when I finish the script.

572
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,680
You should've told me first.

573
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,240
Nothing will change.
Things will be the same with us.

574
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,560
But it's not a personal matter.
Leaving here is our matter.

575
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,760
Is it that hard to discuss this with me
before making that decision?

576
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,750
No, it's not hard at all.

577
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,950
I'm just telling you what it
says in the contract.

578
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,650
So our relationship is determined
by a contract?

579
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,050
I was the only one who
thought differently.

580
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,350
I'm ready to learn from you, Mr. Han.

581
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,650
Rewrite it.

582
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,290
What?

583
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,080
I need some input before I can rewrite it.

584
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,240
I would if there was anything
in the script that showed some promise.

585
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,280
Who's barking?

586
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,720
It's my text notification.

587
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,450
Turn it off.

588
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:06,800
Mr. Han, I'm sorry,
but could I make a phone call?

589
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,150
-No, you can't.
-Oh, okay.

590
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,320
Gwang-ja moved out of her house
because her dad is against us dating.

591
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,840
And she's staying at our office for now.

592
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,780
She seems to be scared to be alone there.

593
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,800
Is she a little child?

594
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,480
Call her here!

595
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,800
What? For real?

596
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,860
Tell her to pack her things and come here.

597
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,800
Mr. Han, you have such a kind heart.

598
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,120
Under one condition.

599
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,650
-My Jae-hwan!
-My Gwang-ja!

600
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,010
-I missed you.
-Me too.

601
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,780
Thanks, Joo-in for letting me stay here.

602
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,460
You don't have to thank me.

603
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,780
It's thanks to Bi-soo's generosity.

604
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,420
Thanks, Bi-soo.

605
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,640
Come in.

606
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,170
I brought pizza. You're favorite food.

607
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,810
Let's eat it before it gets cold.

608
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,980
Hold on. That's my seat.

609
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,470
You can sit here.

610
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,120
We need to celebrate on a day like this.

611
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,260
What are we celebrating?

612
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,530
On this day, you shot
your first pizza commercial.

613
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,140
After that, you were cast in
so many commercials.

614
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,320
This sure is a cause for celebration.

615
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,470
I remember it was winter that time.

616
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,740
It was a chilly spring day.

617
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,090
How could I forget?
You were the first celebrity I worked for.

618
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,790
Sure. My Gwang-ja has a sharp memory.

619
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,950
You think "My Gwang-ja"
is a lovey-dovey term?

620
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,630
I call Joo-in, "Master".
My significant other.

621
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,860
Don't you agree, Master?

622
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,580
Master?

623
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,140
What did you do to make him say that?

624
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,280
I didn't do anything.

625
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,170
He does whatever he wants
without asking first.

626
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,740
Fantastic tasting pizza with rich cheese.

627
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:15,400
Take a bite and make good memories.

628
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,290
That's a great copy.

629
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,960
I'm not going to eat anymore.

630
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,610
A floral scent that lasts all day long.

631
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,380
You'll remember it even
with your eyes closed.

632
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,690
Cherish it.

633
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,700
To quench your thirst or quench your love?

634
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,770
Today, I'm going to tell her I love her.

635
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,500
I love you!

636
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,560
Let's have a beer.

637
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,830
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

638
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,310
-I love you.
-I love you.

639
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,800
I love you.

640
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,960
Who's going to clean this up?

641
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,310
You can do that later.

642
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,290
You're going to leave this mess
just like this?

643
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,430
Since when did you change?

644
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,980
He changed.

645
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,800
We'll take care of this.

646
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,970
Mr. Han.

647
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,780
And the women can rest.

648
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,640
Let us. Ms. Oh.

649
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,210
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

650
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,200
I think I threw my back
like the time I was in the bathroom.

651
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,550
How would bumping into you
throw your back?

652
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,620
I've heard of people
throwing their back while asleep.

653
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,800
Oh, no. I'll go to a pharmacy right away.

654
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,270
Wait for me.

655
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,030
I can hardly stand up.

656
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,040
It's hard to even move a muscle.

657
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,810
Could you assist me, Joo-in?

658
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,480
Oh, gosh.

659
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,930
Careful, careful!

660
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,320
My goodness.

661
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,930
Would you be so kind as to
stay by my bed and care for me?

662
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,210
That's enough. Your charade is so obvious.

663
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,320
Did it show? Was my acting that bad?

664
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,710
How could I not tell?

665
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,970
So stop being mad.

666
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,690
Stay here.

667
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,310
Joo-in.

668
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,490
Master!

669
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,210
Sunny side up, please.

670
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,360
Mr. Han, could you fry it sunny side up?

671
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,790
Okay. Over hard eggs coming up.

672
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,520
Good morning, Joo-in.

673
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,370
Mr. Han prepared this breakfast
by himself.

674
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,130
It took him a minute.

675
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,390
Let's eat.

676
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,820
[I know you're mad at me,
but I even find that so sexy.]

677
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,150
Sit here, Master.

678
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,520
Sit down. It'll get cold. Hurry.

679
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,130
This looks like a big breakfast.

680
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,460
Gwang-ja, open wide.

681
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,130
What kind of indecency is this
at this sacred table?

682
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,490
-Are you jealous?
-Not at all.

683
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,300
Not at all.

684
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,870
Hey, Joo-in,
Mr. Han wants you to feed him.

685
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,800
Forget it. He's got hands.

686
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,880
Why do I have such normal hands?

687
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:58,410
Gwang-ja, why don't you stay here until
your dad approves of your relationship?

688
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,670
And Jae-hwan, you can stay too.

689
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,200
You're an angel, Ms. Oh.

690
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,650
You should discuss this with me
before making a decision.

691
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,460
Have you ever discussed anything?

692
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,860
And I'm the homeowner, Tenant.

693
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,350
That's correct.

694
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,660
I got a call from my dad yesterday.
He told me to come home.

695
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,890
I have to get his approval.

696
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,620
Call me if anything happens.

697
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,300
There's nothing I can't handle.

698
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,310
I just need to try hard.

699
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,540
Right?

700
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,940
Here. Open wide.

701
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,710
That'll get stuck in your throat.

702
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,700
Eat up.

703
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,760
Are you still mad at me?

704
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,680
He's trying so hard to please me.

705
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,520
Come out. Don't stand there.

706
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,040
Do you forgive me?

707
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,340
A handshake to express my apology.

708
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,350
Okay.

709
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,010
I accept.

710
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,330
-What's wrong?
-I think I have a cramp.

711
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,850
You're not fooling me.

712
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,500
It's real. I have carpal tunnel syndrome.

713
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:29,680
What is that?

714
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,040
When you do repetitive movements,
you get this syndrome.

715
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,140
It causes pain in my hands and wrist.

716
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,760
That's not good.
Your hands are so important.

717
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,090
That feels better.

718
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,940
Can you keep holding my hand?

719
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,920
But don't you need to see a doctor?

720
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,470
No, I don't need to.

721
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,220
Your hands are like healer's hands.

722
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,120
No, they aren't.
You just want to hold my hand.

723
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,950
Holding hands will reduce cortisol levels
and give you a steady heartbeat.

724
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,140
It'll make your skin clearer
and reduce body pain.

725
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,530
-It's a cure-all?
-Yes.

726
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,440
Do you want to make a bet?

727
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,930
-What kind of bet?
-Let's hold hands all day.

728
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,700
Whoever lets it go first, loses.

729
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,170
And what's the punishment?

730
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,580
The loser has to grant
a wish to the winner. How about it?

731
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,570
You're going to tap into
my competitive streak?

732
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,790
Fine. Let's do it.

733
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,470
Start.

734
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,240
Darn it.

735
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,780
Lie down on my lap.

736
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,080
I can do it myself.

737
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,110
My left hand is lonely. It wants to help.

738
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,710
All right. Let's see
how good of a helper it is.

739
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:48,930
Hurry.

740
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,690
Focus on applying the cucumbers.

741
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:15,340
How can I focus when you're
right in front of my eyes?

742
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,110
I see your point.

743
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,710
But why do you need these cucumbers?

744
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,610
My face feels puffy
after eating late at night.

745
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,290
You need some bloat.

746
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:27,440
People look at you too much
because you're so pretty.

747
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:28,910
That's not good for me.

748
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,500
How can you change just like that?

749
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,440
Because you make

750
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,710
the impossible possible. Only you.

751
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,270
That makes me a goddess then.

752
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,080
Yes, you're a goddess.

753
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,400

Do you have any idea what he meant?

It was my first time

I confessed my love to.

But you're saying that

810
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,070
You told me that you had
a secret you couldn't tell me.

811
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,000
Is that it?

812
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,930
Are you

813
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,650
thinking about leaving me?

814
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:52,570
[Oh! Master]
