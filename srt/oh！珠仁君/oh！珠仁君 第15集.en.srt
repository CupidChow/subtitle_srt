[So it's upsetting that
he's being accused of plagiarism.]

163
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,620
You can see for yourself
when the show premieres.

164
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,550
It's a totally different story.

165
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,210

the writer. Wish her success.]

Okay.

I understand.

Ms. Kim wants to talk to you
after the shooting ends.

177
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,100
-I'll go alone.
-I'll go with you.

178
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,490
I wasn't able to talk you out of
doing this show.

179
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,680
Sorry for putting you
in an awkward position.

180
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,040
Did you tell Bi-soo
you were doing a live broadcast?

181
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,260
No.

182
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,320
I did it on my own.

183
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,770
-Hello, Director Jeong.
-Yu-jin?

184

Hello.

185
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,050
I came to check on Joo-in.

186
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,600
We'll leave you two alone.

187
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,570
Your live broadcast is in the news.

188
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,050
-Already?
-Did you have to do it?

189
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,860
Bi-soo didn't plagiarize anyone.
That's the truth.

190
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,300
I checked the novelist
who's accusing Bi-soo.

191
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,810
He has published two novels so far.

192
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,790
This isn't the first time he accused
someone of plagiarism.

193
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,260
How do we handle this?

194
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,700
His accusation is groundless.

195
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,430
Since you defended Bi-soo,
things will settle down.

196
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,690
Bi-soo will be so grateful
when he learns what you did.

197
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,619
I didn't do it for him. I did it for you.

198
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,580
[In the trailer, there's a scene]

199
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,290
[where the main characters go camping
in a tent. That's based on a date I had.]

200
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,070
[I told a guy I wanted to see the stars.
He said he'd pluck them for me.]

201
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,810
[He stuck star stickers
on the ceiling of the tent.]

202
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,830
[They weren't real stars.]

203
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,570
[But they were better
than the real thing.]

204
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,590
Because it was such a thoughtful touch.

Why are you telling this to me now?

Because I didn't want
to hurt you like this.

You must have been terrified,

I don't know how to handle this.

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,450
Never mind.

229

You can say his name.

230
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,920
Mom, actually,

231
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,790
I'm in love with him.

232
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,020
I never stopped loving him.

If that's how you feel,
you can get back together.

237
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,990
it'll be more painful than it is now.

238

Love isn't always rosy.
There are pitfalls.

239
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,480
But hiding your feelings is worse

240
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,680
than the heartache you're suffering from.

241

Okay.

You're really going to leave?
Even if I ask you to stay?

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,120
Yes.

246
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,350
Do you know how I felt

when I read the script?

248
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,410
It took my breath away.

249
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,900
Sometimes, it made me cry.

250
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,260
The lines were like a love letter
sent from you.

251
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,210
I could feel your love
throughout the script.

252
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,530
You don't want to leave.

253
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,430
I know you want to stay with me.

254
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,670
You can fool me,

255
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,020
but you can't fool yourself.

256
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,150
Not having you by my side

257
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,160
frightens me. But I don't want to
think about it right now.

258
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,410
I only want to focus on

259
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,140
how much I love you.

260
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,330
Spend your remaining time on me.

261
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,620
That's what you can do for me.

262
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,380
It's the gift I want the most.

263
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,020
I love you.

264
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,780
Thanks to Ms. Oh,
Bi-soo isn't taking any heat anymore.

You have skills.

267
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,240
I'm not an amateur at playing pool.

268
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,260
-It's your turn now.
-All right.

269
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,360
You need to spread your legs a bit more.

270
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,470
Your shoulders need to be
aligned with the cue.

271
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,030
-Like this?
-Hold it here.

272
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,410
Hold it lightly.

273
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,180
Aim at the center of the yellow ball.

274
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,240
Pull back after you hit it.

275
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,140
Oh, it didn't work.

276
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,460
Is it not working out for us either?

277
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,650
You told me last time...

278
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,660
I don't have a chance, right?

279
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,300
Mr. Yoo.

280
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,330
This is called the "kiss".

281
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,490
-What?
-When the ball goes off course.

282
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,840
You call it a "kiss".

283
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,790
I never said I didn't want to date you.

284
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,280
I merely said that you could

285
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,170
find a better woman than me.

286
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,630
You're a true pro.

287
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,560
A man in white. You were hit by a car.

288
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,620
I don't get it.

289
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,030
Even though you explained it,

290
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,470
I still don't believe it.
Even if I witnessed it all, I'm not sure.

291
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,030
But

292
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,140
I believe your heart.

293
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:57,480
You don't want to waste the precious time
you have left by being sad.

294
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,500
So this is what I'm thinking.

295
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:07,300
When you're dating someone,
you only have eyes for that person.

296
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,620
But after a breakup,

297
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,880
you stop seeing that person.
Then they're as good as invisible to you.

298
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,740
Even if you were to vanish one day,

299
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,340
I'll remember your love.

300
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,610
Sorry.

301
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,350
You don't need to be sorry.

302
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,300
We can't change the ending.

303
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,150
So let's

304
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,240
just focus on the present.

305
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,190
You're next to me right now.

306
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,630
You don't have permission
to get up before I do.

307
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,350
I wanted to brew you some coffee.

308
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,570
Your morning coffee.

309
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,580
Smells good, right?

310
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,820
Not as good as how you smell.

311
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,650
Oh, my diaphragm.
Why are my hiccups not stopping?

312
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,580
Hold your breath.

313
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,440
Then swallow.

314
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,360
-It's not working.
-I wonder why.

315
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,460
You have to hold your breath.

316
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,600
Drink some coffee.

317
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,160
It's not working.

318
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,910
We'll have another go at it tonight.

319
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,420
It stopped.

320
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,990
What?

321
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,540
-I'm going to shower.
-Not now.

322
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,140
What are you imagining?

323
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,370
I take a shower in the morning.

324
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,370
-Oh, gosh.
-Gosh what?

325
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,340
Someone wrote a comment attacking Ms. Oh.

326
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,610
[I think Joo-in and Bi-soo are dating.]

327
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,700
The commenter says Ms. Oh defended Mr. Han

328
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,330
[That's why Joo-in is defending Bi-soo.]

329
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,330
because the two are dating.

330
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,060
Based on what?

331
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,580
In the post, it says Mr. Han rescued

332
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,840
[I was a staffer
at the Asia Drama Awards.]

333
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,360
Ms. Oh when she was locked in a closet.

334
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,750
And there were multiple
witnesses at the scene.

335
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,770
This will hurt Joo-in's image.

336
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,620
And also our brand.

337
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,560
I should've taken swift action. I'm sorry.

338
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
Can we take it down?

339
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,150
We can delete the post,
but it's already been widely shared.

340
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,660
I don't want to go.

341
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,230
I don't want to see you go.

342
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,090
-I'll do my best today.
-Okay.

343
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,700
I should've become a show producer.

344
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,380
That way I could be with you all day.

345
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,450
Good morning, Gwang-ja.

346
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,890
[Sorry. Thank you. I love...]

347
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,810
[I love you.]

348
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,390
Thank you.

349
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,370
For being my last love.

350
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,170
Where are you going?

351
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,250
-You're back together.
-We weren't fighting in the first place.

352
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,190
Stay right next to her.

353
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,370
-Why?
-You look so radiant.

354
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,640
I was always radiant.

355
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,620
I need to go somewhere so watch my store.

356
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,320
You don't even pay me a salary.
I'm not an indentured servant.

357
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,590
I'm going to call the Labor Department
on you one day.

358
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,420
They don't even know
what they're talking about.

359
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,610
I'm so upset!

360
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,040
What's wrong?

361
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,320
The crew thinks you're dating Mr. Han.
That's all they're talking about.

362
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,300
Me and Bi-soo?

363
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,530
I wouldn't be mad if it were true,
you know.

364
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,420
It's over between you and him.

365
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,100
You don't want to be reminded of it.

366
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,790
Oh, I know.

367
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,070
What should we do?
The rumor is spreading fast.

368
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,940
Gwang-ja, I have something to tell you.

369
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,100
Wait a minute. Your voice just changed.

370
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,300
I'm seeing Bi-soo again.

371
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,980
What?

372
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,320
What?

373
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,610
Do you serve sweet coffee drinks?

374
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,310
No, we don't.
We do serve bitter coffee though.

375
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,860
Bitter coffee is all right.

376
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,210
Oh, really?

377
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,640
Then brew it yourself. It's self-service.

378
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,000
You don't do things in moderation, do you?

379
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,020
-What are you talking about?
-Joo-in looks

380
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,210
so cute and pretty
when she talks about you.

381
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,900
I can't win her heart. You beat me.

382
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,080
But when I see her cry,

383
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,070
it really breaks my heart.

384
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,370
I'd like to beat you into pulp

385
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,470
so that you won't be able to
show your face.

386
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,480
You'll beat me into pulp?

387
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,840
Joo-in will not forgive you
if you were to do that.

388
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,570
What? You two are back together again?

389
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,080
Come with me to a cafe with a view.

390
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,790
Yes! The snack truck is here.

391
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,140
Let's go.

392
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,730
-Coffee?
-Yes.

393
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,890
-Do they have churros?
-Probably.

394
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,960
How can people talk about you
behind your back?

395
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,730
That's so rude.

396
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,830
-Thanks for the churros, Joo-in.
-Thanks.

397
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,510
-Thanks, Joo-in.
-Thank you.

398
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,150
I think the snack truck
came because of you.

399
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,180
Enjoy sweet churros.

400
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,860
Sugar isn't good for you. Enjoy a coffee.

401
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,750
Bi-soo heart Yu-jin?

402
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,800
[We support Oh Joo-in,
Bi-soo and Yu-jin, best friends]

403
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,450
Oh, my gosh. What are they doing together?

404
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,810
-Thank you.
-Have a churro.

405
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,080
They chose coffee.

406
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,050
Don't gloat.

407
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,490
Everyone likes coffee.

408
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,900
You insisted that your name comes first.
So I got dibs on giving out coffee.

409
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,120
What's going on?

410
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,480
Guess Joo-in wasn't
cheating on her boyfriend.

411
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,210
-They're best friends.
-Really?

412
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,720
Why didn't you give me a heads up?

413
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,860
I almost cried.

414
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,100
By the way, the heart symbol
between our names

415
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,250
was a mistake made by the printers.

416
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,060
I kind of liked it.

417
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,720
Well, it wasn't that bad.

418
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,350
Thanks for today.

419
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,830
It broke the ice on the set.

420
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,600
And also put down the rumors.

421
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,580
It was Yu-jin's idea.

422
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,510
I'm indebted to him again.

423
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,770
Then repay me.

424
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,210
Okay. What do you want?

425
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,940
First, let me sleep over.

426
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,120
What?

427
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,400
Second, let's drop all formalities
for an hour.

428
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,090
You want to be frank with me?

429
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,110
Seems like you want to criticize me.

430
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,960
You owe me one more favor. So why not?

431
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:51,930
No.

432
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,500
-One hour is too long.
-Then how about 30 minutes?

433
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,320
-Okay?
-It doesn't sound like any fun.

434
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,170
I think it'll be interesting.

435
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,470
Start.

436
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,710
Hey, Bi-soo.
What's with the scowling face?

437
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,110
You'll get crow's feet around your eyes.

438
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,000
Hey, Bi-soo? "Scowl"?

439
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,310
I'm young, rich, tall, and handsome.

440
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,820
Admit it.

441
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm all of that and also cute and sexy.

442
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,600
Joo-in doesn't like such traits. Right?

443
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,020
-What on earth?
-Hey.

444
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,080
Did you apply hand cream? Smells good.

445
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,680
Keep your hands to yourself.

446
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,360
You'd like to twist my arm, right?

447
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,920
How about we arm wrestle?

448
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,120
Game on.

449
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,290
Don't shift your elbow.

450
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,470
Ready.

451
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,340
-Ready.
-Come on.

452
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,890
Go!

453
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,880
What on earth?

454
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,730
Hey, Bi-soo. Are you even trying?

455
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:04,290
How can you protect Joo-in
when you're this weak?

456
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,740
I don't exercise my arms
because I need to save them for writing.

457
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,030
What? That's a foul.

458
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,920
You used two hands first.

459
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,720
Joo-in, that's my girl.

460
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,270
I won. Don't be so cocky from now on.

461
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,880
It's not easy pretending to lose.

462
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,160
You needed the win more than me.

463
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:31,590
Good luck.

464
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,490
You really know how to
get under a person's skin.

465
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,960
Is your wrist okay?

466
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,190
-No, it's not okay.
-You need your hands to write hit shows.

467
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,290
-You can't get them hurt.
-Right.

468
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,310
What are you two doing?

469
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,930
I need to talk to you.

470
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,390
-What did I do?
-Go ahead.

471
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,280
You're dead meat now.

472
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,960
My Gwang-ja.

473
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,270
Is there something you have to say?

474
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,750
Jae-hwan,

475
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,150
my dad wants to meet you.
He wants me to set the date.

476
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,240
He does?

477
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,100
Finally, your dad has accepted me
as a future son-in-law.

478
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,870
It's not good news.

479
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,460
Why not?

480
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,430
Well, I don’t have a lot saved up.
And I'm still building my career.

481
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,780
So I don't have much to show, but...

482
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,710
What are you talking about, Jae-hwan?

483
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,520
It's not about those things.

484
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,570
