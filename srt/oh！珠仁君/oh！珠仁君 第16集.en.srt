He's...

7
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,020
What's the matter, Bi-soo?

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,530
Do you know who this person is?

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,220
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

10
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,890
I have a meeting with Dae-young
and I'm running late.

11
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,950
I need to get up first.
I'll see you at home.

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,960
Good-bye, Mrs. Oh.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,390
- Bye. Come again.
- I will.

14
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,220
Bi-soo!

15
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,950
Is everything alright?

16
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,350
Sure. I promise.

(Living Funeral

Who are you?

19
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,220
I'm here to save your life.

20
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,690
When you had the accident,
I told you who I was.

21
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,160
49 days from now,
you'll vanish completely from this world.

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,460
How do you know my mom?

23
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,660
Why did you show up in my life?

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,820
Who are you?

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,950

26
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,950
Bi-soo?

27
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,420
Where did he go?

28
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,430

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,660
Bi-soo...

31
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,290
Bi-soo.

32
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,750
Oh, you came.

33
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,390
Where were you?
You left all the lights on.

34
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,990
You're making it hard for me
to even use the bathroom.

35
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,060
From now on, you can't

36
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,560
do what you want on your own.

37
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,019
You have to report to me
on your whereabouts.

38
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,190
I won't forget that.

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,790
Did you go to your meeting with Mr. Yoo?

40
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,990
Yeah.

41
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,850
You're lying.

42
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,590
I talked to Gwang-ja and she told me.

43
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,990
Mr. Yoo wasn't in his office all day.

44
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,159
We don't always have meetings
in his office.

45
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,790
That photo bothered you, right?

46
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,390
Who is he? You look so surprised to see it.

47
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,420
He's the person

48
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,490
who saved me when I got in an accident.

49
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,220
The guy in white?

50
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Yeah.

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,830
If your mother kept this photo for so long,

52
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,590
he must be someone important...

53
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,790
I see a resemblance between you
and this man.

54
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,290
You do?

55
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,760
Now I've got my energy back.

56
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,320
Where are you, Bi-soo?

57
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,460
You went to visit your mother's grave?

58
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,650
I suddenly missed my mom.

59
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,960
I told you to report to me
where you're going.

60
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
How could you go alone?

61
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,190
Sorry.

62
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,390
I miss you so much, Bi-soo.

63
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,090
You can't live without me, can you?

64
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,690
You love me to death, don't you?

65
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,990
Yes, you're acting so adorable.

66
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,790
Oh, I have to go on the set.

67
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,350
I wish I could keep talking to you.

68
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,030
Go and show everyone you're a top actress.

69
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,720
Bye.

70
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,120
Did you see Joo-in's expression?

71
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,190
She's all smiles.

72
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,990
Joo-in is doing fine.

73
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,960
Actually...

74
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,690
She's pretending to be alright.

75
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,130
How are you doing, Mom?

76
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,990
Everything AOK?

77
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,520
In a little while

78
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,420
I'll be joining you.

79
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,390
But you know...

80
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,550
Is the man in this photo

81
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,090
the person I think he is?

82
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,160
Bi-soo.

83
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,090
Sorry, Bi-soo.

84
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,160
Why are you sorry?

85
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,160
How do you know my mom?

86
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,390
It can't be...

87
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,590
Are you...

88
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,920
Ji-wook, duck.

89
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,990
Ji-wook.

90
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,950
Hang on.

91
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,250
Stay with me.

92
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,060
Donâ€™t die.

93
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,490
Ji-wook!

94
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,790
Joo-in, you can stop now.
The scene is over.

95
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,360
He can't die. Not him.

96
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,790
So when the truck hit me,
I was supposed to have died.

97
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,890
But you extended my life?

98
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,150
I wanted you to be with Hae-jin
until she passed.

99
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,150
I couldn't be with her
till death do us part.

100
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,990
Thank you for

101
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,250
being by her side in my place.

102
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,250
Thanks to you...

103
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
I was able to be with Mom till she died

104
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,820
and also meet Joo-in

105
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,420
and fall in love.

106
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,890
Thanks,

107
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,490
Dad.

108
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,190
Good job!

109
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,190
I see that you showed off
your acting skills today.

110
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,960
Of course, I did. Who am I?

111
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,190
Did you exhaust yourself?

112
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,490
You look tired.

113
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,730
You seem to be in a good mood

114
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,090
after visiting your mom's grave.

115
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,020
Something good happened to me.

116
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,290
I took a brief nap by the river.

117
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,290
And my dad appeared in my dreams.

118
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,490
Your dad?

119
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,560
Yeah.

120
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,330
I was hit by a truck

121
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,060
just like you.

122
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,090
(I love you, Hae-jin. Will you marry me?)

123
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,030
My dad told me that he never got

124
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,460
the chance to say I love you and
ask my mom to marry him.

125
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,250
That was his biggest regret.

126
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,520
He didn't want to see me die like that, too.

127
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,450
So he extended my life.

(Student card/Medical School)

129
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,260
He didn't want me to die
without discovering real love.

130
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,860
He wished I would learn how to love.

131
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,790
It wasn't a dream, right?

132
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,420
- Huh?
- You met him for real, didn't you?

133
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,990
I believe you and what you just said.

134
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,290
(Episode 16 The End)

135
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,290
You finally finished it.

136
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,490
I know.

137
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,290
We have to celebrate with
a ritual on such a momentous day.

138
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,150
Please make our show a hit.

139
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,820
I created the show so it'll be a bona fide hit.

140
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,450
- Since you're a hitmaker, huh?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,130
I'm counting on you
to make it come to life.

142
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,890
I'll give my best performance.

143
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,730
Pick a scene and I can act it.

144
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,250
Randomly flip to any page.
Every page has great scenes.

145
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,360
Okay. Let's see...

146
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,590
This is your last mission.
Failure is unacceptable as always.

147
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,790
What if I fail?

148
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,830
You want to know?

149
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,490
No need to. I never fail.

150
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,920
What? That hurt.

151
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,560
I went easy on you.

152
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,120
Let's go to the next scene.
The one where I get revenge.

153
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,590
Do you know that it's been 49 days
since we first met?

154
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,050
What? You've been counting the days?

155
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,790
Those 49 days were very special to me.

156
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,330
That's not in the script.

157
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,220
Because I learned

158
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,630
how to love and be loved

159
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,050
despite not knowing
when it'll be my last day.

160
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,220
Being with you in the present
is what's important.

161
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,790
That's right. Stay together with me.

162
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,350
Where are you, Gwang-ja?

163
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,220
I noticed you coming in.
You're my type.

164
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,450
What?

165
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,160
Me?

166
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,160
I'm sorry but I have a girlfriend.

167
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,190
How about we have some coffee?

168
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,930
Caffeine makes my heart rate go up.

169
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,920
What about ice cream?

170
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,490
No, I don't like sugary foods.

171
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,620
- Can I give you my number?
- No.

172
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,090
I donâ€™t want to get in trouble
with my girlfriend.

173
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,360
Is your girlfriend hotter than me?

174
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,490
Words can't express her looks.

175
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,530
She's a ray of light.

176
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,520
My Jae-hwan.

177
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,450
What is going on?

178
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,160
Oh gosh. I'm lucky to have
a boyfriend like you.

179
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,190
I have to admit, he's a keeper.

180
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,960
Most guys would fall for it.

181
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,890
You know each other?

182
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,859
She's my cousin.

183
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,690
My dad said he had to test you.

184
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,550
I'm sorry, Jae-hwan.

185
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,089
- What?
- I approve!

186
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,990
- Who is he?
- He's my dad.

187
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,690
I also approve.

188
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,550
- Who is she?
- She's my aunt.

189
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,020
I approve, too.

190
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,520
- Then who is he?
- Another cousin.

191
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,620
I'll get right to the point.
I approve of you dating my daughter.

192
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,090
I have your permission?

193
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,520
Wow! Everyone celebrate with me!

194
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,690
Her dad approves of me!

195
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,220
I got to watch you give
a great performance.

196
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,460
You weren't so bad yourself.

197
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,090
We should take a photo.

198
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,550
Sure. A precious memento.

199
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,690
Three, two, one.

200
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,220
Nice pose.

201
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,290
- One more.
- Three, two, one.

202
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,390
Got it.

203
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,880
Hold on.

204
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,350
Title. Joo-in is levitating.

205
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,890
It really looks like I'm levitating.

206
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,220
Shouldn't you see Joo-in
before you catch your flight?

207
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,260
I can see her like this.

208
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,650
But it'll be a final good-bye.

209
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,220
Yu-jin!

210
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,960
How did she know I was leaving today?

211
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,790
You were going to leave
without saying good-bye?

212
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,720
We'll see each other again.

213
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,520
Don't skip your meals.

214
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,860
And come and visit whenever
you feel like it.

215
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,660
Okay. You pat people so hard.

216
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,730
You want to get a strong pat on the back?

217
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,290
I'll get going.

218
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll go with you to the airport.

219
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,990
Just stay right there.

220
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,320
I said stay.

221
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,790
What?

222
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,660
What?

223
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,760
If you get any closer,
I might get used to it.

224
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,720
So stay right there.

225
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,890
Take care, Yu-jin!

226
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,450
"Guitarist, Female Killer." Excellent.

227
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,190
We just have to wait for it to be a hit.

228
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,190
Such superb writing. You finished it so quickly.

229
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,090
No one could pull it off except you.

230
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,350
I know that

231
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,090
without you, it would have been

232
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,450
impossible to pull off.

233
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,890
That's a strange remark.

234
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,460
What Bi-soo just said.

235
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,390
I know.

236
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,690
What is this feeling?

237
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,050
Did you jump to another agency?

238
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,590
What is it? Tell me.

239
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,820
I'm going to take
a long break from writing.

240
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,290
Oh, you almost scared me.

241
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,330
Go ahead.

242
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,430
Take six months off.

243
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm going to travel.

244
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,780
You will? For how long?

245
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,720
I don't know.

246
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,560
I might never come back.

247
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,550
Bi-soo.

248
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,950
Don't argue with him.
Writing means a lot to Bi-soo.

249
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,950
Sure.

250
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,660
Take as long as you want.

251
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,190
Give Jae-hwan a chance to write scripts.

252
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,590
Give him his first show.

253
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,550
Bi-soo, I'm not ready yet.

254
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,820
I don't know if I have the skills.

255
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,520
Jae-hwan still has a long way to go.

256
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,590
He's my protege.

257
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,220
Let him create a show. That's an order.

258
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,360
This USB thumb drive contains my formula.

259
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,950
What's in it?

260
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,750
- My formula in creating hit shows.
- Bi-soo!

261
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,460
Did you prepare that just for me?

262
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,660
Don't share it with anyone.
It's for your eyes only.

263
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,130
Make use of it as you please.

264
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,890
Of course, I will.

265
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,290
Bi-soo.

266
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,920
- I love you!
- Get off me.

267
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Are you alright?

268
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,420
I'm your new TV writer, Jung Jae-hwan.

269
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,830
Yes!

270
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,030
Welcome, Joo-in.

271
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,620
This home is always ready to welcome you.

272
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,490
Exercise every day.

273
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,220
To stay healthy.

274
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,560
(Exercise every day to stay healthy)

275
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,590
Don't get milk on your mouth.

276
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,060
It makes me want to kiss you.

277
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,630
(Don't get milk on your mouth.
It makes me want to kiss you)

278
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,550
Hang out with friends instead of the teddy bear.

279
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,420
Because you're brighter than

280
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,390
the stars I plucked for you.

281
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,450
I didn't ask you to wipe that.

282
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,860
There's something you feel guilty
about, isn't there?

283
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,130
Chang-gyu.

284
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,920
- Why you?
- Thanks

285
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,390
for being my friend for all these years.

286
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,120
That's right.

287
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm going to suffer for many more years

288
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,930
because of you. My young, arrogant friend.

289
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,230
If I hadn't cried in your listening room,

290
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,360
we would have never met.

291
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,260
We wouldn't be friends today.

292
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,930
It was my luck that I cried there.

293
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,830
You like me that much, huh?

294
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,490
Good!

295
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,020
You really like me.

296
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,620
You told me before

297
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,960
that a record with lots of scratches

298
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,460
is a "good" one.

299
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,890
It should be a bad record.

300
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,920
I thought it was strange
when you called it "good."

301
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,420
That's life.

302
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,590
Exactly.

303
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,320
Even though it's in bad condition,

304
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,890
the record still plays fine.

305
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,490
The same way that life is fine
even through hardships.

306
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,620
Thanks to you, I learned a life lesson.

307
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,490
So meeting you was "good."

308
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,130
Bi-soo, you're a good friend, too.

309
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,560
What are you doing?

310
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,430
(Player Bi-soo)

311
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,650
(Player Bi-soo)
What is this?

312
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,020
So you saw my notes?

313
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,990
I indulged myself

314
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,520
in your love.

315
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,630
My mom gave this to you
so it belongs to you.

316
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,730
Without putting it on for me?

317
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,660
This is how you accept a ring.

318
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,450
And this is how you kiss.

319
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,290
- Joo-in.
- Hi.

320
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,890
You must be tired after
shooting action scenes today.

321
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,250
I'm alright.

322
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,920
You're wearing a new ring.

323
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,060
Bi-soo gave it to me.

324
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,460
I once lived together with my boyfriend.

325
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,990
We were inseparable.

326
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,490
But after we broke up,

327
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,820
the emptiness was unbearable.

328
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,960
When I see Bi-soo,

329
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,460
he looks like someone
who'll leave you at anytime.

330
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,660
That's

331
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,220
why I didn't think he was right for you.

332
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,490
I know you were looking out for me.

333
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,090
I thought a lot about it.

334
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,560
Even if he leaves one day,

335
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,690
he's with me right now.

336
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,990
When it's over,

337
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,850
I'm going to accept it.

338
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,190
Did you come to pick up Joo-in?

339
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm going to be her chauffeur because
she had a strenuous shoot.

340
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,790
Not in front of my agent.

341
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,550
Don't be shy.

342
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,730
- Is it uncomfortable?
- Not at all.

343
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,750
I cried while reading
the final episode you wrote.

344
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,560
I usually don't.

345
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,290
I usually don't write tearjerkers either.

346
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,460
I'll get going then.

347
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,620
Bye.

348
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,850
Huh? They're holding hands.

349
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,720
Why are you hesitating?

350
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,330
No, I wasn't.

351
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,760
Then let's show everyone.

352
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,990
You're mine and I'm yours.

353
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,330
- Good-bye.
- What the?

354
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,060
- Congrats.
- They're a couple?

355
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,760
You should've let me treat you to lunch.

356
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,790
That's okay. There's always a next time.

357
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,990
Oh gosh. I'm so sorry.

358
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,220
Let me pay for the dry cleaner's bill.

359
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,860
That's okay. It's fine. I can handle it myself.

360
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,360
- But still.
- I'm fine.

361
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
I'm sorry.

362
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,490
Are you okay?
That was a surprise, wasn't it?

363
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,320
Oh my. You got all wet.

364
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,020
It's nothing.

365
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,120
It's refreshing.

366
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,430
I like the cold.

367
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,350
That's why I only drink ice coffee.

368
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,620
It's my go-to drink.

369
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,690
Ice coffee in any weather.

370
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,590
That's not true.

371
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,590
You drink hot coffee all the time.

372
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,560
That's...

373
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,220
Will you be my boyfriend?

374
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,960
What?

375
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,950
You don't like it?

376
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,590
Well, in that case...

377
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,820
Of course, not.

378
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,090
What are you doing?

379
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,620
What? Really?

380
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,160
I'm overjoyed. This is great.

381
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,060
Really.

382
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,480
Hurray!

383
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,290
Why are you staring?

384
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,750
Because you're pretty.

385
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,560
When was I the prettiest?

386
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,690
Every second.

387
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,590
When did you hate me?

388
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,690
Never.

389
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,850
When do you think of me?

390
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,290
Always.

391
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,360
How many times did I make you upset?

392
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,060
Many times.

393
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,460
If you were to highlight my best trait,

394
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,250
which one would it be?

395
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,830
You have so many.

396
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,990
If I had to choose.
You're a world-class beauty.

397
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,090
Wow.

398
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,220
What did you gain and lose
while dating me?

399
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,490
I gained love.

400
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,650
I lost my sanity.

401
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,690
What about you?

402
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,890
I gained love.

403
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,050
And I didn't lose anything.

404
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,390
Come on. That's a lie.

405
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,860
I really didn't.

406
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,550
Is that the end of Q&A?

407
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,390
Yes.

408
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,120
Looks like you still have more questions.

409
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,220
Will we be okay

410
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,890
on the day you disappear?

411
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,620
Sure.

412
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,780
How can you be so sure?

413
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,450
Because...

414
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,930
I know how I'll vanish.

415
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,620
How will it happen?

416
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,850
If I tell you know, it won't be fun.

417
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,750
When will you tell me?

418
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,920
Later.

419
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,630
Later.

420
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,190
But it won't change anything
between us, right?

421
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,650
Even if you disappear.

422
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,720
I'll always remember you.

423
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,550
You surprised me.

424
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,390
What were you thinking?

425
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,150
I was thinking about you.

426
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,890
Don't think about anyone else.

427
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,560
I don't have time to do that.

428
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,750
Stop staring aimlessly. Get up.

429
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,820
We've got a lot to do.

430
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,190
We have to move quickly today.

431
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,320
What are we doing?

432
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,490
Starting with that.

433
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,750
Follow me.

434
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,930
What's the plan?

435
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,250
Let's play an old couple who
has been married for 40 years.

436
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,220
Time moves faster for us?

437
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,890
You trust me, right?

438
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,150
No.

439
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,020
- You have to trust me.
- I don't want to trust you.

440
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,820
Oh my gosh.

441
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,230
Even your wrinkles look cool.

442
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,220
I don't think so.

443
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,120
- Your reaction says the opposite.
- No, you really look cool.

444
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,890
- I look silly, don't I?
- No.

445
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,290
Stay still now.

446
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,850
Go to town.

447
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,430
Oh, you're confident.

448
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,560
You gave me so much heartbreak
when you were younger.

449
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,220
I got these wrinkles because of you.

450
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,730
You're still witty even as a grandma.

451
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,150
Let's have fun like this

452
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,050
even after we grow old together...

453
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,450
It's nice.

454
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,590
I can see how you'll look in old age.

455
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,920
It's thanks to you.

456
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,630
You always tell me I'm pretty and cute.

457
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,890
And that's how we grow old.

458
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,890
Oh, no.

459
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,120
Sorry, Joo-in.

460
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,890
Do we have to wear this?

461
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,160
What's the matter?

462
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,250
I want everyone to know

463
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,190
that we're dating.

464
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,090
But people are staring at us.

465
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,820
- You look cute together.
- Nice.

466
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,630
Don't take pictures.
That's an invasion of privacy.

467
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,390
- Donâ€™t.
- Wait a minute.

468
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,090
- Hold this part.
- Why?

469
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,960
What are you doing?

470
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,320
- Take all the pictures you want.
- What are you doing?

471
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,720
- Jae-hwan, smile.
- Kimchi.

472
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,950
(Marvelous. If you donâ€™t enter, you'll regret it)

473
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,190
No.

474
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,150
- What's there to see?
- I'm going in.

475
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,220
Pick three tarot cards

476
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,460
while thinking of the man you love in your heart.

477
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:36,190
From left to right, is the present and future.

478
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,460
I can't wait to find out.
Please flip them.

479
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,720
It doesn't look good.

480
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,160
That's why I donâ€™t believe in
tarot card readings.

481
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,420
You read them left to right from my side.

482
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,250
The cards you've chosen aren't good ones.

483
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,990
But their meanings are
reversed on my side.

484
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,160
This man does not reveal his feelings.

485
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,650
He's fallen in love.

486
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,590
Oh, that's correct.

487
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,820
This second tarot card says

488
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,650
you'll have many fun memories together.

489
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,620
It is fun.

490
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,160
What about the last card?

491
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,260
He only

492
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:39,330
has love for you, Joo-in.

493
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,750
Oh gosh.

494
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,560
He'll only love one person to death.

495
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,330
You'll be happy.

496
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,520
Since you have someone like him.

497
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,550
My love by my side?

498
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:27,820
The day all my love leaves.

499
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:35,190
When I'm with you as we laugh.

500
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:44,550
My foolish ambition and
these lingering feelings.

501
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,490
And I wonder if you will be there.

502
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,790
Are you frightened?

503
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,590
You don't have much time left now.

504
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,790
There's nothing to be scared of.

505
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,120
I told you that I know how

506
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,650
my last moments will unfold.

507
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,490
Close your eyes.

508
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,860
I'll tell you.

509
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,530
Bi-soo!

510
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,550
Joo-in!

511
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,990
When I didn't disappear even
when the clock struck 12,

512
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,360
I was surprised and so was Joo-in.

513
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,190
How did this happen?

514
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,090
But I didn't understand.

515
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,020
The next day...

516
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,360
And the next...

517
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,960
And the day after that...

518
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,150
I didn't vanish.

519
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,220
We spent every day together
and stayed in love.

520
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,650
That's how

521
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,860
we spent spring, summer, autumn
and winter together.

522
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,230
Then

523
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,860
spring came again.

524
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,890
Three, two, one.

525
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:45,220
Happy birthday to you.

526
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,920
Happy birthday to Bi-soo.

527
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,230
As the seasons change,

528
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,690
we are surrounded by dear friends

529
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,650
and live happily together

530
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,490
every day.

531
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,830
But Bi-soo...

532
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,190
So how do you stay with us
and not disappear?

533
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,930
Actually, I misunderstood his words.

534
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,290
There's no point in living
if you're not in love.

535
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,390
That sounds silly.
You said I would die. Explain that.

536
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,920
49 years

537
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,920
from now...

538
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,320
you'll vanish completely from this world.

539
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,090
Huh? What did you say?

540
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,990
The birds interrupted while he was talking.

541
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,060
49 years

542
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,460
from now,
you'll vanish completely from this world.

543
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,590
- What's that?
- Then these cats interrupted him.

544
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,890
Could you repeat that? I didn't hear you.

545
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,050
You'll...

546
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,520
When will I vanish?

547
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,820
- You're going to vanish.
- I misheard him.

548
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,190
When will I vanish again?

549
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,690
Thanks to that.

550
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,820
We'll be together for 49 years

551
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,390
and every day will feel like our last one.

552
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,390
I like that ending.

553
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,720
What do you want to do now?

554
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:21,920
Me?

555
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,090
I don't want to do anything.
I just want to rest my head in your arms.

556
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,950
I want to look at you.

557
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,190
Thanks.

558
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,390
You're forbidden from saying thanks.

559
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,330
Can't you give me a pass?

560
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,920
I'll let you just this time.

561
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,350
Thanks.

562
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,260
For entering my life.

563
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,720
Thanks.

564
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,290
For making me into a mature man.

565
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,820
Thanks.

566
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,790
For teaching me what love is.

567
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,890
Thanks.

568
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,660
For being

569
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,020
my girl.

570
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:25,530
I love you.

571
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,190
I love you, Joo-in.

572
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,390
If I miss you...

573
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,020
When I miss you, what should I do?

574
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,760
Wait.

575
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,460
Bi-soo...

576
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,190
Bi-soo...

577
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,060
Bi-soo...

578
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,230
Bi-soo!

579
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,920
Bi-soo!

580
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,920
There are many incredible things
happening around us.

581
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,760
Love is something that is most incredible.

582
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,860
Love makes everything possible.

583
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,320
It'll even make you believe
what is unimaginable.

584
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,090
Seems like you're in love with someone.

585
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,860
Yes, I am.

586
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,960
He's always in my heart.

587
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,020
Is he...

588
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,220
That's the end of the interview.

589
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

590
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,750
(Yu-jin)
When are you coming?

591
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,560
I'm on my way.

592
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,320
Hurry up.

593
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,860
Of course.

594
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,130
(Guitarist, Female Killer 2
Episode 1 Draft)

595
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,550
How long must you work there?

596
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,320
I can only write scripts in this space.

597
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,730
You sure are Bi-soo's protege.

598
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,920
You emulate even his quirks.

599
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,120
Honey, let's go.

600
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,850
It's already time?

601
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:43,450
- Let's hurry.
- Hey, Jae-hwan.

602
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,320
Take your laptop with you.

603
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,250
I'm going to be back soon anyway.

604
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,890
Bye-bye.

605
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,120
Careful now.

606
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,560
Jae-hwan.

607
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,990
Why are they sleeping here
when they have their own apartment?

608
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,760
Oh, man.

609
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,360
They're so irritating.

610
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,950
I'm sick and tired.

611
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,150
A cup of coffee is what you need.

612
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,220
Oh, Lee-na.

613
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,660
Seeing you energizes me.

614
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,950
Dae-young, you wooed me
with your "ice coffee" act.

615
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,530
I shouldn't have fell for it.

616
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,920
I'm so happy that you did.

617
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,720
Yesterday's 368th-day anniversary was nice.

618
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:30,950
It's been a while since season 1
of Guitarist, Female Killer aired.

619
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,420
Despite that,

620
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,520
many fans of the show still talk about it.

621
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,790
I feel so grateful.

622
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,220
To commemorate the show,

623
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,220
we are releasing a limited edition art book

624
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,220
inspired by "Guitarist, Female Killer."

625
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,290
This limited edition is the work

626
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,360
of visual artist, Jeong Yu-jin.

627
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,390
It's a collaboration work.

628
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:55,360
Season 2 will be coming soon.

629
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:00,230
It's over. Good job.

630
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,990
I almost forgot. I bought presents.

631
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,090
What is it?

632
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,320
Take a look.

633
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,260
Tada.

634
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,120
They're so cute, aren't they?

635
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,560
They're adorable.

636
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,990
Joo-yeon will look so cute in these.

637
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,520
Joo-in, sorry for coming late.

638
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,750
Oh, is that present for us?

639
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,260
No, it's for the baby.

640
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,090
I'm worried that Joo-in might

641
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,890
take over caring for your baby.
She's obsessed.

642
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,250
Of course I will.

643
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,490
During your prenatal care,
you looked at my picture.

644
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,690
So I'm invested in your baby's care.

645
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:41,830
Right. I also named our baby Joo-yeon,

646
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,620
which sounds similar to your name.

647
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,090
Joo-yeon, say "auntie."

648
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,490
Auntie.

649
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:55,620
Hello, Chang-gyu.

650
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,420
Long time no see, Joo-in.

651
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,860
I see that my mom already came.

652
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,050
Tell her to keep coming.
I could use the company.

653
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,220
But why hasn't Bi-soo showed up yet?

654
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,950
It's been a year.

655
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,520
Does he keep in touch with you?

656
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,890
He'll call me from time to time.

657
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,050
Why is he traveling when
he's your boyfriend?

658
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,660
You should see someone else.

659
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,720
Maybe I will.

660
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,990
Mom.

661
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,630
Who is this young lady?

662
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:41,150
I'm a regular customer.
I've met you a few times before.

663
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,860
You resemble my mom
who is living abroad.

664
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,290
That's why I called you, "Mom."

665
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,890
I see.

666
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,750
- I'll go inside to listen to music.
- Sure.

667
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,350
It's a nice day.

668
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,930
Yeah.

669
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,660
Bi-soo, I used my acting skills for my mom.

670
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,960
Today, I played a regular customer.

671
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,650
You did well.

672
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,160
Good job, Joo-in.

673
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,790
I miss you so much today.

674
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,660
Hello Joo-in.

675
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,420
Good morning.

676
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,320
You have mail.

677
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,890
- Here you are. You look prettier in person.
- Thank you.

678
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,820
- I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

679
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,590
(Sender: Han Bi-soo)

680
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,820
(To Joo-in. One year later)

681
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,730
With our backs facing each other,

682
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,550
I'm writing this letter to you.

683
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,590
A year later,

684
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,590
it would be nice

685
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,620
if I could read your letter, too.

686
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,530
But I won't be alive a year from now.

687
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,430
The best thing I did in my life

688
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,450
was falling in love with you.

689
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,320
When I die, I want to die while loving you.

690
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,050
Will you let me?

691
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,990
By the time you read this letter,

692
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,990
you'll probably be enjoying
more fame than before.

693
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,190
To the judges and fans...

694
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,520
Because every part of you is beautiful.

695
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:00,380
I appreciate how you called me
a good person.

696
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,560
And you bravely told me

697
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,160
you'd stick with me.

698
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,620
Most of all,

699
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,530
you're too beautiful

700
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,660
to just

701
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,390
be mine.

702
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,450
After you went away, I grieved.

703
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:05,020
I kept thinking about the spring day
when we were together.

704
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,620
A new spring came but

705
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,220
it doesn't feel special like then.

706
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,190
No matter how much I love you,

707
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,020
I haven't seen what true love is yet.

708
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:26,290
But I'll keep loving you
until I see that love.

709
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,990
Like the way spring comes
after a long winter,

710
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,260
you're always there at the end.

711
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,730
With memories of the spring day
you gifted to me...

712
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,290
I'm going to welcome the next spring
that's coming.

713
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,990
Like how everyone

714
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,990
discovers one another through love,

715
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,960
I'm going to keep loving you.

716
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,720
Sometimes there's pain from
not being with the one you love.

717
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,890
Are you okay?

718
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,590
In the next chapter in my life,

719
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:10,290
I'll cherish the good and bad memories.

720
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,420
I'm able

721
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,260
to chart my own life

722
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,990
thanks to the love you gave me.

723
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,320
I love you.

724
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,920
(Oh! Master)

725
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,750
(Oh! Master)
