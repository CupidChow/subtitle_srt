What's wrong? Did something happen?

7
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,770
Bi-soo, there's something bad
happening to you, right?

8
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,290
No. What kind?

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,890
There is.

10
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,360
You're not telling me.

11

There's nothing going on.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,880
You told me that you had
a secret you couldn't tell me.

13
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,850
Is that it?

14
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,820
Are you

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,810
thinking about leaving me?

16
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,360
What?

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080
You asked Gwang-ja

18
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,300
to be by my side for a long time.

19
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,950
That you would feel relieved
if she were to do that.

20
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,940
Explain what's going on.

21
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,980
Since you are

22
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,530
very close to Gwang-ja,

23
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,840
I asked her to keep you company.

24
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,920
Because I have to move out
after I finish the show scripts.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,270
We can still see each other after that.

26
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,950
Why are you saying such things

27
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,920
as if we're never going to see
each other again?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
That's not my intention.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,620
I want to be with you,

30
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,100
but I have to move out, after all.

31
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,160
If you're going to keep saying that,

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,690
then let's live together
until death do us part.

34

We can get married.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,829
Did you

36
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,060
just propose marriage to me?

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,210
No, I didn't.

sweep the floors. Let me.

You've been working
on the scripts so hard.

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,890

in the office for days. That's unpleasant.

-It's okay. I'll do it.

Her hand?

66

I held her hand many times.

67
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,420
And also did "la bise" with her in France.

69
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,930
She tried it on me once.

I thought that's how you were
supposed to do a la bise.

I'd like another la bise someday.

72

If that's your thing,
give me a la bise when I leave.

you want to visit, just tell me.

Okay. I'll tell you.

Back when Joo-in liked

83
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,120
drinking iced Americano more
than a glass of vin chaud.

84

where you worked.

I was scouted there by a talent agent.

I would wait for you to get off work.

a lot of expired food for free.

How is that nice?

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,660
But my relationship with Joo-in
has no expiration date.

Yu-jin hasn't changed one bit.

97

You were popular among the girls.

98

I was popular too.

99

Why can't you make the guy
not be jealous? That's cooler.

I still have more to give, but I can't.

Then...

328
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,860
How about I imitate you?

329
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,480
How can you be me?

330
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,080
For one day, I'll be like you.

331
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,390
And you'll act like me. What do you think?

332
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,940
You're going to regret it, Joo-in.

333
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,220
We're changing places? Starting now?

334
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,460
All right.

335
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,980
Wake up, Bi-soo.

336
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,280
I don't want to.

337
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,160
Please get up.

338
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,490
You're up.

339
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,680
Are you writing a diary like me?

340
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,700
I'm just writing a list.

341
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,560
A list of things I want to do and eat.

342
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,530
Let's go.

343
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,400
Let's go to the places you want to go
and eat the things you like.

344
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,400
When?

345
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,340
-Right now.
-What's gotten into you?

346
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,390
You have to live life.

347
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,010
Sometimes, you don't act
half as brave as I do.

348
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,020
Jung-hwa, now you're the boss.

349
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,500
Would it be okay to go by ourselves?

350
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,190
What could get any worse than this?

351
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,470
Joo-in, do it gently.
You're scrubbing the skin off me.

352
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,380
Bi-soo, how could I do it
more gently than that?

353
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,530
I'm giving it my best effort.

354
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,670
Oh, my. Was that you?

355
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,840
Bi-soo, you must be starving.

356
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,240
Cook some spicy noodles for me.

357
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,010
I don't recall you
liking noodles though, Bi-soo.

358
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,370
What good is it if I'm a picky eater?

359
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,600
If it tastes good,
then the calories don't matter.

360
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,580
All right then.

361
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,080
It's nice to talk bluntly like Bi-soo.

[President Yoo Dae-young]

363
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,600
I have to snap out of it.

364
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,670
Ms. Kim isn't attracted to you.

365

[President Yoo Dae-young]

367
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
I snapped out of it,
but why am I seeing things?

368
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,060
You didn't say that you were coming.

369
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,240
I just came by to drop off your jacket.

370
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,250
You didn't have to go to the cleaners.
You're a busy person.

371
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,310
I washed and ironed it myself.

372
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,690
You did it yourself?

373
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,360
The stain would've been hard
to remove if I didn't do it quick.

374
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,070
There's nothing you can't do.
You're amazing.

375
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,420
I didn't do much. That's too flattering.

376
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,230
Oh, it is. I'll wear this jacket

377
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,670
every day since you personally ironed it.

378
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,770
Don't overreact. I feel a bit awkward.

379
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,440
Since you ironed it for me,

380
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,210
let me buy you
some freshly squeezed juice.

381
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm afraid of spilling it again.

382
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,790
I would like to use that
as an excuse to see you.

383
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,940
Are you like Heungbu?

384
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,540
-What?
-He asked Nolbu's wife to strike him again

385
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,610
with a rice ladle after she hit him
on the cheek.

386
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,390
I admit I'm more like Heungbu.

387
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,550
Let me treat you to lunch
since I inconvenienced you.

388
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,250
Sure. I'd like that.

389
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,570
Here you go.

390
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,190
Joo-in, you're a good cook.

391
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,950
Eat a lot, Bi-soo.

392
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,510
Let me put it in a bowl.

393
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,710
I can use the lid instead.

394
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,560
So this is how it feels?

395
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,080
Just watching someone eat makes me full.

396
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,300
Then I can eat all of this?

397
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,240
Well, you're savoring it so much

398
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,710
that I must try it.

399
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,000
-What on earth?
-Noodles taste better when you steal some.

400
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,070
Joo-in, you're sneaky. Making moves.

401
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,720
Just go with it.

402
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,620
-Bi-soo, another bite?
-Sure.

403
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,950
How did you know about this place?

404
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,230
It was on your list.
You wrote down, "potato buns".

405
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,580
Oh, gosh. You read my list?

406
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,970
This is delicious.

407
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,830
I don't know why I worked so hard

408
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,140
without taking the time to go on trips.

409
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,410
Well, you can travel all you want now.

410
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,230
Sure. Let's take a picture. As a memento.

411
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,200
-Hold on.
-Okay.

412
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,850
1, 2, 3.

413
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,170
Here.

414
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,230
You can brew coffee very well, Joo-in.

415
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,350
Bi-soo, I have more talents than that.

416
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:45,890
I do kickboxing, I can dance,
and talk in my sleep.

417
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,130
I'm getting sleepy now.

418
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,240
Bi-soo, would you like me
to sing you a lullaby?

419
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,850
Joo-in, you're planning
another sneaky move, right?

420
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,050
Can you just say yes and go along with it?

421
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,320
You're such a party pooper.

422
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,040
I think our moms went on a trip.

423
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,100
Where are they? It looks pretty.

424
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,100
It does? As pretty as Joo-in?

425
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,090
Well, Joo-in

426

is the queen of romantic comedies.

427
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,870
So isn't it obvious?

428
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,040
Yes.

429
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,990
Bi-soo, how about we take
a trip here next time?

430
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,510
After we took a trip together once,
you're liking trips a lot.

431
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,640
Yes.

432
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,890
How about we take
an overnight trip this time?

433
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,830
That's all you think about.

434
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,820
What is it?

435
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,520
Relax and smile.

436
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,170
They look so cute together.

437
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,660
Joo-in looks prettier
since she's being loved.

438
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,230
Bi-soo looks happier too.

439
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,550
My daughter is a woman now.
She knows what love is.

440
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,750
My son is a fine, young man too.

441
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,990
How was today? How was changing places?

442
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,270
It was fun.

and considerate to me.

I found out that you can act really cute.

447
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,760
I was actually very upset.

448
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,400
What? Over what?

449
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,000
I know it was a work event,

450
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,350
but how could you hold his hand?
And pictures were taken.

451
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,490
You said you weren't mad at me.

452
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm a very possessive person. I really am.

453
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,830
But I didn't think it was right
to be like that toward you.

454
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,850
So I suppressed myself.

455
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,340
What if I welcome that?

456
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,760
I was afraid.

457
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,150
What if I couldn't follow through
with actions after acting possessively?

458
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,760
But I'm only going to love you
from now on.

Gosh, you. Show it to me.

463
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,170
I wished that I could be

464

I wished to see a grandkid.

-What? A grandkid?
-Yes.

468
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,230

469

that Bi-soo would find a nice girlfriend.

470
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,780
But now,

471
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,530
I'd like it if Bi-soo and Joo-in
get married.

And have a baby that looks just like them.

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,080
Her vitals have returned to normal.
She'll wake up later today.

Bi-soo,

496
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,270

Bi-soo.

523
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,240
I want you

524

I go on dates with my girlfriend.

539

We got back together.

540
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,420
Wow. You've got skills.
What's your secret?

541
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,010
I didn't do much except

542
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,950
call her every now and then
to ask how she's doing.

543
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,340
She later told me

544
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,020
that our breakup was tough on her.

545
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,080
And she didn't have anyone to lean on

546
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,590
for support except me.

547
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,090
It's my fault.

Hae-jin collapsed while we were there.

It's not your fault, Mom.

In life, things happen
that you have no control over.

-What?
-You said those words to me.

554
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,470

-Really?
-Yes.

556

So don't be so down. You're worrying me.

557
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,150

[Of course, I'm okay.]

How is it there without a roommate?

562
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,200
It's more comfortable
having the room to yourself, isn't it?

563
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,300
Sure.

564
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,950
It's so comfortable
that I can't contain myself.

565
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,330
You need to get scolded
when you come back here.

566
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,340
Because I'm so lonely here.

What's wrong, Jae-hwan?

570
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,470
I've been emailing my script ideas
to Mr. Han,

571
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,060
but he doesn't even look at them.

572
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,250
How could he ignore my work?

573
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,470
He must be very busy.

574
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,860
I don't think
he's interested in what I write.

575
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,720
Why did he give me false hope?

576
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,320
It's not that.

577
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,840
Mr. Han's mom is in critical condition.

578
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,050
Really?

579
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,330
Let's pay a hospital visit then.

580
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,230
He wouldn't like people to know
about his mom's illness.

581
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,740
So just pretend that you don't know.

582
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,480
Why didn't I know that?

583
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,490
Then

584
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,060
the next time I see Mr. Han,

585
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,240
I'll try to make jokes.

586
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,090
What about this?

587
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,210
Mr. Han, I rewrote the scene as you asked.

588
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,850
That's so sexy.

589
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,930
Mr. Han, I rewrote the scene
as you requested.

590
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,940
That's sexy too.

591
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,700
How does this look sexy?

592
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,640
I find nice guys so sexy.

593
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:06,650
What?

594
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,470
Oh, you're so nice. So sexy.

595
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,490
-Don't do that.
-You're sexy.

596
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,360
I didn't ask to be hugged.

597
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,040
I can't hug you when I want to
when I'm your master?

598
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,360
I forgot that you're the master.

599
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,310
How is your mother?

600
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,110
She's all right.

601
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,750
How are you?

602
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,270
There's nothing to worry about in my life.

603
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,880
But you look gaunt.

604
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:18,930
I do?

605
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,010
My mom said I looked fine.

606
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,930
Yes, you are a fine young man
like your mom said.

607
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,930
Go get some rest.

608
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,170
I'll do that.

609
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,380
I wonder if he had supper.

610
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,710
What?

611
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,950
Where did Bi-soo go?

612
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,710
I saw him sitting right here.

613
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,860
Joo-in...

614
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,430
Did he go to the bathroom?

615
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,470
Yes, Gwang-ja.

616
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,160
Bi-soo's mother is all right now.

617
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,600
[That's good to hear.
How is Mr. Han dealing with it?]

618
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,250
It's even hard for me to deal with this.
It's worse for Bi-soo.

619
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,430
When you told me about Bi-soo's favor,

620
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,040
I thought he was going to leave me.

621
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,430
My mind went totally blank.

622
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,880
Gwang-ja, what will I do?

623
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,370
What if I were to lose him?

624
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,840
I don't think I can live without Bi-soo.

625
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,070
Good night, Gwang-ja.

626
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,950
Bi-soo.

627
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,480
Can you see me?

628
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,340
You said you only had eyes for me.

629
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,150
And it's the same for me.

630
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,300
That's good.

631
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,090
You're not talking in your sleep, are you?

632
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,460
But did you go out?

633
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,860
I traveled into your heart.

634
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,880
No, don't get up. Get some sleep.
You look tired.

635
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,290
What about you?

636
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,310
I'll rest too.

637
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,110
Sleep tight.

638
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,970
Don't go anywhere.

639
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,660
I can't ask for too much.

640
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,240
What changed your mind?
You refused to receive chemotherapy.

641
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,800
Bi-soo wants me to do it.

642
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,490
You don't listen to a doctor,
but you listen to your son.

643
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,960
I don't want to break my son's heart

644
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,040
by not trying to beat cancer.

645
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,530
It's for Bi-soo's sake.

646
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,660
Here. Eat something sweet
to boost your mood.

647
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,610
Last night, you were crying
and telling me you can't live without him.

648
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,470
Being with Bi-soo is wonderful.
I love him so much.

649
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,480
What do you love about him?

650
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,330
He was mean to you before.

651
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,300
When I'm around Bi-soo,

652
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,280
I don't think about pursuing happiness.

653
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,590
You said you like acting
because it makes you happy.

654
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,640
Yes.

655
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,120
Crying, pouting, and yelling...

656
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,640
Even when he's not around,

657
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,540
everything that has something to do
with Bi-soo feels special to me.

658
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,590
Mom, make three promises with me.

659
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,650
Three? That many?

660
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,330
Yes.

661
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,440
Promise me.

662
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,840
First,

663
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,760
don't move your hand
when you get injections.

664
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,700
If you make any sudden movements,
your skin...

665
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,480
My skin could start dying?

666
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,520
Second,

667
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,680
drink 1.5 liters of water
after the treatment.

668
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,300
I was a doctor.
You think I don't know that?

669
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,280
Don't worry.

670
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,510
It's my duty to worry about you.
Don't stop me from doing it.

671
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,310
After the treatment,

672
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,660
your hair will fall out.

673
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,740
It will grow back quickly.

674
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,850
What's the third one?

675
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,580
Don't hold back

676
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,600
when you want to cry.

677
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,900
Bi-soo...

678
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,580
Even if I

679
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,910
don't wake up one day...

680
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,330
Don't say that.

681
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,080
You have to receive
the treatment well and...

682
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,250
And?

683
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,030
Try not to die?

684
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,240
Just stay

685
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,180
alive a month longer.

686
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,750
I don't have control over that.

687
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,470
Stay alive. No matter what.

688
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,900
Do it for me.

689
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,470
Okay.

690
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:23,020
[Absolute Bed Rest]

691
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,710
I'll do whatever I can

692
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,080
for you, Son.

693
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:34,900
Thanks to you,

694
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,220
your mom agreed to receive chemotherapy.

695
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,410
I'll try my best.

696
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,110
Are you okay?

697
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,950
Can I ask you a personal question?

698
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,330
Go ahead.

699
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,770
After your husband died in an accident,

700
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,490
how did you cope?

701
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,700
We were inseparable.

702
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,510
We were always together, so when he died,

703
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,960
life didn't have any meaning.

704
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,520
I cried for many days.
I'd cry myself to sleep.

705
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,700
I prayed to the Almighty to take me too.

706
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,320
Did things get better over time?

707
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,880
I don't know. Am I feeling better?

708
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,950
From time to time, I'd suddenly cry

709
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,560
when getting up in the morning.

710
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,330
I'm starting to miss him again.

711
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,900
You never thought about

712
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,940
seeing someone else to get over your loss?

713
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,910
I did.

714
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,680
But even while contemplating it,

715
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,660
I knew no one could replace him.

716
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,060
Nobody can fill that emptiness I have.

717
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,540
But your late husband

718
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,270
would probably wish you
to have a happy life.

719
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,210
I think he was my soulmate,
and no one else can compare.

720
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,410
That makes me feel better.

721
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,980
[Master]

722
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,980
[Where are you?
I'm in front of the house.]

723
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,470
[49 days from now]

724
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,950
[you'll vanish completely
from this world.]

725
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,590
He's not home yet?

726
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,750
What?

727
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,050
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

728
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,360
How is your mother?

729
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,830
Don't mind her.

730
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,630
What do you mean?

731
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,960
She has nothing to do with you,
so you don't have to ask.

732
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,350
Why are you being like that again?

733
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,750
I won't be turning the lights on anymore.

734
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,890
Why are you acting like this again?

735
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,050
I want to end this.

736
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,310
What did you...

737
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,550
What did you just say?

738
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,280
I'll repeat it.

739
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,390
Let's end this.

740
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,470
Do you mean it?

741
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,570
Yes.

742
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,370
You don't mean it. I can tell.

743
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,180
Stop acting like you know me.

744
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,770
This is how I really feel.

745
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,540
I can't accept it. This is too sudden.

746
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,560
I'll forget that you even said this.

747
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:18,880
Listen.

748
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:21,690
Listen!

749
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,780
Why?

750
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,600
You never listen to me.

751
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,490
Why do I have to listen?

752
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,300
You remember the wish I had?

753
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,290
It's my wish.

754
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,150
Let's stop seeing each other.

755
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:01,090
[Oh! Master]
