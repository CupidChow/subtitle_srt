The secret he's talking about...

Does that mean he's not my dad?

He's not my real dad, right?

What made you turn away from me?

25

I wasn't able to be a great dad to you
since I'm not your biological dad.

Yet, I've always considered you
as my own son.

Things turned out better this way, right?

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,790
You hated my guts.
Now that you know the truth,

35
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,550
it must feel great, doesn't it?

36
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,079
That look on your face.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,810
The look of utter disgust
as if I'm a dirtbag.

38
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,740
You gave me that look for 18 years.

39

I despised you for it.

40

I thought you would tell your mom
about my affair.

41

It's hard to believe

-You're tough.
-You told me not to tell her.

What do you mean?

114
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,380
If your dad had not died, your mom
wouldn't have suffered a stroke.

115
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,600
And you wouldn't have lost your house.

And you wouldn't have experienced
hardships at a young age.

So why don't you resent your dad?

118

You only recall the fond memories
you had with him.

119

I faced hardships,
but I didn't resent him over that.

Be honest with yourself.

121

If you were to resent your dad,
it would crush your soul.

122

So you lie to yourself
that everything was okay.

Aren't you pretending this whole time?

It's the same way you cope
with your mother's Alzheimer's.

You tell yourself that her memories
will wane much later.

A little.

144

Seems like he likes you a lot.

Why do you think he does?

146
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,710
He treats people like they're invisible
if he's not interested in them.

147
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,530
Since he's depressed,
he wants your attention.

148
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,920
But he scratches you
like a cat, doesn't he?

149
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,280
He won't tell me what's bothering him.
If I knew what it was, I could help.

150
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,570
Once he gets exhausted,
he'll open up to you.

151
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,790
He'll explain his behavior.

treat him as a "cat" owner?

163
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,670
I think I need to brace myself
for what you'll say.

164
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,330
You're divorcing Dad anyway.

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,280
And I think you need to know
about that man's other side.

166
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,620
That man?

167
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,490
-Are you talking about your dad?
-Yes.

168
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,920
A long time ago,

169
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,540
I saw him sleeping with another woman.

170
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,900
They were in our house together.

171
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,570
Are you all right?

172
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,810
Does your dad know that you saw him?

173
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,370
Was it

174
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,080
around the time you were 18?

175
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,430
I'm sorry, Bi-soo.

176
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,870
Why are you sorry?

177
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,200
I didn't know anything
about this when I'm your mom.

178
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,840
I kept it to myself.
There was no way you could know.

179
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,540
I understand now.

180
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,820
Why you moved out
and started living alone.

181
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,140
Why you stayed away from him.

182
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,150
You didn't show it even though
it was eating at you.

183
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,550
It's an ad campaign that we came up with.

184
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,280
A premium line product ad?

185
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,680
We were planning to
only have you appear in the ad.

186
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,700
But the marketing team
believes that if I were

187
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,990
to appear together with you as a couple,
it would build trust in our brand.

188
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,300
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to go with this ad campaign.

189
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,450
Yu-jin, I'm your company's spokesmodel.

190
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,890
It's my duty to fulfill
my obligations as well as possible.

191
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,340
But if I were to appear in an ad campaign
showing us as a couple,

192
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,930
that would be careless toward you
and Writer Han.

193
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,140
Do you think

194
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,470
Bi-soo can truly make you happy?

195
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,660
[Director Han Min-joon]

196
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,480
You disgust me.

197
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,160
What?

198
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,609
Not only was he shocked
with witnessing you cheat on me,

199
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,990
but you also threatened him.

200
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,100
Did Bi-soo say that?

201
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,210
I wanted to provide Bi-soo with
a stable family because he had no dad.

202
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,910
How could you inflict
such emotional pain on him?

203
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,050
I see now why he hated
coming to our house.

204
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,550
Unable to tell me,
he dealt with the secret all by himself.

205
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,770
Keep your promise that this won't
change the terms of our divorce.

206
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,830
How can you say that right now?

207
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,810
-Give me ownership of this hospital.
-What?

208
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,300
You wanted me to be like
a father to Bi-soo.

209
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,240
And I wanted to own Sein Hospital
in exchange for that.

210
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,550
That was the premise of our marriage.

211
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,060
I married you
without knowing your intentions.

212
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,210
You and Bi-soo have made me
look like the worst person on earth.

213
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,310
There has to be something in this for me.

214
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm the director of Sein Hospital.

215
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,180
I didn't work this hard
to just be the hospital director!

216
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,150
I did everything you asked of me.

217
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,730
You should have done it properly then.

218
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,130
I signed the divorce papers
since it was your last request.

219
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,530
Am I a bad person for asking
for this hospital?

220
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,850
Once you die, you can't
take this hospital with you.

221
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,670
Bi-soo isn't interested

222
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,140
-in managing this hospital.
-Don't you

223
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,490
dare say my son's name!

224
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,940
Even though you despise me
for my behavior,

225
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,980
I'm the right person
to lead this hospital.

226
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,180
I'm going to hold a board meeting
to have you fired.

227
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,870
You viewed other patient records,
which is illegal.

228
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,050
And you received kickbacks from suppliers.

229
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,960
You did too much shady stuff
to have this hospital.

230
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,270
I'm not giving up.

231
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,980
By the way, take your
belongings out of the house.

232
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,380
I put the house on sale.

233
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,050
It's me, Bi-soo.

234
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,330
You won't even talk to me now.

235
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,440
I thought you'd keep the secret,

236
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,420
[but you told your mom.]

237
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,850
[I'm going to fight back.]

238
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,380
Say something, Bi-soo.

239
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,220
[I said, say something!]

240
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,360
[It's hard to believe
you kept it to yourself for 18 years.]

241
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,460
[You're tough.]

242
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,190
[You hated my guts.
Now that you know the truth,]

243
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,820
[it must feel great, doesn't it?]

244
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,810
[Mom]

245
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,750
[Sein Hospital]

246
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,750
[Your loss of speech is caused]

247
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,600
by a traumatic shock. It's temporary.

248
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,290
The neurologist says
your tests came back normal.

249
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,980
So your aptitude in grammar
and language is fine.

250
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,800
You don't have any language disabilities.

251
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,700
They prescribed you medication,
so take it.

252
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,100
You need rest. That will help.

253
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,900
[Don't tell my mom.]

254
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,340
When I lost my husband,
I didn't speak for a while.

255
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,260
He died in an accident
where I was driving.

256
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,540
Peopled asked,
"What happened to your husband?"

257
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,760
Are you all right?

258
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,830
I couldn't say anything to that.

259
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,660
For a while, I didn't talk at all.

260
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,970
It was painful to answer
people's questions.

261
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,030
I shut my mouth to avoid being hurt.

262
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,440
What do you think is your reason?

263
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,450
Do you think
Bi-soo can truly make you happy?

264
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,240
Writer Han.

265
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,980
Now tell me.

266
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,030
I need to know
what's going in your life lately.

267
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,520
Say something.

268
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,420
If you don't want to talk,
then write down your feelings.

269
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,190
See the notepad on the fridge?

270
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,340
[It was painful to answer
people's questions.]

271
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,250
[I shut my mouth to avoid being hurt.]

272
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,730
[What do you think is your reason?]

273
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,900
Bi-soo, is everything okay?

274
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,830
You're not answering your phone.

275
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,450
I'm fine. Let's talk later.

276
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,600
[Writer Han, I'm coming in.]

277
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,960
What do you want for breakfast?

278
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,780
How about French toast with warm milk?

279
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,590
Or spicy stew with tuna?

280
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,560
Or...

281
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,250
Writer Han.

282
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,760
Why can't you speak?

283
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,610
What's wrong? You're sick, aren't you?

284
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,330
I'll take you to a doctor.

285
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,210
This is delicious.
The broth is so flavorful.

286
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,980
It should be.

287
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,500
I waited in line to buy it.

288
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,740
You're not glad to see me.
Is it because we saw each other yesterday?

289
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,750
You haven't said a word since I got here.

290
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,790
People get speechless
when they're so happy.

291
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,470
Is that so, Bi-soo?

292
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,100
You need to eat a hot meal to feel better.

293
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,290
Go ahead.

294
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,330
How do you like it?

295
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,390
Seems like it tastes all right.

296
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,320
Writer Han doesn't talk when he eats.

297
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,810
He has a single-minded focus. Right?

298
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,250
-He's irritating, isn't he?
-What?

299
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,650
He crosses people with his blunt talk.

300
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,920
But he's not frank about his feelings.

301
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,040
I've raised him for 36 years, and
I realized he needs a lot of attention.

302
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,660
But he grew into a fine, young man.

303
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,430
I agree.

304
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,510
Even if he gets irritating,
try to be patient with him.

305
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,370
I'm being patient with him already.
I have to do more?

306
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,310
He's abrasive around people
who are close to him.

307
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,540
Yet, he's also the giving type.
And he'll be faithful to you.

308
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,930
You'll do that, won't you?

309
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,910
Oh, look at me.
I'm interrupting you from eating.

310
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,900
Since you're not saying a word,

311
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,910
I have to keep chatting with her.

312
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,670
Keep eating.

313
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,610
I can't even give you a hug now?

314
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,810
I know that you can't speak.

315
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,200
It's not because you don't want to.

316
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,270
Dr. Jung told me.

317
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:39,200
I want to know everything
that goes on in your life now.

318
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,320
You were like this when you were 18.

319
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,940
Bi-soo, you don't have to
keep everything inside.

320
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,140
You're going through a lot of pain.

321
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,470
Your brain is telling you

322
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,530
not to say anything.

323
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,520
You'll get better soon, right?

324
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,290
[I don't understand Writer Han sometimes.]

325
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,570
Is living together with someone this hard?

326
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,170
I kind of don't like him now.

327
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,980
Why is he giving you a hard time?

328
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,540
You don't have to dislike him.

329
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,650
Do you want me to tell him to move out?

330
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,870
[No.]

331
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,600
[What a reaction.]

332
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,580
[Although he's irritating, you still
want him around, don't you?]

333
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,650
What am I going to do with you?
You're in love.

334
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,140
I have to hang up. I'll call you later.

335
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,590
[Bye, Joo-in!]

336
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,080
I'll get going, Joo-in.

337
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,070
Let's have lunch sometime.
Just the two of us.

338
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,490
I'd like that.

339
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,010
Let's leave him out since he's too blunt.

340
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,250
Bye.

341
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,790
You were angry for days.

342
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,980
But after seeing your mom,
you're all smiles.

343
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,260
It's frustrating
to be not able to speak, right?

344
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,940
You see, I have a special ability.

345
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,150
I know what you're saying
even when you don't make a sound.

346
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,660
Try to say something.

347
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,650
It's true. You don't believe me?

348
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,050
Hold on.

349
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,470
I need to be closer to see your mouth.

350
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,520
Go ahead.

351
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,380
You said, "Joo-in". That's too easy.

352
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,690
I like you.

354
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,380
I already know that you like me.

355
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,400
I've been this patient with you.
Of course you have to like me.

356
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,300
Anything else you'd like to say?

357
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,930
I love you.

358
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,610
You're so bad. You ruined the mood.

359
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,850
Who would go out with you?

360
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,700
I'll have to keep you around
for the rest of my life.

361
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,710
Can I ask you what your blood type is?

362
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,070
-I'm Type B.
-Oh, my. I'm also Type B.

363
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,100
What? She said
she wasn't going to stay long.

364
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,520
When I saw your photo,
you looked very pretty, Suzie.

365
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,330
But seeing you in person,
you're even prettier.

366
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,670
Oh, my.

367
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,290
I'm so flattered.

368
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,810
-But it's true.
-You're making me blush.

369
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,210
You're very funny.

370
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,550
Jae-hwan.

371
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,700
Suzie, who is this person?

372
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,090
Suzie?

373
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,690
Her name is Bae Gwang-ja.

374
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,170
-Aren't you Bae Suzie?
-I go by the name, Suzie,

375
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,110
in English conversation class.

376
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,080
I'm sorry.

377
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,790
Excuse me for interrupting.
But she's the woman I love.

378
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,650
And her name is Bae Gwang-ja.

379
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,930
My Jae-hwan!

380
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,280
My Jae-hwan.

381
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,300
What is it, Bae Suzie?

382
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,880
I admit that I was a bit attracted to him.

383
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,000
But the more I talked with him,
the more I thought about you.

384
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,150
I couldn't get up
in the middle of our conversation.

385
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,260
I don't believe you anymore.

386
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,660
My Jae-hwan.

387
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,510
Come back.

388
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,430
[President Kim Yi-na]

389
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,680
I was reading some articles
about you just now.

390
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,280
What's wrong?

391
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,970
Ms. Kim, I'm not dating Yu-jin.

392
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,190
What?

393
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,290
I'm seeing Writer Han.

394
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,270
Then what is going on with you
and Director Jeong?

395
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,830
He's just a friend.

396
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,929
But I'm really dating Writer Han.

397
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,480
Yu-jin knows about it too.

398
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,280
And

399
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,060
I'm living with Writer Han
in the same house.

400
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,690
What?

401
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,150
You're living with Mr. Han?

402
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,889
So that's why he was in your house.

403
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,179
This is a very important development.

404
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,190
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

405
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,929
You just announce the news,
and I get to say nothing about it?

406
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,070
I'm sorry that I'm telling you so late.

407
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,550
But I didn't mean any disrespect.

408
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,489
I'll keep this short.
Get Mr. Han to move out of your home.

409
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,179
I won't see you until that happens.

410
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,820
I told Ms. Kim that we're dating.

411
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,250
You're grateful, aren't you?

412
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,120
I chose you despite the fact
that you didn't show up that day.

413
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,690
Now you're not going anywhere.

414
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,990
I told you before.

415
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,260
Once I like someone, I like them forever.

416
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,710
[Telling Ms. Kim about us
won't help your career.]

417
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,970
[Why did you do it?]

418
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,050
Because I love you.

419
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,170
Joo-in.

420
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,120
Writer Han!

421
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,590
Joo-in.

422
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,850
I really like you, Joo-in.

423
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,180
I didn't know it could feel
this good to hear my name.

424
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,700
I was scared

425
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,810
that I wouldn't be able to speak again.

426
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,350
There's a lot I have to tell you.

427
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,780
Now you can't do anything
without me, can you?

428
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,870
I need to go somewhere.

429
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,130
Where would you go
right after regaining your words?

430
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,410
I've been hurting inside.

431
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,970
So I need to release the pain.

432
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,980
[Go ahead and tell your mom what you saw.]

433
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,660
But that will make your mom cry.

434
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,020
She'll be sad thinking about that
for the remainder of her life.

435
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,590
You're a smart boy, Bi-soo.

436
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,220
Do you understand what I'm saying?

437
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,150
It's all right now.

438
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,490
It's all right.

439
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,530
The scripts are taking a while,
aren't they?

440
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes.

441
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,530
When Bi-soo works on a script,
he doesn't even take my calls.

442
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,400
-But he does a great...
-Mr. Yoo.

443
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,580
-Yes?
-This won't do.

444
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,140
Call a driver for me later.

445
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,590
I think we're going to be
drinking a lot tonight.

446
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:15,060
Joo-in and Mr. Han like each other.

447
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,080
What?

448
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,600
-They're living together.
-Bi-soo is living with Ms. Oh?

449
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,100
I think I invested
too much of my time in her.

450
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,170
Actors can always sign with another agency
if they're offered better terms.

451
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,250
I think I need to keep my emotions
to myself to avoid getting hurt.

452
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,660
That doesn't exactly work though.

453
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,110
Even if you'll get hurt eventually,
it's better to follow your heart.

454
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,860
Joo-in was one of the few people
I trusted.

455
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,190
I think I was too involved emotionally.

456
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,980
-Look straight at me.
-What?

457
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,690
You like me, don't you?

458
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,870
You're cute.

459
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,140
She said I'm cute.

460
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,030
What does that mean?

461
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,180
You're not sleeping?

462
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,520
Are you going somewhere?

463
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,770
I just wanted to
see your face one more time.

464
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,160
Don't come too close.
My heart will skip a beat.

465
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,800
What is it?

466
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,070
I need a new lightbulb.

467
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,560
-I'll go buy one.
-You will?

468
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,580
Your room has to be bright.
It helps me write.

469
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,600
So this is related to work.

470
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,830
You should wear a jacket.

471
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,720
My wallet.

472
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,730
It's nice to change it together, right?

473
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,320
Yes.

474
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,220
Anything else?

475
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,460
Sleep here.

476
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,350
What?

477
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,970
I couldn't sleep well because
you were worrying me.

478
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,490
So help me go to sleep.

479
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,520
How am I supposed to do that?

480
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,120
I need to tell you how?

481
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,640
Use your own methods.

482
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,220
Hey, Bi-soo.

483
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,620
I gave you a pass because I'm nice.

484
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,950
You got angry. You wouldn't look at me.

485
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,150
You wouldn't talk to me.
What was I supposed to do?

486
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,360
If you ever do that again,

487
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,060
I'll kick you out of the house.

488
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,160
This is nice.

489
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,640
You could've done it sooner.

490
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,590
Mom.

491
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,270
This fine, young man
who can also speak eloquently

492
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,790
would like to have lunch with you.
How does that sound?

493
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,840
I can't believe you're serving me lunch.

494
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,830
You've cooked for me for 36 years.
It's just one meal.

495
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,140
This is special.

496
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,640
The best TV writer in the country
cooked this meal himself.

497
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,150
-The rice is cooked well.
-Hold on.

498
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,540
Try that.

499
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,810
It's grilled just right.

500
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,610
It's not fishy at all.

501
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,560
It looks nice watching you eat.

502
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,290
You're just like your dad.

503
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,710
Your real dad would say that to me.

504
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,100
My real dad?

505
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,970
You don't want to hear about him?

506
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,500
No, go ahead.

507
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,220
His grandpa and grandma
ran a small corner store.

508
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,160
When we'd visit the store,
he would cook a meal for me.

509
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,470
I thought it would be wonderful
to spend my life with him.

510
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,400
He must've been your ideal type.

511
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,040
Not at all.

512
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,230
He was a very difficult person.

513
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,960
We got into a lot of fights.

514
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,780
You liked him after fighting so much.

515
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,890
After we had an autopsy class,
I could hardly stand up.

516
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,590
So I was leaning on a rail
and dry heaving.

517
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:51,030
He offered me tea in a thermos

518
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,480
What?

519
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,290
That's it?

520
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,020
It was that easy to win your heart?

521
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,050
After drinking the warm barley tea,
I felt so much better.

522
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,030
It was relaxing.

523
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,030
So your dad told me to come to him
when the class was too much to handle.

524
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,970
He said his thermos was only for me

525
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,770
Then what happened?

526
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,130
He got in a car accident and died.

527
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,160
Before you were born.

528
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,270
He would've been a good dad to you.

529
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,920
What was his name?

530
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,700
Lee...

531
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:00,210
Lee Young-gil.

532
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,150
Lee Young-gil.

533
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,150
Why are you giving me that look
after having a nice meal?

534
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,210
What look?

535
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,910
You don't have to look at me
with any pity.

536
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,310
I had you, Mom. That's more than enough.

537
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,090
I should've told you
about your real dad sooner.

538
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:37,710
I wouldn't have gone through that pain

539
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,190
in my teens had I known about him.

540
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,910
You hate me for it, don't you?

541
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,110
Tell me.

542
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:51,700
I'll listen to whatever you have to say
about any unresolved issues.

543
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,110
Except for that, you were a perfect mom.

544
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,850
Bi-soo.

545
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:06,190
I talked to your stepdad
and finalized everything.

546
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,730
Now he won't bother you again.
I settled it all.

547
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,660
That's good to hear.

548
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,180
There's no mom better than me, right?

549
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,440
Of course.

550
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,520
That was a wonderful lunch.

551
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,330
I'll cook for you more.

552
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,830
How much longer do I have to wait?
Talk to me, Jae-hwan.

553
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,930
Are you still mad about
the arranged date I went on?

554
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,580
-No.
-That won't ever happen again.

555
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,680
I won't do anything
to make you angry again.

556
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,570
Is that even possible?

557
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,930
I moved out of my family house.

558
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,830
Really? Your dad
would be angry then, wouldn't he?

559
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,560
No parent can bend their child's will.

560
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,400
I need to come out strong.

561
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,090
You gave me the courage
to stand up to my dad.

562
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,530
Where are you staying?

563
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,080
I'm going to stay at a 24-hour sauna.

564
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,440
I can't let you stay there.

565
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,190
How about you stay at my studio apartment?

566
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,290
I can crash at a friend's place.

567
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,680
No, I don't want to
inconvenience you like that.

568
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,370
Then stay at my company's office.
There are cots.

569
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,840
What if your boss comes?

570
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,690
He doesn't stay there at night.

571
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,850
We can be together in the office.
It'll just be you and me.

572
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,780
I like that.

573
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,940
You're not angry anymore, right?

574
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,870
I wasn't ever angry.

575
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,850
You're my Jae-hwan.

576
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,290
-My Jae-hwan.
-Don't say that.

577
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,120
-Stop it.
-My Jae-hwan.

578
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,550
-You're back.
-Hi.

579
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,980
What?

580
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,080
Very good.

581
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,640
How about writing a dancing scene?

582
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:14,370
The girl doesn't know
why the boy is suffering,

583
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:18,070
so she dances nonchalantly,
pretending not to be curious.

584
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,000
You really don't want to know why?

585
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,900
I'm pretending not to be curious.

586
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:32,300
I have something to tell you, Joo-in.

587
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:49,650
Something good happened to you.

588
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,500
I had the most delicious lunch ever.

589
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,370
I wonder how good it was.
You look so happy.

590
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,670
Chang-gyu.

591
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:06,370
I'd like to hear you play a song
on a wonderful day like this.

592
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,810
All right. Let me repay you with a song.

593
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,720
I love this part.

594
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,590
I looked up to my stepdad.
I wanted to be like him when I grew up.

595
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,580
That's why it was so shocking.

596
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,570
It must have been tough
to keep that all to yourself.

597
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,560
Here. You can lean on my shoulder.

598
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,670
What you said to me wasn't exactly wrong.

599
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,430
What?

600
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:37,920
I did resent my dad
a little after he died.

601
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,010
But I also realized something
at that time.

602
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,980
And what's that?

603
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:50,190
You don't know how much time
you have left in your life.

604
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,570
That's why I didn't want to
dwell on feelings of resentment.

605
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,050
Don't be held down by your past.
Be in the present. With me.

606
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,540
Like now? Happily with you?

607
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,140
Yes.

608
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,630
Appreciate this time now.
Don't save it for later.

609
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,240
Don't worry about things
that haven't happened yet.

610
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,530
It's nice to lean on you.
And listening to your advice.

611
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,450
If you start liking this too much,
that's bad for me.

612
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,730
[Han Bi-soo]

613
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,380
[Han Bi-soo]

614
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,700
[Han Bi-soo]

615
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,860
[I only have eyes...]

616
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:19,520
[I only have eyes for you, Joo-in]

617
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,040
I only have eyes for you, Joo-in.

618
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,020
I only have eyes for you, Joo-in.

619
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,330
Why are you repeating it?

620
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,430
I can almost hear your echo.

621
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,240
Let me say it.

622
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,190
I only have eyes for you, Joo-in.

623
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,710
You're so cute.

624
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,560
That's making me blush, you know.

625
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,840
But you're cuter.

626
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,120
Bi-soo.

627
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,310
How about we have a beer?

628
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,620
Where are you going?

629
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,230
Joo-in, are you joking with me?

630
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,670
Are you asleep?

631
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,240
He was here a minute ago.

632
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,490
Relax.

633
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,810
You're...

634
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,690
What's happening?

635
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,630
How is this possible?
Why can't Joo-in see me?

636
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,790
Did you make me disappear?

637
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,850
I didn't do it.

638
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,630
But yes, you have disappeared.

639
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,270
He even left his phone here.
Where could he have gone?

640
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,330
Why did you show up again?

641
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,270
Did you think about it?

642
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,920
How to spend your remaining life?

643
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,340
I'm really going to die?

644
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:29,840
When?

645
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,150
That doesn't matter.

646
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,590
You're already as good as dead.

647
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,310
What?

648
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,880
There's no point in living
if you're not in love.

649
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,820
That sounds silly.
You said I would die. Explain that.

650
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,410
49 days from now,

651
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,910
you'll vanish completely from this world.

652
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:12,810
[Oh! Master]
