-He made the first move.
-I knew it.

Yu-jin will treat you really well.

-Like how?
-You know what she did, Doctor.

135

She sold the house I was living in
without telling me.

-Sure.

I don't think you came here
to talk about that.

when she's not around.

316

Sometimes she gets in the way,
which bothers me.

it gives me a sense of reassurance.

326
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,910
What's wrong?

327
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,900
This house is really cozy.

328
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,420
That's right.

329
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,250
And do you watch TV together?

330
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,360
With Writer Han? No way.

331
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,440
I hardly watch any TV because
it could distract him while he works.

332
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,880
Maybe I should move in here too.

333
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,430
What?

334
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,070
I noticed you had an empty room.

335
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,510
I get lonely living by myself.

336
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,410
You're not being serious, are you?

337
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,800
Why? Did I make you nervous
by asking that?

338
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,460
How about some coffee?

339
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,560
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

340
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,280
Hi, Writer Han.

341
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,900
Did you have dinner?

342
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,340
I hope you didn't eat
another ready-made meal.

343
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,020
You're here, Mr. Han.

344
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,840
What is he doing here?

345
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,840
That makes me feel like I'm entering
a stranger's house.

346
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,450
Mr. Han, I'm not mistaken, am I?

347
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,340
Seemed like you were dropping
the honorifics.

348
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,930
I always speak in a polite form.

349
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,500
Oh, did I, bud?

350
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm an impatient person, you see.

351
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,400
So I have a habit of dropping honorifics.

352
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,890
But I'll try to fix that, pal.

353
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,730
Thanks.

354
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,110
Would you like some coffee too?

355
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,370
I'll pass on the coffee.

356
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,800
-Do you also cook?
-What?

357
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,110
Well, I saw you working in the kitchen
so naturally

358
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,290
like it was your space.

359
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,430
So I thought you were going
to cook something up.

360
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,960
I didn't know you had
such a sense of humor.

361
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,940
I should come and hang out
here more. It's fun.

362
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,980
Let's all sit down instead of standing.

363

364
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,330
How was your day, Master?

365
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,690
Master?

366
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,460
-Yes, Master.
-Why are you suddenly calling me that?

367
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,890
What do you mean?

368
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,660
You put it in the contract

369
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,880
on how to specifically call you.

370
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,190
Those were the terms you wanted.

371
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,200
I call you Master. I'm Writer Han.

372
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,430
Before, you told me you needed time

373
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,650
to adjust to those terms.

374
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,580
I'd like to make up for the lengthy time

375
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,750
it took to get used to it.

376
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,160
So I'll call you Master from now on.

377
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,930
That's an awkward way to address someone.

378
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,780
It's what she wanted. Don't ask me.

379
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,920
Should I ask her to change it?
Would you like to?

380
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, no. I'll try to get used to it.

381
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,790
Sure, Master.

382
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,130
Okay.

383
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,510
I'll retire to my room then, Master.

384
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,640
Sure.

385
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,240
And enjoy your coffee as a pretend couple.

386
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,520
What is it?

387
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,590
What are you doing, Writer Han?

388
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,690
Can't you tell, Master?

389
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,500
I've never seen you play with that before.

390
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,900
I've never seen a pretend couple
before either.

391
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,800
Yu-jin left.

392
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,270
Then come in.

393
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,620
Why did you send him home so early?

394
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,000
I didn't ask him to go.

395
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,690
He just wanted to
brew a cup of coffee before leaving.

396
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,080
I see.

397
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,980
So you came to tell me he left?

398
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,400
I had a commercial shoot today.

399
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,460
After the shoot, Yu-jin came,
and we had dinner.

400
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,600
Then he gave me a ride home.

401
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,860
Why are you telling me this?

402
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,390
Nothing much happened.
It was just a regular day.

403
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,450
How is that nothing?

404

That's how people start dating.

405

What? You're also good
at shooting baskets?

406
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,470
You can shoot well too.
You just need to learn the right posture.

407

You're confident with your skills,
aren't you? You want to play?

That way, we can do things quicker.

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,930
I don't know what to get her.

489
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,240
How about throwing a party?

490
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,310
-Throw a party?
-Yes, a farewell party here.

491
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,450
Here? Will that be okay?

492
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,630
I'll help out.

493
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,860
You were nice to my mom
when she came over last time.

494
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,210
I'll also bring my mom.

495
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,680
It will be nice if we invite everyone.

496
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,320
As long as you agree.

497
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,800
My mom would love it.

498
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,440
What kind of script is this?

499
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,790
I didn't get a heads-up on this.

500
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,980
Now you're calling the shots?

501
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,530
Well, Chief--

502
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,170
I'm wondering why

503
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,810
the show is going in a totally
different direction.

504
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,640
After reading it, you'll see that
it's much better and improved.

505
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,690
I'm not having it.

506
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,950
The show title is now,
"Guitarist, Female Killer".

507
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,310
The doctor suddenly
became a female killer.

508
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,040
There're a murder plot
and romance altogether.

509
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,870
I apologize for these changes
without telling you.

510
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,080
You're sorry?

511
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,280
I accept your apology.
Let's get this going.

512
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,210
So in six months, we'll have

513
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,740
a hit show on our hands, right?

514
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,310
The network is picking up the show?

515
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,140
Thank you!

516
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,220
I asked Bi-soo to come out
and celebrate together,

517
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,820
but he hates parties.

518
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,220
Well, that can't be helped.
Let's celebrate ourselves.

519
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,050
I'm surprised that you chose this place.

520
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,870
I thought you were more of
a wine-drinking person.

521
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,570
On a day like this,
soju is the perfect drink.

522
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,000
My goodness.

523
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,940
I was so worried that the network
wouldn't pick up our show.

524
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,210
But the chief gave us a big break.
I'm so relieved.

525
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,640
During my 15 years in the business,

526
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,760
I've gone through so many ups and downs.

527
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,650
And the job never gets easier.

528
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,390
For 15 years?
I've also been an agent for 15 years.

529
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,560
-Really?
-I started out as a road manager at 25.

530
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,880
But I quit to start my own agency
with just hopes and dreams.

531
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,490
I also started out as
a TV producer at age 25.

532
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,270
We have a lot in common.

533
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,070
Here.

534
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,640
-I'll pour you one.
-Oh, sure.

535
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,410
Joo-in!

536
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,260
Congratulations on
having your show picked up.

537
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,170
What? You asked me to come
to congratulate me?

538
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,060
How did you find out so fast?

539
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,200
I keep a close tab on
what goes on in your career.

540
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,380
I even made mojito, your favorite.

541
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,740
Yu-jin, you know me too well.

542
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,010
I'm going to have
my mojito drink right now.

543
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,020
Just a minute.

544
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,000
Let's open this bottle of champagne first.

545
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,120
Are you okay?

546
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,170
This brings back memories.

547
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,610
The day we celebrated together
when you got your first lead role.

548
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,890
And you spilled all of the champagne.

549
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,360
It was on purpose. I got so emotional.

550
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,250
Did it mean a lot to you too?

551
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,610
Well, that was two days before
I was leaving for Paris.

552
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,550
I was happy that you won that role,

553
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,190
and at the same time,
I was sad that I was leaving you.

554
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,750
You probably didn't know that
I had such mixed emotions.

555
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,640
Why wouldn't I know?

556
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,880
I acted like I didn't notice
because I didn't want to kill the mood.

557
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,050
Really?

558
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,870
At the airport, you were smiling
as you waved goodbye.

559
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,970
I was crying inside.

560
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,160
I didn't want to dampen your mood
during your Paris flight.

561
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,600
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

562
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,449
Let's eat.

563
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,969
I wish we could spend
the whole night together.

564
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,389
Not like that. I just want to be with you.

565
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,159
We used to hang out all night.

566
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,030
When I got my first supporting role,
I remember how we stayed up all night.

567
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,380
You helped me read my lines.

568
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,780
It doesn't feel right
that you'll be going back home

569
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,170
with Mr. Han there.

570
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,900
Excuse me for a second.

571
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,800
What is it?

572
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,200
Open it.

573
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,170
I didn't get you anything though.

574
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,720
I don't want something back.

575
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,050
Give me your hand.

576
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,110
I knew it would look nice on you.

577
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,320
Thanks.

578
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,850
[I didn't come to your rescue
to receive a thank you.]

579
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,830
It makes me feel awkward.

580
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,470
And I don't want you to feel
grateful toward me either.

581
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,080
So I forbid you from ever thanking me.

582
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,810
Wear it often, okay?

583
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,240
Of course, you won't need to check
the time when you're with me.

584
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,390
And why would I not need to?

585
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,790
Because I won't let you be bored.

586
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,970
It fits perfectly, doesn't it?

587
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,650
It looks great on you.

588
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,470
The Guitarist, Female Killer is here!

589
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,880
What is this? You surprised me.

590
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,770
Did you go somewhere?

591
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,930
I just met Yu-jin.

592
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,710
Were you waiting for me, Writer Han?

593
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,020
No.

594
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,790
I wanted to have some champagne today,

595
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,840
so I had some.

596
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,100
But I see two glasses.

597
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,960
Well, you know I love champagne.

598
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,720
So I pour two drinks for myself

599
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,570
and drink it left and right.

600
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,670
You should've called me
that you were waiting.

601
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,690
The champagne was for me.

602
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,670
That's a new watch.

603
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,230
Oh, Yu-jin gave it to me. It's a gift.

604
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,340
He has a knack for picking nice gifts.

605
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,730
When Yu-jin gave me this watch,

606
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,370
I thought about you.

607
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,550
I wondered what you were doing.

608
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,700
-I see.
-You worked so hard because of me.

609
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,520
I demanded that you do a rewrite.
And you made all the changes I asked for.

610
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm glad you know that.

611
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,510
I delivered, and the network
picked up the show.

612
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,400
When I agreed to join the show,

613
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,830
the network already committed
to picking it up.

614
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,310
So you've got star power, is that it?

615
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,020
I really wanted to drink
all of the champagne by myself.

616
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,930
If it weren't for you,

617
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,330
the network wouldn't have
picked up the show.

618
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,060
Thank you for turning things around
and trusting me.

619
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,410
Thanks.

620
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,020
I forbid you from saying thank you.

621
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,010
I can't be the only one banned
from saying it. It's only fair.

622
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,690
I'll have to follow Master's decision.

623
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,640
Cheers.

627
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,280
It's your last day.

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,040
Here.

629
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,810
You did a great job.

630
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,490
You didn't have to bring me flowers.

631
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,550
My wife is retiring
as the hospital chairwoman,

632
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,270
so you deserve
a flower bouquet at the least.

633
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,590
The board will make their decision soon.

634
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,480
Oh, right.

635
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,570
Now that the network
has picked up the show,

636
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,680
won't you be too busy with work
to go on dates with me?

637
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,580
I'll always make time to see you.

638
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,710
But Mr. Han is focused on
other things than writing.

639
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,900
He's infatuated with Joo-in.

640
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,340
So who are you rooting for?

641
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,690
-Mr. Han or Director Jeong?
-I'm rooting for Director Jeong.

642
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,750
At first, I thought they were
pretending to be dating,

643
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,180
but Director Jeong seems to have
real feelings for her.

644
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,210
He treats her like a goddess.

645
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,360
From simply being friends
to becoming her boyfriend...

646
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,010
He knew her for 14 years. How romantic.

647
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,110
I'm rooting for Mr. Han, of course.

648
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,960
He's a cold-hearted guy,

649
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,180
but all of a sudden,
he turned into a hopeless romantic.

650
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,660
It doesn't get as romantic as that.

651
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,310
So this is where we disagree.

652
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,830
I'm not changing my position.

653
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,610
How is Han Bi-soo attractive as a guy?

654
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,410
He's always angry. Glaring eyes.

655
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,590
He's all smiles nowadays.

656
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,350
-He always yells at me.
-You haven't seen him recently.

657
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,040
-I entrust the hospital with you.
-Please come to visit.

658
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,590
Everyone is sad to see you leave.

659
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,740
I'm not going anywhere.
You'll always find me here.

660
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,010
So call me if you need anything.

661
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,300
What if I stay up all night drinking
like I did in my college days?

662
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,430
Come on.

663
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,960
Go ahead. It won't hurt.

664
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,350
If you hadn't supported me,

665
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,420
I don't think I would be here today.

666
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,520
I love you, Hae-jin.

667
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,630
I'm always on your side.

668
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,140
Me too.

669
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,640
Sang-eun, you made working here
a lot more enjoyable.

670
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,370
Thanks, Sang-eun.

671
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,980
What if we let your mom and my mom

672
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,840
stay over in the guest room?

673
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,100
I think it would make them happy

674
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,160
and bring back good memories.

675
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,350
You're coming up with a lot of
good suggestions.

676
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,830
Writer Han, seek my advice.

677
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,060
I'm talented in many things.

678
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,290
Have a nice day at the hospital.

679
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,090
You too.

680
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,830
[Chairwoman Kang Hae-jin]

681
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,300
Finally, it's my last day.

682
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,570
Is this all you need to pack?

683
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,130
You don't have any more stuff?

684
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,110
I realize I didn't keep
much stuff in my office.

685
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,540
Don't dwell on that kind of stuff.

686
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,430
Just focus on how you'll enjoy

687
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,420
your retirement
and do the things you want in life.

688
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,800
Yes, I will.

689
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,580
-Bi-soo.
-Yes?

690
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,440
Are things going well?

691
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,100
It seems like
everything is going well, but...

692
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,530
Why are you asking me that suddenly?

693
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,300
What are you talking about?

694
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,820
I'm talking about Joo-in.

695
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,850
I read an article that says
she's dating someone.

696
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,740
Now you're bringing it up?

697
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,300
It would affect you the most.

698
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,360
I didn't want to make things
worse for you.

699
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,830
It's fake.

700
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,730
-It's fake?
-It's not true.

701
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,960
A reporter was going to run
a story that Master and I

702
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,650
were living together. So they released
a fake story to bury that.

703
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,840
Then who is Jeong Yu-jin?

704
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,190
He's an old friend of Master.

705
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,830
They knew each other in high school.

706
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,360
Why did you just call her Master?

707
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,410
What?

708
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,640
Well...

709
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,750
She calls me Writer Han,

710
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,770
so I call her Master.

711
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,830
It's only fair.

712
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,890
I thought you were really something,

713
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,530
but Joo-in is on a different level.

714
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,090
-I mean, Master.
-What?

715
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,660
-What?
-Your face is beet red.

716
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,010
What? Isn't it right though?

717
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,330
Oh, my.

718
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,750
How pretty.

719
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,590
-A lot of work went into this.
-Obviously.

720
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,660
Joo-in spent hours decorating the place.

721
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,720
How could I not love you
when you prepare something like this?

722
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,080
Can I just call her Joo-in?

723
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,640
Of course. Don't call her, Ms. Oh.
She's my daughter, after all.

724
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,400
I feel more comfortable
if you call me that.

725
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,830
Thanks, Joo-in.

726
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,640
Is someone else coming?

727
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,380
What on earth?

728
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,190
You never miss a party.

729
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,670
I would never miss
a special day like this.

730
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,490
Come in, Chang-gyu.

731
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,130
Welcome.

732
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,280
-Ta-da.
-Thanks so much.

733
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,220
-Isn't it pretty?
-I love it.

734
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,360
Hae-jin, you worked so hard
in your career.

735
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,510
Even running a record store
isn't a piece of cake.

736
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,150
I can't imagine running a hospital.

737
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,160
I grew up in a family of doctors.

738
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,260
Hospital work is all I'm good at.

739
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,240
When people compliment you,
just accept it without a word.

740
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,710
- Okay.
- Yes, Hae-jin.

741
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,860
Now make a wish.

742
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,010
I made a wish on my birthday though.
I'm a lucky woman.

743
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,690
I get to make more wishes.

744
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,490
Making wishes is a good thing.

745
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,340
And the chances of them coming true go up.

746
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,850
-Congratulations on your retirement!
-You had a great career!

747
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,780
-Thanks.
-What did you wish for?

748
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,870
What?

749
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,870
I wished that each and every one of you
would find happiness.

750
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,380
You didn't have to wish for us.

751
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,400
-Just wish for something you wanted.
-She did well.

752
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,020
Having the people around her
become happy will make her happy.

753
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,200
You should come to my store often now.

754
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,640
-Will you serve tea?
-Tea and much more.

755
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,790
I'll play records for you
and be your friend.

756
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,220
Ta-da. A present.

757
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,880
You're doing so much for me lately.
I'm so touched.

758
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,190
Open it. I want to know
what he got for you.

759
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,290
Not now. Open it in the guest room.

760
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,390
-And wear it for us.
-Oh, my. I think it's clothes.

761
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,580
-Put it on. Let's go.
-Wait for us.

762
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,670
What are you staring at?

763
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,080
My mom was your first love, right?
Are you excited?

764
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,810
Don't say such things!

765
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,900
All right.

766
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,010
-Ta-da.
-Wow.

767
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,440
You look stunning, Mom.

768
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,670
Hae-jin, you still have it!

769
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,520
That color fits you so well.

770
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,320
-You look wonderful.
-I do?

771
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,250
Bi-soo has good tastes.

772
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,350
You're lucky

773
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,910
to have a son who gives you
beautiful presents.

774
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,080
Thanks, Bi-soo.

775
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,990
I don't know why you always
stuck with wearing black.

776
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,220
I'll buy you a lot of dresses, Mom.
In different colors.

777
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,620
I won't

778
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,850
ever forget this day.

779
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,540
Hold still.

780
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,660
Mr. Han, don't you feel like
having a drink?

781
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,150
Yes. We didn't drink during the party.

782
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,190
[Thanks to you,
this special day was possible.]

783
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,380
[Thanks to you,
this special day was possible.]

784
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,900
[I merely provided the venue.]

785
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:49,870
[I merely provided the venue.]

786
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,260
[You also provided a priceless memory.]

787
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,440
[You also provided a priceless memory.]

788
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,170
[You're the best, Master.]

789
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,940
[What kind of snacks do you like?]

790
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,140
[Dried snacks.]

791
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,640
What? Joo-in? You're Joo-in, right?

792
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,860
Yes.

793
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,540
Are you Writer Han Bi-soo?

794
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,840
Are you together?

795
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,090
We met by coincidence.
I live in this neighborhood.

796
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,440
We're close.

797
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,030
We're working together on a show.

798
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,250
Oh, right.

799
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,810
I read the news.

800
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,530
Oh, so you're very close.

801
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,090
Yes. Hope you'll watch our show.

802
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,640
Of course, I will.

803
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,310
Cheers.

804
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,350
Why did you tell him that we're close?

805
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,660
-But it's true.
-Yes.

806
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,060
It's funny.

807
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,320
I feel better after you said that.

808
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,420
-Quite strange, isn't it?
-What is?

809
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,100
That our mothers know each other.

810
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,670
And that we both owned
this house at different periods.

811
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,710
It seems like we're on the same timeline.

812
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,550
Yes, you're right.

813
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,750
-Coffee?
-I'd like that.

814
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,810
Our moms left early.

815
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,570
Smells good.

816
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,010
What is your mom planning to do now?

817
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,780
When people retire after a long career,

818
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,670
they have a hard time choosing
what to do with their lives.

819
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,980
My mom has it all planned out.

820
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,750
On what she'll do.

821
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,510
Sir, what service do you
provide to customers?

822
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,780
Oh, it's coming right up.

823
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,930
Thank you for coming to

824
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,520
Just Record Cafe again.

825
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,340
I see I have two customers.

826
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,910
For two close friends,

827
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,310
I prepared this music.

828
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,400
Yes, Sang-eun.

829
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,220
It feels great to not go to work.

830
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,170
It's loud here, isn't it? Hold on.

831
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,510
I am having so much fun. It's great.

832
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,370
DJ Chang-gyu, I'm counting on you
to bring the beat.

833
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,710
Okay.

834
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,570
Chang-gyu, where is the restroom?

835
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,550
It's down the hallway.

836
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,190
That was a short call.

837
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,970
My work friend called.
She asked me how retirement feels.

838
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,150
-You should've told her it's fun.
-I know.

839
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,340
I should've quit my job sooner
if I had known how good retirement is.

840
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,190
Where's Jung-hwa?

841
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,280
She went to the restroom.

842
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,420
What? By herself?

843
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:27,560
Yes.

844
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,240
Jung-hwa...

845
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,100
Jung-hwa. She's not answering her phone.
Oh, no.

846
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,160
-Chang-gyu, where is the restroom?
-What's the matter?

847
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,170
I can't let her go by herself.

848
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,600
What's going on?

849
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,740
Jung-hwa

850
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,840
has Alzheimer's. She can get lost.

851
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,910
What is she talking about?

852
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,720
Yes, Mom.

853
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,990
How is your first day unemployed?

854
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,260
What?

855
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,100
Joo-in's mom?

856
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,670
Okay. We'll look for her too.

857
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,310
What was that call about?

858
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,680
Your mother disappeared.

859
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,320
What should we do?

860
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,000
-Stay here.
-What are you saying? I have to find her.

861
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,350
She might find her way here.

862
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,990
People are looking for her.

863
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,710
So you should stay home.

864

You need to stay calm
in moments like these.

865
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,880
She's probably doing okay.

866
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,560
I can't stay home.

867
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,860
Where are you going?

868
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,250
I want to comb the neighborhood.

869
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,960
Isn't that Oh Joo-in?

870
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,190
-Is it her?
-That's Oh Joo-in.

-Joo-in!
-I'm calling to report

874
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,110

-Mom.
-What should we do?

Hold on.

877
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,360
She must be her daughter. She'll be okay.

878
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,620
She'll be all right.

879

That's Writer Han. You don't remember?

Not me.

888
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,020
She must be your favored student.
You even invited her over.

889

She keeps calling me Mom. How endearing.

It must hurt a lot.

She can't recognize her own daughter.
It's so cruel.

I know. I feel so bad.

Thank you all for looking for my mother.

I'm sorry, Joo-in.

I should've stayed
by her side at all times.

You should get some rest.
It was a long day for you.

Bye.

916
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,650
I knew the day would come

917
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,380
when my mom
wouldn't be able to recognize me.

918
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,170
But I thought that day would be far away.

919
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,340
Even if she didn't recognize other people,

920
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,930
I thought she'd

921
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,220
be able to remember me.

922
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,120
I told myself that.

I couldn't handle the day

924

that would happen to her.

925
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:11,670

you can

927
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,420
handle it without a problem.

928
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,620
Your mother is so thoughtful.

929
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,730
She assigned you a different role
to keep things interesting.

930

Today, she thought you were

she'll give you next time.

I'm relieved that I'm an actress.

938
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,690
I'm confident in playing a daughter role.

939
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,710
And I could play other roles too.

940
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,780
I'll be able to keep her amused.

Thanks to her,
you'll improve as an actress.

Even if the day comes

when Mom will completely forget who I am,
I'll remember her.
