Bi-soo, do you remember
the first show we produced? "One Target"?

163
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,870
How could I forget that?
It was my first show.

164
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,930
Your script was leaked,
and a copycat show came out right away.

165
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,950
So you rewrote the whole script
in one week.

166
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,760
You developed bald spots and
suffered from nosebleeds.

Since when did writers ever
pitch a show to an actor?

You're not the only one so special.

She can't take a hint?

If we can get her on board, I'm hoping
to do a romantic comedy with her later.

I met you at the award ceremony last year.

191
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,790
I won the Best Actress Award,
and you won the Best Screenplay.

193

I can't figure out
why an award-winning actress

as the second choice?

a replacement yet.

I turned you down twice before.

204
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,850
The first time, I was a newcomer.

205
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,580
And three years ago, I was the most
wanted talent among advertisers.

However, some said my acting was lacking.

But now it's different.
I won two Best Actress Awards.

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,909
Pork again?

484
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,350
I like tuna in the stew better.

485
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,699
Mom, you always make what Dad likes.

486
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,989
Today is a big day for your dad.

487

That's for later.

490

I want your homemade cooking, Mom.

491

What are you doing?

495
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm guilty as charged. I'm so sorry.

496
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,570
I'll clean it up.

497
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,430
I got hungry,
so I was snacking on this rice cake.

498
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,400
Stop spewing apologies.

499
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,620
Take a look at that.

500
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,380
You finished episode three?

501
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,140
You didn't eat all day to work on this.

502
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,660
And it's finished.

503
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,390
-Of course it is.
-The producer will be so happy.

504
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,810
I'll send this to him right away.

505
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,620
By the way, they'll start
shooting tomorrow.

You're coming too, right?

507
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,360
You can go without me.

508
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,560
Scalpel.

509
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,090
What's wrong? Do you want me to take over?

510
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,520
Are you skilled at killing people?

511
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,700
What?

512
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,180
Cut. We were doing fine.

513
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,190
What happened?

514
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,840
Ji-yeon, what's going on?
Is there anything wrong?

515
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,730
-Producer.
-Yes.

516
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,870
How about we change the scene

517
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,440
so that Ki-chan takes
the scalpel away from me?

518
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,250
-We can't do that.
-Come on.

519
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,640
What if we just try it once?

520
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,130
Producer, please. Just once.

521
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,320
Well, we can try that just once.

522

Thanks, Producer.

523
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,930
-Don't mention it.
-Thank you, my foot.

524
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,860
Mr. Han, you can talk to
the producer privately...

525
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,580
Who said you could change the script?

526
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,410
Well, in certain tricky situations,

527
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,720
we make script changes sometimes.

528
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,980
You have a nice smile.

529
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,580
I think you're talented in that.

530
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,230
-Excuse me?
-But why can't you direct the actors?

531
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,630
You were like her babysitter.

532
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,570
Babysitter? What did you just say?
Are you done talking?

533
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,090
No, I'm just getting started.

534

-Producer!

536
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,110
Kim Ji-yeon,

537
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,460
this is a scene
where you're operating on the killer

538
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,480
who murdered your parents.

539
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,150
-Why don't you also change the lead role?
-I'm the lead actress.

540
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,660
This is very inappropriate.

541
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,930
Act like a lead actress then.

542
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,110
Why were you trembling?

543
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,460
You're about to decide
whether to kill your nemesis or not.

544
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,270
It's an intense scene.

545
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,080
And that's all you can do?

546
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,360
I came on board just recently.

547
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,580
It takes you time to write
a script, doesn't it?

548
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,350
It's the same with acting. It takes time.

549
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,990
Fine, I'll give you some slack.

550
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,170
Why are you wearing so much makeup?

551
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,190
You're in an operating room setting.

552

This is important--

Fine, that's for your cosmetic sponsor.

I stayed up all night writing that script.

Then show me. Give me a real performance.

-Just pick it up.

-No!

about doing that show, are you?

00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,640
It's the same. The place is clean.

645
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,240
And it's in better condition
than it was in before.

646
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,870
You did well.

647
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,450
I think I did a great job too.

648
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,910
Mom, what do you want to do
once we move there?

649
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,350
What do you want to do? Say something.

650
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,380
I'm not moving there.

651
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,020
What do you mean?

652
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,330
I don't want to be a burden,
living together.

653
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,180
I've been at this nursing home
for four years.

654
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,910
This place is more comfortable for me.

655
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,720
But I can't be around you
if you stay here.

656
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,610
I know it's sad, but it can't be helped.

657
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,550
I'm not changing my mind no matter what.

658
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,250
I'm leaving.

659
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,890
She was the reason I bought this house.

660
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,540
Why...

661
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,580
Why did you tell the chief
that I rejected Oh Joo-in?

662
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,400
You're supposed to negotiate with him.

663
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,370
Why did you tell on me?

664
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,080
Oh Joo-in hasn't committed to
any show yet.

665
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,400
Bi-soo, we still have a chance
to make this show.

666
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,330
Sure.

667
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:11,520
If you apologize and persuade her,
we can do this--

668
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,670
That's a great plan.
I turned her down three times.

669
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,900
If I were her, I wouldn't say yes
even if they begged on their knees.

670
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,210
You're open to the idea
of begging on your knees?

671
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,470
What?

672
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,780
It's doable.

673
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,180
-We can do it.
-Do what?

674
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,820
Go talk to Oh Joo-in.

675
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:33,480
Apologize and beg on your knees.
That's not embarrassing at all.

676
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,790
Are you out of your mind?

677
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,400
I have a bad feeling about this.

678
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,360
Whether to get on my knees or not.

679
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,230
But I'll protect these knees.

680
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,550
What is it, Mom?

681
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,860
[I'm disappointed.]

682
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,920
You really forgot what day it is today?

683
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,390
What is today?

684
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,470
Of course, I know.

685
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,280
I was just pretending to not know.

686
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,800
Can't I kid around?

687
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,940
Mom.

688
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,110
Come in.

689
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,710
Mom.

690
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,150
Happy birthday.

691
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,660
Thanks.

692
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,100
Here.

693
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,370
-What is it?
-Here.

694
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,710
What kind of gift is it?

695
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,420
-Is it a necklace? A bracelet?
-I'm not telling you.

696
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,610
I wonder what it is.

697
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,770
A fountain pen?

698
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,670
So you didn't forget my birthday
after all.

699
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,930
[HJ]

700
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,750
I wanted the director at Sein Hospital
to sign all her documents in style.

701
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,690
Your son is a top scriptwriter,
so you can scribble notes down.

702
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,950
Or use it for writing shopping lists.

703
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,520
-It'll come in handy.
-Sure.

704
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,830
What is this?

705
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,540
[Thank you for being my mom.
Let's go on a trip on your next birthday.]

706
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,920
Yes. I would love to go on a trip
on my next birthday.

707
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,540
But there's one more present
I would like to have.

708
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,970
My room?

709
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,660
Is this present in the room?

710
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,680
Bi-soo, come live here with us.

711
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,570
I'm not a kangaroo joey.

712
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:47,840
Why would I jump back
into a pouch and live here?

713
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,700
While you were in a coma at the hospital,

714
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,090
I worried that it could be
the last time I'd ever see you.

715
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,400
I prayed that it wouldn't be.

716
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,800
You don't know what can happen in life.

717
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,330
Can you live with us
until you get married?

718
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,400
I want to see you get along
with your dad like you used to.

719
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,630
We're not the only family
that is like this.

720
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,850
Fathers and sons have
an awkward relationship.

721
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,670
I find it strange
when people smile superficially

722
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,180
at family get-togethers.

723
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,820
Come on, Bi-soo.

724
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,120
[Han Bi-soo]

725
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,220
[My folks think I'm on a school trip.]

726
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,570
They're always
at the hospital at this hour.

727
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,420
I'll bring the most expensive whiskey
so wait there for me.

728
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,340
[Go ahead and tell your mom what you saw.]

729
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,410
[But that will make your mom cry.
She'll be very sad.]

730
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,090
[Do you understand what I'm saying?]

731
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,710
What are you doing tomorrow?

732
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,810
Are you going to be working
at home all day?

733
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,030
Yes.

734
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,260
I want to just focus on writing,
but people won't leave me alone.

735
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,120
Are you talking about the tabloids?

736
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,540
I don't care about those.

737
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,140
Don't let it bother you either, Mom.

738
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,450
-You're here, Bi-soo?
-Honey.

739
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,410
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

740
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,720
Mom can be so...

741
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,790
It would be great if she would go with me.

742
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,160
We meet again so soon
after you were hospitalized.

743
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,430
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for Mom's birthday.

744
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,380
They say your show will be canceled.

745
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,620
Are you saying that out of concern
or are you taunting me?

746
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,970
What kind of dad would not want
their son to succeed?

747
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,490
Everyone at the hospital
knows I'm your dad.

748
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,590
So don't dishonor the family.

749
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:36,130
Is it true what the tabloids are saying?
Did you assault the actress?

750
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,230
Do you want to believe it's true?

751
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,530
You're not planning to move in, are you?

752
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,630
-Why do you ask?
-If you do move in,

753
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,650
I hope things don't get uncomfortable.

754
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,390
What were you two talking about?

755
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,810
I was complimenting him
about his success as a scriptwriter.

756
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,250
And I tried to convince him to move in.

757
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,590
Why are you leaving so soon?

758
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,320
I only came to see you.

759
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,460
Then stay a little longer
and eat your meal with me.

760
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,890
You're an awful cook, Mom.

761
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,120
I'll treat you to lunch
at a restaurant next time, okay?

762
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,390
Bi-soo, you're going to move in, right?

763
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,120
-Let's do that, okay?
-Gosh.

764
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,810
Your mom wants you to move in.
So stay with us.

765
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,690
I'll call you later.

Yes, Ms. Kang.

768
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,920
I moved everything out of the house.

769
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,150
So you can move in now.

770
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,170
Sorry for causing so much trouble.

771
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,690
Not at all. Thank you.

-No, ma'am.

Yes, Ms. Kim.

[President Kim Yi-na]

You got your old home back.

You probably can't express it in words.

I've got more good news for you.

779

Sorry? Han Bi-soo's agency wants me
to be in their show?

780
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,470
I talked to Oh Joo-in's agency
and offered her the role.

781
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,320
But I think they'll reject us.

782
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,910
They didn't sound eager.

783
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,160
If we can't sign Oh Joo-in,
this show will be canceled.

-No way!
-Just once.

-No.
-Just this once.

789

Hi, Joo-in.

I'm so hungry.

792

That's why I told you to eat
your breakfast before going to school.

793
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,040
You never listen to me.

It smells so good.

796
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,520
Your kimchi stew is the best.

-In his study. The deadline is tomorrow.

00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,720
I used all my allowance.

804
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,320
I couldn't just buy one snack
for myself with my friends around.

805
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,060
Oh, that's tragic.

806
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,990

What?

809
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,510
Don't tell your mom.

810
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,770
Thank you!

811
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,620
I'm going to ask Mom for an allowance too.

812
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,680
I'll call you when dinner is ready.

813
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,610
Meet your deadline, Mr. Oh.

814
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,710
Sure.

815
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,220
Oh, dear.

816
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,570
Just wait a little longer, Dad.

817
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,390
I'll bring Mom home.

818
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,630
What are you doing?

819
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,860
You surprised me, you punk.

820
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,800
I'm more surprised than you.

821
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,700
-What were you doing?
-I can't do this right.

822
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,930
You're so weird.

823
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,910
It's all good.

824
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,510
I can't get this right.

825
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,640

829
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,480
I still can't believe it.

830
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,540
How did I get this house back?

831
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,200
You worked so hard to buy this house.

832
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,630
When we lost the house, I was devastated.

833
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,060
You're amazing.

834
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,390
You rose to the top after hitting
rock bottom. Now you're a top actress.

835
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:34,270
So how dare Han Bi-soo
humiliate me like that?

836
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,700
-You won't respond to his offer, right?
-I will eventually.

837
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,100
I'll let him simmer and wait.

838
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,200
And then turn him down at the very end.

839
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,190
So you have a plan.

840
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,870
-Let's drink to that.
-Let's drink.

841
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,720
We'll drink till we drop.

842

-Something is bothering you, right?
-No.

843
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,650
Mr. Kim, pour me a drink, will you?

844
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,500
-That's enough.
-I won't do anything crazy.

and cry in the listening room again?

848
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,480
I could give you some privacy if you want.

849
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,760
You're killing my buzz.

850
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,730
Why do you have to bring that up?

851
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,430
It feels like it was just yesterday
when you were a kid coming here.
