What did you just say?

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,690
I'll repeat it.

Let's end this.

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,350
-Do you mean it?
-Yes.

10
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,410
You don't mean it. I can tell.

11

Stop acting like you know me.

This is how I really feel.

I can't accept it. This is too sudden.

You never listen to me.
Why do I have to listen?

You remember the wish I had?

It's my wish.

I didn't come to this house to date you.

And so?

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,479
It's true that I found you attractive.

26
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,509
I needed inspiration to
write romantic plots for the show.

27
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,150
So I used you.

28

But I don't need your help anymore.

Why?

30

You're so dependent
as if you can't live without me.

31

I'm tired of that.

It's up to you.

You can tell yourself that I probably
have another reason for acting like this.

That's one way to cope.

But it's only going to make you miserable.

37

Stop it. You're saying things
you'll regret later.

Why don't we take
a morning stroll together?

47

You forgot the conversation
we had last night?

48
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,140
I do remember it.
And you were under a lot of stress.

49
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,240
Exercise is good for dealing with stress.

You'll feel a lot better

You should've played hard to get. You're
the queen of romantic comedies, after all.

You fell head over heels for him.
You made your feelings too obvious.

That's what you did wrong.

79

He's got these personal issues that
he doesn't handle well.

80

Afterward, he apologizes for his behavior.

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,120
Maybe I wasn't more supportive.

82

There you go again.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,900
You shouldn't blame that on yourself.

Those are his issues.

85
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,930
There's one thing that bothers me.

What?

87
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,500
The last time he apologized to me,

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,820
he said he couldn't tell me
why he was going through a difficult time.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,730
I think that's relevant to

Sure. Why not?

96

You said you'd only
put your arms around me.

Of course.

in your arms, didn't you?

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,250
Mom, it's not a competition.

Hey, Bi-soo.

101
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,140
I haven't seen you in years.

It's been a while.

103

Hello. How are you doing?

104
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,110
Do you remember me? I'm Hee-jung.

105

How do you two know each other?

108

Bi-soo had a crush on me.

109
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,220
You had high standards
even when you were a kid.

110
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,150
Dr. Oh was your first crush?

111

-You became a doctor, I see.
-Yes.

112
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,050
I met her at a seminar.

113
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,150
She wrote a paper
on cystic diseases of the pancreas.

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,460
She also won
the Breakthrough Researcher prize.

115
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm trying to recruit her to our hospital.

116
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm seriously considering your offer.

117
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,040
Bi-soo, why aren't you saying anything?

118
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,730
I don't have much to add.

119
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,470
Can't you see? He wants us to excuse
ourselves so that he can talk to her.

120
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,180
Your mother looked unwell.

121
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,110
Yes.

122
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,540
It must be hard.

123
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,980
She's the one who's suffering.

124
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,140
When you're dealing with an illness
in the family,

125
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,770
it's good to have supportive friends.

126
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,590
Are you dating anyone?

127
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,070
-No.
-What?

128
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,130
You really don't have a girlfriend?

129
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,770
I broke up with her.

130
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,890
Looks like you separated amicably.

131
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,200
It wouldn't be easy to talk about it
if it was a difficult breakup.

132
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,440
I hope Mr. Han will get along
with the producer.

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,830
We can't have Mr. Han
create a scandal like the last time

134
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,429
when he shoved an actress.

135
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,530
He didn't shove her.

136
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,679
It turned out she was at fault too.

137
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,700
You're taking his side again.

138
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,020
The new producer is talented
and gets along with people,

139
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,700
so I think the show
will get solid ratings.

140
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,810
I'm going to produce my best work.

141
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,170
Cheers.

142
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,970
Will Bi-soo also be present
when we meet the producer?

143
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,310
Why are you asking me?

144
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,120
You would know that.

145
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,150
I didn't ask him.

146
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,500
He doesn't like meetings.

147
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,660
[Joo-in, come out and have a drink.]

148
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,310
Did you have a few drinks already?

149
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,080
Oh, you're here too.

150
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,520
You didn't know I was with him?

151
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,580
No.

152
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,380
I have something to say to you.
That's why I called you both.

153
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,360
What is it? That's a long pause.

154
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,770
Yu-jin, you still like
Joo-in a lot, right?

155
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,760
That's obvious to everyone.

156
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,390
What kind of question is that?

157
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,750
You should date for real now.

158
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,610
I'm no longer interested in Joo-in.

159
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,890
Bi-soo, watch your words.

160
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,300
Bi-soo, you're such a disappointment.

161
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,360
Ending things like this
isn't fair to Joo-in no matter what.

162
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,630
What's the point
when I'll break up with her anyway?

163
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,140
It's good news for you.

164
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,910
So why are you angry? This is your chance.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,430
Stop it.

166
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,510
-I have limits to my patience.
-No need to hold back.

167
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,780
You don't have to be nice to me anymore.

168
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,290
I hope you two will hit it off.

169
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,750
I mean it.

170
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm sorry for storming out like that.

171
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,200
You don't need to apologize.

172
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,950
You still like him
despite what he just said?

173
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,050
Ask him to leave your house.

174
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm worried about you getting hurt.

175
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,050
His lease isn't over yet.

176
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,250
Think it over.

177
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,350
Obsessing over someone
who has turned his back on you

178
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,450
isn't love.
That's just feelings of regret.

179
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm going in.

180
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,510
No need to get off.

181
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,920

184
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,780
Bi-soo, we need to talk.

185
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,970
Why are you avoiding me?

186
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,190
Because you might get weak
if you look at me?

187
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,370
You still have something to say to me?

188
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,820
Sit down and wait until I finish eating.

189
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,200
You think I'll change my mind
if I remember the time

190
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,510
we shared a bowl of noodles?

191
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,370
Don't try looking sad.

192
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,290
Ask him to leave your house.

193
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,350

It's good news for you.

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,070
So why are you angry? This is your chance.

197
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,800
-Thanks.
-Having the right posture

198
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,520
when exercising is important.

199
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,760
Now grip it the right way.

1, 2...

201
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,060
When you lift it, don't hesitate.
Push yourself.

202
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,690
Maintain control of your muscles.

203
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,950
One.

204
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,380
Nothing is easy.

205
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,790
You've set a goal
for your weight training.

206
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,570
As long as you stick to the routine,
you'll reach your goal.

207
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,490
I've never overseen a show
with so many issues like this before.

208
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,180
They say, "Happy events are often
accompanied by difficulties."

209
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,910
Indeed. I'm the comeback kid.

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,010
So the show is in good hands now.

211
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,200
Right. Bi-soo said he worked
very hard on the script

212
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,130
as if it were his last masterpiece.

213
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,640
This show will be a hit.

214
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,610
I'm sorry for being late.

215
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,600
You've changed a lot.
You usually don't say sorry.

216
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,700
-Please give it your best.
-I will. It's an honor.

217
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,660
Long time no see, Joo-in.

218
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,470
It's nice to see you again.

219
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,540
You seem to be totally immersed
in your character.

220
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,980
You have an edgier look.

221
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,570
Doesn't she?

222
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,020
There's something different
about her, right?

223
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,950
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

224
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,270
You look very tired.
Did you stay up all night?

225
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,870
I'm quite tired.

226
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,020
There's this person
who won't take no for an answer.

227
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,660
That must be frustrating.

228
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,600
People need to know when to quit it.

229
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,730
Don't you think so?

230
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,140
So when will the shooting begin?

231
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,760
We'll have the actors
undergo training first.

232
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,660
Hello, Ms. Kim.

233
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,470
Hi, Mr. Yoo.

234
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,240
Are you aware of the meeting
with the producer?

235
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,760
Yes. They'll start shooting
the show at last.

[President Kim Yi-na]

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,910
Yes.

238
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,550
I'll be on my way then.

239
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,060
What? That's it?

240
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,630
I was wondering if you hurt your fingers.

241
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,840
So I came to check.

242
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,020
But they look fine.

243
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,290
-What?
-I was waiting for you to call me.

244
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,890
Oh, I forgot.

245
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,120
I said I would treat you to dinner before.

246
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,070
You can forget other things,
but having dinner is very important.

247
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,870
We work to put food
on the table, don't we?

248
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
How about dinner tonight?

249
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,440
I'll call you to tell you
when's a good time.

250
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,130
I have to go into a meeting right now.

251
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,570
Oh, I see.

252
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,140
I'll get going then.

253
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,640
He acts like a little boy.

254
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,910
That's cute.

255
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,710
Shooting will begin soon.

256
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,930
It feels like it was just yesterday
when I brokered a deal

257
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,150
to put Joo-in in the lead.

258
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,760
Casting Joo-in in the lead
was a terrific decision.

259
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,640
I thought you reluctantly agreed to it
or else the show would have been dropped.

260
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,950
I almost made a big mistake.

261
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,140
I drew a lot of inspiration
from you while writing the scripts.

262
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,130
-In what way?
-The character is very similar to you.

263
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,030
On the surface, she's very strong,
but inside, she harbors pain and anguish.

264
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,810
And she's someone who will cling to a guy

265
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,000
who doesn't like her.
Like a blind obsession.

266
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,740
I have a different take on the character.

267
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,510
I think she's someone
who doesn't easily give up.

268
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,820
You could say she is afraid
of being alone.

269
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,820
People who had a lonely childhood
are usually like that.

270
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,550
Did you have a childhood like that too?

271
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,010
I like this profound discussion
we're having.

272
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,840
I hate to dampen the mood,
but I need to go.

273

I have another meeting to attend.

274
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,780

What is it?

286
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,130
It's a floral pattern.

287
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,190
I love it.

288
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,070
-Does it look pretty?
-It looks great on you.

289

There's something
I'd like to return to you.

290

Joo-in, can I ask you something?

291
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,670
And be totally honest in your answer.

292

Sure. Ask me anything.

She said I'm the only one
you'll have left.

324
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,340
-Why did Mom say that?
-So I decided

325
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,870
to stay committed
even if you act mean to me.

326
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,610
Hold my hand if you think the same.

327
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,080
It's my mom's, so it's hers to give to
whomever she wants.

328
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,060
But don't wear it when I'm around.
It bothers me.

329
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,750
What bothers you is a good thing.

330
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,050
You keep bringing up my past comments.

331
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,360
Don't you have any pride?

332
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,650
Until I figure out
why you don't want to be around me,

333
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,890
I'm going to forget my pride.

334
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,190
-Oh, you went to get coffee?
-Yes.

335
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,590
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've gone with you.

336
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,100
Thanks.

337
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,830
I wanted to get her autograph.

338
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,300
I thought you were friends.

339
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,650
Writers and actors don't get along well.

340
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,050
Then why would she visit your mom
if she's not a friend?

341
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,520
Her mom knows my mom.

342
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,550
Why did you suddenly talk so nice to me?

343
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,310
Ms. Oh might have thought we were dating.

344
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,650
No, she wouldn't.

345
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,140
-Gwang-ja.
-Yes?

346
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,300
Could you close your eyes for a moment?

347
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,730
Why are you asking me that?

348
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,830
Just close your eyes.

349
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,280
I wasn't asking you to kiss me.

350
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,810
But it's going to happen now.

351
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,910
Just a minute.

352
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,100
-Now open your eyes.
-So soon?

353
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,020
I'll always be in the palm
of your hands, Gwang-ja.

354
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,500
Well, that's nice, but...

355
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,520
I have to return the gesture.

356
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,040
That's a kiss with interest.

357
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,130
Then this is...
Interest on top of the interest.

358

[-Oh, you went to get coffee?
-Yes.]

359
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,690
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've gone with you.

360
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,230
Did you see Joo-in?

361
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,910
No, I only saw Hee-jung.

362
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,940
Hee-jung hasn't changed.
She's still bright and full of energy.

363
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,710
She hasn't changed much.

364
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,480
Why did you two break up?

365

[Absolute Bed Rest]

366
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,350
I don't know.
She said she wanted to end it.

367
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,800
And I didn't particularly
think that she was the one.

368
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,790
What about Joo-in? Is she the one for you?

369
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,450
[Come to Dali Restaurant at 6 p.m.]

370
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,970
[I'll wait there until you show up.]

371
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,980
Hurry up and say you're sorry.

372
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,350
-What?
-You think I didn't notice

373
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,620
that you're fighting?

374
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,180
Mom, actually, we--

375
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,330
Of course, there must be a reason
why you fought.

376
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,130
But you know what? You forget
why you even fought later on.

377
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,000
There are three sentences

378
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,710
that you shouldn't use sparingly
to people you care about.

379
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,670
I'm sorry. Thank you. I love you.

380
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,920
Joo-in told me that she loves you.

381
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,730
She cares about you.
So don't take her for granted.

382
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,350
Is there anyone else than her
who's special to you?

383
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,700
As long as the secret isn't about
some other girl, I'll give you a pass.

384
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,350
-Nice to meet you, Joo-in.
-Oh, hello.

385
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,670
I'm Oh Hee-jung. A friend of Bi-soo's.

386
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,310
She was my first crush.

387
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,330
You don't have to mention that.

388
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,860
I told Bi-soo that I'm a big fan of yours,

389
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,750
so he suggested that I come along.

390
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,250
-I see.
-You look prettier in person.

391
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,380
Thank you.

392
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,440
You're the cutest couple
in the nation, you know.

393
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,750
Yu-jin and Joo-in
make a great couple, don't they?

394
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,380
Shall we order?

395
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,840
[What would you like?]

396
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,030
I'm not a picky eater.

397
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,150
Then how about going
to my favorite restaurant?

398
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,130
Sure. Sounds great.

399
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,880
That felt like touching an electric eel.

400
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,150
An electric eel?

401
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,470
Grilled eel is delicious.

402
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,940
Let's have that next time.

403
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,220
There's going to be a next time?

404
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,960
I didn't know the words "next time"
could make a person feel so good.

405
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,320
Here, have this.

406
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,000
You're not good at cutting a steak.

407
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,310
What's the occasion? Such chivalry.

408
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,410
-Thanks.
-Sure.

409
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,190
Joo-in, you haven't touched your steak.

410
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,520
I have to watch what I eat
before shooting begins.

411
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,550
It must be difficult to just stare
at such a juicy steak.

412
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,830
It is a bit unpleasant.

413
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,770
Someone like me can never date guys.

414
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,590
But did you know we have
something in common?

415
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,700
We share the last name, "Oh".

416
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,610
No wonder I found Joo-in
to be familiar when we first met.

417
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,690
Are you dating anyone, Hee-jung?

418
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,580
No.

419
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,890
I can't get back with Bi-soo.

420
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
Why not? If it happens, it happens.

421
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,020
Could I excuse myself?
I have another schedule.

422
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,030
Thank you for this dinner.

423
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,220
Next time, let me treat you
to a nice dinner.

424
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,770
Sure.

425
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,200
What was that?

426
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,220
You said you weren't friends.
It didn't seem so.

427
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,450
I only saw her a few times in meetings.

428
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,930
You're into her, aren't you?

429
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,750
You know she's dating
a cosmetics company executive.

430
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,770
You were acting really nice to me.

431
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,870
As if you were trying to make her jealous.

432
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,800
No, I wasn't.

433
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,360
If you say so.

434
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,570
You made my heart flutter earlier.

435
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,160
-Joo-in.
-What?

436
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,000
Why are you sitting out here?

437
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,070
I like watching people coming and going.

438
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,860
Being alone in your room
is lonely, isn't it?

439
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:55,620
It's probably a lot harder
for Bi-soo right now.

440
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,980
His mood is affecting you too right?

441
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,290
A little.

442
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,730
Seems like it's really tough.

443
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,440
-How about we have some tea?
-I'd like that.

444
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,080
Wait a minute.

445
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,750
Ta-da.

446
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,530
Where were you?

447
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,760
I got you tea.

448
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,670
Joo-in, don't abandon me.

449
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,440
What's wrong?

450
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,960
Your dad left me.

451
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,480
So you can't leave me too.

452
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,450
Why would I leave you?

453
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,380
That will never happen.

454
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,610
You'll still abandon me
despite saying that.

455
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,430
Just like your dad.

456
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,860
Mom, please don't.
I'm going through a lot right now.

457
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,190
Keep loving me, Joo-in.

458
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,990
Yes. I'll always love you.

459
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,360
Even if you hate me,
I'll love you forever.

460
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,710
Oh, it's good.

You don't like loach soup, do you?

00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,760
What are you talking about?

464
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,610
I'm crazy about loach soup.

465
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,790
My nickname was even "pond loach".

466
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,100
You're a terrible liar, you know.

467
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,130
To be honest, I don't enjoy stew,
although I look like someone who would.

468
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,570
-We could go to a different place.
-Oh, no.

469
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,090
Being with you here like this is special.

470
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,570
The food doesn't matter at all.

471
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,139
It's the conversation
we have that's precious.

472
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,080
That sounds like a line
from a romantic comedy.

473
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,639
I love romantic comedies, you know.

474
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,650
I wasn't expecting that. I thought

475
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,929
you would like fish stew
and watch crime shows on TV.

476
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,200
-Did I disappoint you?
-No.

477
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,900
I'm curious to know more about you.

478
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,900
Now that's really unexpected.

479
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,680
It's good.

Mind your own business.

484
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,330
Why do you still hang my picture here?

485
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,570
You think I still have feelings for you?

486
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,640
How could you have it here
when you have no feelings for me?

487
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,370
-Because there are no more feelings.
-What?

488
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,380
To me, I just see you

489
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,270
as the character in my story.

490
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,380
I drew inspiration from it while writing.

491
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,680
That's a lie.

492
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,280
You're still living here
because you have feelings.

493
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,640
And it's also why
you didn't take this poster down.

494
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,860
I'm looking for a new place.

495
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,600
You can throw the poster out
after I move out.

496
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,700
If you leave this house this time,

497
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,100
it's really over between us.

498
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,880
It's not over yet?

499
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,910
What do I have to say to convince you?

500
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,200
You were making your own plans
to break up with me.

501
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,260
I need time to process this.

502
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,750
So don't move out yet.
Stick around longer.

503
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,770
I want you to be around
as I deal with this pain.

504
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,710
Realize what you've done.

505
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,980
Look at the consequences of your decision.

506

What are you doing there?

508
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,290
Why do you always show up at these times?

509
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,560
What's bothering you?

510
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,790
-Let's go.
-Where?

511
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,470
Anywhere.

512
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,530
I can't just leave you like this.

513
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,550
Let's go.

514
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,490
Go and rest in the guest room.

515
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,440
No, I think I'll go to a hotel.

516
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,120
That'll be uncomfortable.

517
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,260
Everyone will notice you.
You're a celebrity.

518
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,690
Stay here.

519
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,750
I'll go see my mom.

520
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,560
That'd be harder on you because
you'll have to act like you're fine.

521
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,540
Try to forget everything for a day.

522
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,950
And then try it for another day.

523
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,800
You need to get used to the idea
of Bi-soo not being around.

524
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,430
Okay.

What are you doing?

533
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,200
You can't sleep?

534
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,990
When everybody

535
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:14,750
told me not to date Bi-soo,
I scoffed at them.

536
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,240
He was such a wonderful person.

537
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,520
Now they're probably laughing at me

538
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,380
for foolishly falling in love with him.

539
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,690
You were in love,
so why would anyone laugh at you?

540
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,830
Crying when you're sad is normal.

541
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,850
You look so pretty right now.

542
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,970
Even like this?

543
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,850
You'll always look pretty to me.

544
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,610
You're pretty.

545

-Thanks, Yu-jin.
-You don't have to thank me.

546
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,280
I forbid you from thanking me.

547
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,870
I just want to say it.

548
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,740
I'm grateful so what else can I say?

549
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,890
Sure, do what pleases you.

550
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,140
You came at the right time.
Dust the store for me.

551
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,810
What's wrong?

552
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,740
I don't know what I'm doing right now.

553

If you don't know, then who does?

554
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,520
Have you ever broken up
with someone you loved?

555
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,080
Why would you break up
with the person you love?

556
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,230
You stay with the one you love
through good and bad.

557
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,880
I can't stay in a relationship

558
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,570
when I know it'll end sadly.

559
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,970
How can you be so sure that she'll be sad?

560

Who are you talking about?

561
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,730
Oh, it's a story I'm working on.

562
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,780
Let's have breakfast.

563
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,650
Sit down there.

564
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,590
Sit here, Master.

565
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,460
My place is better than staying
at a hotel, right?

566
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,940
You get breakfast prepared
by a handsome chef.

567
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,660
No hotel can provide that.

568
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,980
How do I pay the hotel bill, Chef?

569
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,600
You don't have to pay.
A smile would be enough.

570
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,700
Okay. Enjoy.

571
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,590
Thank you for this.

What?

573
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,480
You can lean on me if you need help
in getting over him.

574
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,870
Yu-jin, don't say that.

575
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,100
Well, you lean on the person you need.

576
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,230
I want to be that kind of person to you.

577
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,380
See. I'm useful like this.

578
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,750
The purpose of chemotherapy is
to remove or shrink the tumor.

579
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,820
Yet, it won't help your mom a lot
because her cancer has spread.

580
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,720
I was hoping that it would help a little.

581
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,950
Her condition hasn't improved at all?

582
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,360
I think you need to prepare yourself.

583
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,980
Let's make it
as pleasant as possible for her.

584
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,780
It's hard looking after me, isn't it?

585
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,050
You've taken care of me all this time.

Is it a cap?

587

591
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,120
What are you talking about?

592
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,940
I don't want a funeral where everyone
is weeping without me.

593
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,010
I want a happy living funeral

594
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:09,790
where all my friends are gathered
together and laughing.

595
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:16,510
I want to leave this world
with one last fond memory.

596
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,550
Could you invite Joo-in?

598
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,260

You still have something left to say?

614
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,890
I mean, you shouldn't have come here.

615
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,150
How could you show up like this?

616
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,880
-Gwang-ja.
-You asked me to be by her side.

617
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,560
But you planned to break up with her.

618
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,040
You acted as if you were in love with her.

619
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,760
Do you get a kick out of that?

620
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,410
That's enough. People are staring at us.

621
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,920
You don't have anything to say?

622
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,240
What's the point of listening to
what you have to say anyway?

623
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,630
Let's go, Gwang-ja.

624
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,370
Sir, I think you set the speed too fast.

625
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,310
I need to pick up the pace.

626
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,710
Are you back in a relationship with her?

627
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,510
Not really.

628
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,120
But she's next to me now.

Whoever stays by the girl's side
until the end wins.

631
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,670
I'm going to shower.

632
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,500
I hope you're not drinking

633

Why are you drinking?

637
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,230
I met Bi-soo today.

It went better than I thought.

640

I need to get over him.

641

You're a strong woman.

642
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,260
You're drinking alone again?

Join me if you want a drink.

00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,880
-Bring a glass.
-No, thanks.

645
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,050
What do you think about
your mom's living funeral idea?

646
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,560
It's what she wants.

647
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,410
I want to do it for her.

648
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,520
I thought you would hesitate
before you answered that.

649
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,700
You're for it?

650
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,340
I think it's a good idea.

651
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,160
I would want to have one last

652
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:49,200
good time with friends
and family before I die.

653
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,350
And apologize to the one I hurt.

654
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,150
And thank the person
who made my heart skip a beat.

655
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,740
I'd spend the entire day looking at her.

656
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,440
So that I won't forget her face
when I'm away from her.

657
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,770
I'd stare at her forever. I'd do that.

658
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,750
Seems like you're talking
about your own living funeral.

659
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,400
Let's do it.

660
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,400
Bring a glass.

661
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,850
[Han Bi-soo]

662
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,050
[Delete]

663
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,600
You look beautiful, don't you?

664
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,460
Yes, you don't see a rare beauty
like me all the time.

665
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,520
I like your confidence.

666
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,780
Would you like me to be
your plus one at the party?

667
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,140
No.

668
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,660
Hold your head high.

669
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,100
Show Bi-soo what he missed out on.

670
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,650
Send a clear message.

671
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,100
I'll be home before the clock
strikes midnight.

672
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,750
And I won't lose a glass slipper
because then he might look for me.

673
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,730
You're so clever.

674
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:36,100
Your mom can be late
because this is her living funeral.

675
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,710
But where is Joo-in?

676
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,140
She's too busy to make it.

677
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,830
No, she'll be here.

678
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,220
I talked to her on the phone.

679
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,100
Joo-in, you're pretty.

680
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,620
I'm not saying this
because you're my daughter.

681
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,970
But you're so beautiful.

682
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,160
Chang-gyu, can you let her sit there?

683
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,390
-Thank you.
-Gosh.

684
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,730
Hold still.

685
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:13,310
There you go.

686
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,870
Jae-hwan.

687
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,760
Jae-hwan.

688
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,040
I mean... Are you okay with this?

689
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,310
He broke her heart by dumping her

690
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:30,370
and then appears
at all the TV promotional shoots.

691
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,890
He keeps popping up around Joo-in.
That makes it tough on Joo-in.

692
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,000
Mr. Han is putting his whole life
on the line to make this a hit.

693
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,140
He's trying to boost the show.

694
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,660
Are you taking his side?

695
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,250
No, I'm not.

696
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,220
You can't learn anything
from a guy like him.

697
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,230
Quit being his assistant.

698
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,840
I understand what he did
to Joo-in was bad.

699
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,570
But I can't quit my job.

700
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,500
I learned a lot about writing from him.

701
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,020
If you get to know him,
you'll see his other side.

702
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,700
He's not bad at all.

703
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,890
So I got the wrong impression of him?

704
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,700
I'm disappointed in you.

705
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:10,470
Hae-jin, you went overboard
with that dress.

706
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,080
You look like a star.

707
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,770
They're pretty.

708
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,510
While wearing these shoes,
I wish you a pleasant road from now on.

709
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,790
I'll send you away the best I can.

710
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,750
You brought bottles of champagne.

711
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:30,940
-Because we're celebrating.
-For what?

712
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,690
I got an invitation to the afterworld.

713
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,810
Other people don't have time
to prepare when they pass.

714
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,250
So I'm very lucky.

715
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,740
I only invited my cherished friends

716
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,680
to this living funeral.

717
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,580
So you're all lucky people.

718
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,220
Jung-hwa, don't cry.

719
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,320
If you cry, you have to pay a fine.

720
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,470
Every tear will get you fined
a million won.

721
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,440
I can't dare to shed a tear.

722
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,960
I wasn't crying. I was just yawning.

723
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,100
Let's raise our glasses.

724
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,770
To Kang Hae-jin's next wonderful trip!

725
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,540
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

726
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,340
Thank you.

727
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,870
That looks identical to Hae-jin's ring.

728
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,550
I gave it to her.

729
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,050
-Doesn't it look nice?
-Yes, it does.

730
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,690
Man, you're acting so shy.

731
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,370
They make a cute couple.

732
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,880
I want to take a picture.

733
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,560
They're so cute.

734
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:48,430
Hae-jin, if you could be reborn,
what would you want to be reborn as?

735
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,450
That's a sudden question.

736
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,410
As Bi-soo's daughter.

737
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,090
Why?

738
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,910
So that you can get back at me
for being a naughty kid?

739
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,160
Joo-in, what would you want to be
reborn as?

740
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,630
I'd like to be reborn as Bi-soo.

741
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,950
Why would you choose to be him?

742
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,650
I thought I knew everything about him,

743
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,620
but there's a lot I still don't know.

744
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,130
I'm curious to know what
goes on in his head.

745
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,410
Bi-soo has found his match.

746
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,760
I'd like to know what you're thinking
right now. How about telling me?

747
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,290
I think they want to be alone
with each other.

748
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,900
Come on. Hurry.

749
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,380
-Let's drink champagne.
-Yes, let's drink.

750
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,290
-Chang-gyu.
-Come on. Let's drink.

751
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,480
I don’t think I can keep this ring.

752
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,280
Your mom gave this to me

753
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,420
because she wanted me to be by your side.

754
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,030
And I'd like to keep that promise.

755
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,420
I'll let go of you

756
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,900
as you wish.

757
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,050
It's over now.

758
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:13,880
[Oh! Master]
