00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,940
Hello, author.

2
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,270
My name is Kim Do-ja.

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,020
I read the final chapter released

4
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,110
today with great interest.

5
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,360
Three Ways of Survival in a Perishing World,

6
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,640
Three Ways of Survival in a Perishing World – Completed.

7
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,940
You who have read this story will survive.

8
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,940
Final Chapter

9
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,090
abbreviated as Ways of Survival, began serialization

10
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,710
when I was in my third year of middle school.

11
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,180
We need people and money.

12
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,340
I still vividly remember its first sentence:

13
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,050
The subway came to a stop

14
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,120
The subway came to a stop in the middle of Dongho Bridge.
The subway jolted violently, followed by a metallic groan,
And the noise of a panicked crowd was heard.

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,120
in the middle of Dongho Bridge.

16
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,290
The free service of Line 8612 has ended.

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,690
The gods, to punish fallen humanity,

18
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,640
brought upon them unbearable suffering.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,860
As the world gradually descended into ruin,

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,440
the protagonist Yoo Jeong-hyuk

21
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,290
and his pals overcame hardships together.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,260
In its early days,
Ways of Survival was quite popular,

23
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,240
but as the story progressed,

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,390
Chapter List | View Count
Three Ways of Survival in a Perishing World

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,020
it was criticized for its exaggerated settings

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,160
and unrealistic plot, and its popularity waned.

27
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,160
What are you doing?

28
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,560
Let me see. Let me see.

29
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,030
-Let me see. Let me see.
-Give it to me!

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,940
Damn! You wanna die?

31
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,240
Nevertheless, this was the only novel

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,110
I read throughout my student years.

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,770
Every time a new chapter was uploaded,

34
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,680
I worried I wouldn't be able to
connect with the story,

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,220
so I would restart from the first two episodes.

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,410
On weekends, I would reread
all the serialized chapters.

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,210
Yes, from the moment
the view counter showed only 1,

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,870
I was the only one reading.

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,210
Why did I keep reading a novel
that no one else looked at for ten years?

40
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,620
Because I envied Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

41
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,360
Geumho
Yaksu Oksu

42
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,920
Yoo Jeong-hyuk and his pals

43
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,410
swiftly and mercilessly defeated their enemies,

44
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,400
Chungmuro

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,590
never flinching even in battles

46
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,590
against monsters.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,800
Lee Hyun-seong!

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,060
But after he began losing his pals,

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,980
Yoo Jeong-hyuk resolved to

50
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,270
become stronger in order to survive.

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,630
And so, he grew increasingly powerful,

52
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,250
but I remained exactly the same
after entering the high school.

53
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,170
From now on, you'll fight on your own.

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,470
Whoever loses stays with us forever.

55
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,400
Whoever wins is free from today onwards.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,190
Kim Do-ja / Ahn Min-seop

57
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,240
What?

58
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,040
Feeling troubled at the thought of
being the only one to survive?

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,230
Hey, alright.

60
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,720
Don't do it if you don't want to.

61
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,110
But I made it clear what happens if you win.

62
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,840
Back then, I remember thinking

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,100
How I wished I could become
strong like Yoo Jeong-hyuk!

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,380
I truly had such thoughts.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,220
Graduated from a middling university,

66
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,360
drifted through mediocre jobs,

67
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,030
and later joined this company

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,720
as a contract worker.

69
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,360
Today, as the novel's serialization ends,

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,330
also marks my last day at work.

71
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,980
Do-ja, take care!

72
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,530
Come find me if you're ever in the area.

73
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,330
I'll treat you to a meal.

74
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,410
Okay.

75
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,800
Kim Do-ja
Jinoh Soft

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,970
Author, I genuinely appreciate your hard work.

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,370
But why

78
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,910
must Yoo Jeong-hyuk be the sole survivor?

79
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,610
An ending

80
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,900
where everyone perishes and only he remains,

81
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,700
what are you trying to convey?

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,690
Yoo Jeong-hyuk once claimed,

83
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,980
'Some sacrifices are

84
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,390
unavoidable for my survival'.

85
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,300
Is that the message of this story?

86
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,670
I cannot accept it.

87
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,840
This is,

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,530
without a doubt, the most terrible novel.

89
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,580
'Some sacrifices are unavoidable for my survival'.
Is that the message of this story?
I cannot accept it.
This is, without a doubt, the most terrible novel.

90
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,080
The train is arriving.

91
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,940
Gosh, it feels like the ground
is going to collapse.

92
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,310
Hey, Sang-ah.

93
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,390
You've really worked hard.

94
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,490
I never expected to become
a permanent employee anyway.

95
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,130
No point in testing the waters
when it's someone else's position.

96
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,240
I need to pull myself together quickly
and find a job that suits me.

97
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,120
Thank you.

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,050
Did you find another job that fast?

99
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,510
I'm on my way to a part-time job.

100
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,200
I need to get through this month first.

101
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,830
But you know how
I designed the character outfits?

102
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,020
I tried it and felt it really suits me,

103
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,450
so I want to try working with real clothes.

104
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,940
Eventually, I want to launch my
own brand and open a store.

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,700
Not bad, right?

106
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,750
That's impressive, Sang-ah.

107
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,720
Hey, Sang-ah!

108
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,900
Fancy meeting you here.

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,740
Hello, Manager.

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,990
I told you to have a meal before leaving.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,830
Why did you just leave?

112
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,230
I have some things to take care of.

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,970
Ah, I'm so sad that you're leaving.
What should I do?

114
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,700
If you'd given me some opportunity,

115
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,250
I might have been able to secure
a permanent position for you.

116
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,020
No, this is because I'm not capable enough.

117
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,050
Let's not talk here.

118
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,460
Let's go out and have a meal together.

119
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,030
I know a good restaurant in Apgujeong.

120
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,180
I need to go to my part-time job.

121
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,360
Ah, don't refuse.

122
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,880
Okay, I'll pay you your part-time wages.

123
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,870
Really, it's fine.

124
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,980
I work with a group.

125
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,090
Oh, friends?

126
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,670
Hello, Manager.

127
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,050
I'm Kim Do-ja from
the Map Development Team.

128
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,750
Oh,

129
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,700
so this is how you two always
interacted at the company?

130
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,940
Ah, what a pity.

131
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,950
This station is Apgujeong.
Apgujeong Station.

132
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,570
Enjoy your meal.

133
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,730
Alright, Sang-ah.

134
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,290
Alright, Sang-ah. Let's meet
again when we have time.

135
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,250
That lunatic, really...

136
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,530
I was so afraid of getting fired
that I couldn't even report him.

137
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,540
It's so frustrating.

138
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,420
You did the right thing.

139
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
The one who endures wins.

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,720
How can the one
who endures be the winner?

141
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,000
That's just foolish.

142
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,910
But what's truly maddening is knowing

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,890
everything yet being unable to speak out.

144
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,770
it makes you feel like an idiot.

145
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,490
You know what I mean, right?

146
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Reader, I am the author of Ways of Survival.

147
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,280
Thank you for reading my novel all this time.

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,540
Please excuse me.

149
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,330
Are you really the author?

150
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,330
The story came out because of you.

151
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,600
Doors closing.

152
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,470
No, Author. You've truly worked hard.
I think I wrote some inappropriate things in the email.

153
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,990
Girlfriend?

154
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,560
No.

155
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,940
So we'll publish reader's submission as the afterwords.
If you didn't like the ending, you can write one yourself.

156
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,190
The service will go live at 7 PM.

157
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,320
Please show

158
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,490
us the ending

159
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,450
you want to see.

160
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,910
tls123 ended the chat.

161
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,790
The ending I want...?

162
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,310
What does this mean?

163
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,620
What's wrong?

164
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,610
Thank you?

165
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,740
Reader's Submission at 7?

166
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,080
There is only one reader anymore.

167
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
Does that mean I can change the ending?

168
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,650
Are you okay?

169
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,090
The free service of Line 8612 has ended.

170
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,060
Paid service will begin now.

171
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,550
Let me rephrase.

172
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,420
The free service of
the 8612 Planetary System has ended.

173
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,500
Tuesday, April 1st, 7 PM.

174
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,110
Paid service will begin now.

175
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,480
This can't be...?

176
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,090
A broadcast notification echoed across the sky.
The free service of the 8612 Planetary System has ended.
Paid service will begin now.

177
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,900
A broadcast notification echoed across the sky.

178
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,310
The free service of
the 8612 Planetary System has ended.

179
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,320
Paid service will begin now.

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Too bizarre to be an elemental,
too evil to be an angel,
too innocent-looking to be a demon.
This creature was a Goblin.
The goblin uttered something incomprehensible.

181
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,570
What? Goblin?

182
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,410
Things are already chaotic enough,
what the hell is this?

183
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,830
-What's going on?
-Who's doing this?

184
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,910
This was exactly like
the very first line of that novel.

185
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,680
Hey.

186
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,490
Seems the Korean translation
is finally synced.

187
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,250
Everyone, can you hear me now?

188
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,690
-What's going on?
-What is this?

189
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,830
Okay, okay, understood.

190
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,500
I know you're all busy, but I need
a moment of your time. Thank you.

191
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,220
Just start the train!

192
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,300
How could this be happening?

193
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,890
Now, now, quiet everyone.

194
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,630
First, listen carefully to
what I say from this moment on.

195
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,600
Because I'm about to tell you
the most important thing.

196
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,530
I said start the train now!

197
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,970
Unless you want me to
smash this place to pieces?

198
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,240
Everyone's already swamped,
and you just stop the train for no reason?

199
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,590
SILENCE!

200
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,240
Everyone,

201
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,900
listen closely to every single word
I say from now on.

202
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,930
The noble gods, high above
and unseeable to human eyes,

203
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,570
have deliberated and reached a conclusion:

204
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,210
to punish all of humanity, the most despicably

205
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,600
selfish race in the entire universe,

206
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,240
concerned only with filling their own desires.

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,580
Channel 8613 is now open.

208
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,910
The Constellations will begin entering shortly.

209
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,930
Pleased to meet you, Constellations.

210
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,200
Many interesting things are about to happen.

211
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,970
Please enjoy the show.

212
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,160
Now then, from this moment on,

213
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,700
all humans will encounter Scenarios.

214
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,310
Your fate will be determined

215
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,420
by how you resolve them.

216
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,870
The first main scenario will now begin.

217
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:38,470
Main Scenario #1: Proof of Value
Clear Condition: Kill one or more beings.
Category: Main
Reward: 300 Coins
Difficulty: F
Failure: Death
Time Limit: 10 minutes

218
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,620
Since it's everyone's first time,

219
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,310
I'll explain it kindly.

220
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,020
Kill one or more lives

221
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,520
in this subway.

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,610
Succeed within 10 minutes,

223
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,960
and each of you gets 300 Coins.

224
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,100
Fail and you end up like this.

225
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,270
Simple, right?

226
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,720
Our Constellations are watching from above.

227
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,680
From now on, forget things like laws and ethics.

228
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,410
Feel free to show everyone

229
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,710
the true nature of humanity.

230
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,260
Do-ja, calls aren't getting through, right?

231
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,510
Right. They probably won't.

232
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,190
When did you get on?

233
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,400
Where are your parents?

234
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,650
Mister, are you gonna kill me?

235
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,110
Yoo Jeong-hyuk?

236
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,480
Get a grip.

237
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,240
The novel that only I know
has become reality.

238
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,910
Doesn't that mean
I know what happens next?

239
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,490
Wait...

240
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,620
then that means...

241
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,140
First, I need to clear the scenario.

242
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,480
Think.

243
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,270
One or more beings!

244
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,110
Main Scenario #1: Proof of Value
Clear Condition: Kill one or more beings.
Category: Main
Reward: 300 Coins
Difficulty: F
Failure: Death
Time Limit: 10 minutes

245
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,960
Sang-ah,

246
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,370
here,

247
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,210
take this.

248
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,710
I'll help others.

249
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,500
Where are you going?

250
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,300
Are you insane?

251
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,670
No, you'll die if you go!

252
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,430
I know about this.

253
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,180
What?

254
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,260
I know how to solve this.

255
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,440
Wait, everyone, wait!

256
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,490
Listen to me!

257
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,240
Hold on!

258
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,550
System Announcement
The first 'kill' has been generated in the current area.
300 coins have been paid to the killer.

259
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,630
The first 'kill' has been
generated in the current area.

260
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,590
300 coins have been paid to the killer.

261
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,350
What?

262
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,180
Mister,

263
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,640
how did you know how to do that?

264
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,260
Yeah, answer us!

265
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,140
Everyone, look at the tooltip.

266
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,810
To be precise, it says each person
must kill 'one or more beings'.

267
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,100
But

268
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,520
it says 'beings',

269
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,530
not 'human beings'.

270
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,030
Wait!

271
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,400
Wait! Don't come any closer now,

272
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,160
or I'll kill then all!

273
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,450
Wait, wait!

274
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,080
Then how many are left?
Tell us that first!

275
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,080
Well...

276
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,380
there probably aren't enough for everyone.

277
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,920
Mister,

278
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,170
if there aren't enough, you should
have said so from the start!

279
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,220
Why did you kill one
without saying anything?

280
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,550
Then how do we decide?

281
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,010
Shouldn't we give priority to the children?

282
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,590
What are you talking about?

283
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,310
That's not fair! All human lives are equal!

284
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,180
-Is only your child's life precious?
-Calm down!

285
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,480
While I also wish there
were enough for everyone...

286
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,940
So what do we do?

287
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,940
We're running out of time!

288
00:15:59,230 --> 00:15:59,980
Decide quickly!

289
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,650
Wait! Wait a second!

290
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,480
That..

291
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm his superior.

292
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,320
Wait.

293
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,320
Honey,

294
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,830
why are you trying to make the decision?

295
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,370
This is a job for someone
with more life experience.

296
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,450
So, hand it over to me.

297
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,450
Manager.

298
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,000
There are too

299
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,870
many people now.

300
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,960
That's exactly why I will handle this.

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Give it to me first.

302
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,970
Don't push!

303
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,470
Alright, alright.

304
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,680
Why are you still alive?

305
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,490
Are you out of your mind?

306
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,950
You wanna die?

307
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,570
Here.

308
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,490
Both you and the old lady will survive.

309
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,740
I have a bug too!

310
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:56,910
Right here!

311
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,790
A real bug who doesn't know anything!

312
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,290
So this is what Kim Num-hun,
who was in Yoo Jeong-hyuk's party

313
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,630
early in the novel, was really like?

314
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,500
Hey!

315
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,500
Damn!

316
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,380
If that's the case,
then why don't you just die?!

317
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,220
Wait!

318
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,930
Right.

319
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
If this is exactly like the novel...

320
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,150
Invest 300 coins in Muscle Power.

321
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,940
Invest 300 coins in Muscle Power.

322
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,530
Strength
Muscle Power
Agility

323
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,900
Muscle Power improved.

324
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,580
You bastard...

325
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,170
you're dead.

326
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,290
Kim Num-hun uses
the skill Dark Transformation.

327
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,960
Kim Num-hun was the first one
to get sponsorships.

328
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,800
Of all people, I had to run into this guy.

329
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,020
Whoa, this is...

330
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,570
I can even use skills. This is so fun!

331
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,980
Mister, you want to save
the old woman, right?

332
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,820
Then you die instead.

333
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,460
Do ant eggs

334
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,750
count as beings too?

335
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,260
You have killed a being and received 300 coins.

336
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:33,050
You have killed a being and received 300 coins.

337
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,680
Invest 3000 coins in Strength,

338
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,390
and another 3000 coins in Agility.

339
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,580
Mister,

340
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,290
I get it.

341
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,960
I'll leave that old woman alone.

342
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,000
Give me the ants.

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I've changed my mind.

344
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,920
You have no place in this story.

345
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,710
What the hell are
you talking about? Damn it!

346
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,510
Hey, get out of the way! Damn it!

347
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,140
Move!

348
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,140
Move!

349
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,140
Hurry! Damn it!

350
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,770
Damn!

351
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,520
Damn it, I said MOVE!

352
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,110
Time's up.

353
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,120
The scenario has ended.

354
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,970
Grandma.

355
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,800
Wake up!

356
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,260
Grandma.

357
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,560
Do-ja.

358
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,860
Are you okay?

359
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,540
Ta-da!

360
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,800
Congratulations to the 18 humans

361
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,090
who cleared the first scenario!

362
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,170
The original intent was to
have you kill each other,

363
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,800
but fine, using ants
isn't against the rules either.

364
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,100
Thanks to that, the Constellations find this carriage
more entertaining than the others,

365
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,640
so we'll let it slide for now.

366
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,600
Now,

367
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,560
it's time for

368
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,230
the Constellation Sponsor Selection!

369
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,530
Having a Constellation's support
is very reassuring, isn't it?

370
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,740
Making a choice

371
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,070
will greatly assist you in clearing future scenarios.

372
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,450
Be active

373
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,160
System Announcement
Be active and and the following constellations
might be your sponsor.
A sponsor will provide
significant aid to your adventure.
Please choose your desired sponsor.
Black Flame Dragon from the Abyss
Arbiter of Evil Fire
Secretive Plotter
Prisoner of the Orphan

374
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,290
and the following constellations
might be your sponsor.

375
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,540
What's this?

376
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,370
A Constellation Sponsor?

377
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,290
Constellations?

378
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,420
Constellations

379
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,550
are beings watching these scenarios

380
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,840
from somewhere beyond Earth.

381
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,050
They mock and enjoy the sight of humans

382
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,310
System Announcement
Be active and and the following constellations
might be your sponsor.
A sponsor will provide
significant aid to your adventure.
Please choose your desired sponsor.
Black Flame Dragon from the Abyss
Arbiter of Evil Fire
Secretive Plotter
Prisoner of the Orphan

383
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,640
struggling for survival.

384
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,350
Once you choose a Constellation
and it becomes your sponsor,

385
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,760
you can receive help.

386
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,640
but a day will come

387
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,100
-Crouching Dragon
-Bear That Pretended to Be Dead To Live Again
-Make no choice

388
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,100
when you must pay the price.

389
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
Hurry and come over here.

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,670
Hurry!

391
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,560
Lee Hyun-seong,

392
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,320
another character who was

393
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,650
once with Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

394
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,490
Don't just use brute strength.

395
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,530
Use a skill.

396
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,450
Skill?

397
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
How do I do that?

398
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,950
There's a skill window

399
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,450
at the bottom right of your vision.

400
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,830
Just focus on it.

401
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,520
Lee Hyun-seong uses
Stage One of Push the Mountain.

402
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,980
Out of the way.

403
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,790
Cross the bridge once you're out there.

404
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,750
Hurry!

405
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
My name is Lee Hyun-seong.

406
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,670
My name is Kim Do-ja.

407
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,920
Let's get outside.

408
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,600
Hey, what are you doing?

409
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,650
Hurry and get out! We've got to go.

410
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,740
We have to go. Let's go.

411
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
Don't cry.

412
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,620
Don't cry.

413
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,540
It will only make you tired.

414
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,040
What's your name?

415
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,290
Lee Gil-yeong

416
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,750
Gil-yeong, can you run?

417
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:08,470
But because of you,
the entire ant nest collapsed!

418
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,930
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,640
-But we need to hurry now... - No way!

420
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,810
How can you just say sorry?

421
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,150
You need to take responsibility!

422
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,680
You've arrived at a sub-scenario.

423
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,720
Cross the collapsed bridge.

424
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,100
Sub-scenario: Escape
Clear Condition: Cross the collapsed bridge
Category: Sub
Reward: 1,000 Coins
Difficulty: C
Failure: No penalty
Time Limit: None

425
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,350
The collapsed bridge?
It looks perfectly fine.

426
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,640
Because it's about to collapse.

427
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,130
It's just getting started.
Don't just stand there!

428
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,420
Fine, let's crank up the difficulty.

429
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,320
Do-ja.

430
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
I just thought about this.

431
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,910
I really only just imagined it,

432
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,370
but the bridge is actually doing it!

433
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm going ahead!

434
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,790
Hyun-seong!

435
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,710
Sang-ah!

436
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,630
Did you select
a Constellation Sponsor earlier?

437
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,680
The sponsor must be helping.

438
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
Let's hurry!

439
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,020
The poison cloud will explode soon.

440
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,140
We need to get underground quickly to hide.

441
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,400
And we must collect coins.

442
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,690
-We can use them to trade.
-How do we get them?

443
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,280
We need to configure things first.

444
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,820
First, quickly take shelter
in the nearest building.

445
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,360
If we follow the route Yoo Jeong-hyuk took,
we should be safe.

446
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,950
Wait,

447
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,160
but in the novel,

448
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,000
at Chungmuro Station,

449
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,540
Yoo Jeong-hyuk fought
the Fire Dragon alone and died.

450
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,050
Although he used the Regression skill

451
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,010
to return to the story's beginning,

452
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,180
in a world without the protagonist,

453
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,510
Everyone disappeared.

454
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,930
The protagonist absolutely cannot die.

455
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,060
But

456
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,900
with the strategy I know

457
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,150
I can't capture the Fire Dragon alone.

458
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,410
Ah, damn it!

459
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,560
If I tell Yoo Jeong-hyuk the strategy

460
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,900
and we fight together...

461
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,490
Do-ja, hurry!

462
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,490
Wait! I'm coming!

463
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,240
Hey, Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

464
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,550
Who are you?

465
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,930
What?

466
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,350
It's just...

467
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,220
Kim Num-hun wasn't
supposed to die so early.

468
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,640
Did you do this?

469
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,940
No, that wasn't me.

470
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,650
Yoo Jeong-hyuk uses False Insight.

471
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,240
What the hell!

472
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,200
You know how to use coins?

473
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,870
-It's not what you think. -Do-ja!

474
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,290
Are you okay?

475
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,870
I'm fine. Don't come closer.

476
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,210
Really, I'm okay, stay back!

477
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,340
And you know Lee Hyun-seong.

478
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,220
-I'm meeting him for the first time today...
-I'll ask you one more time.

479
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,720
Who are you?

480
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,970
Even if I said this is the world
of a novel I read,

481
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,520
he definitely wouldn't believe me.

482
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,100
My name is Kim Do-ja.

483
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,480
In a few days, you will die fighting
the Fire Dragon at Chungmuro Station.

484
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,610
Even if you use your Regression skill,
it will take a long time to clear that scenario.

485
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,370
But if you work with me,
we can capture the Fire Dragon this time.

486
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,490
I know the strategy.

487
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,830
Yoo Jeong-hyuk uses False Insight.

488
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,750
How do you know the strategy?

489
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,550
My exclusive skill is Prophecy.

490
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,600
So if you work with me,

491
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,640
future scenarios won't be a problem.

492
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,970
Let's cross the bridge first.

493
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,640
You're going to Geumho, right?

494
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,350
Hey, Kim Do-ja.

495
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,100
What?

496
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,650
What? What are you doing?

497
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,900
Tell me

498
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,110
the strategy you mentioned.

499
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,700
We can do it together.

500
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,320
I hate working with others.

501
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,240
If I tell you the strategy,
you'll let go, won't you?

502
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,950
You'll fall anyway if you don't talk.

503
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,330
Wait! Wait!

504
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,460
Yoo Jeong-hyuk!
I'm really afraid of height!

505
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,880
I really can't do this!

506
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,170
Don't let go yet!

507
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,760
One last question.

508
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,510
Why did the world become like this?

509
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,640
Why must humanity be punished like this?

510
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,190
No, how should I know that?!

511
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,530
Make it to Chungmuro alive.

512
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,030
You'll find out then.

513
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,410
I'll decide whether
to fight with you later.

514
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,130
Yoo Jeong-hyuk! You bastard!

515
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,300
In a few days, Yoo Jeong-hyuk
would die fighting the Fire Dragon.

516
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,220
But for me to survive,

517
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,470
the protagonist absolutely cannot die.

518
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,640
But before that,

519
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,060
I'm going to die.

520
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,920
You have arrived at a hidden scenario!

521
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,840
Please kill the Ichthyosaur
and escape from its stomach.

522
00:31:46,010 --> 00:32:04,940
Hidden Scenario: Command Destroyer
Clear Condition: Kill the commanding Ichthyosaur and escape.
Category: Hidden
Reward: 9,000 Coins
Difficulty: A
Failure: Death
Time Limit: 48 hours

523
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,600
I have to kill it to get out?

524
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,690
Damn it!

525
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,770
I don't have any items.

526
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Alive? Alive.

527
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,780
Constellations,

528
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,780
as you can see, a human has
just entered the Ichthyosaur's stomach.

529
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,040
That's right. Siding with the Goblin

530
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,500
makes it easier to purchase items.

531
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,130
What Goblin love the most is...

532
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,750
-Right? Right? Constellations? -Hey!

533
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,630
You. Come here.

534
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,220
He's talking to me now.
Let's get a little closer.

535
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,090
This cowardly human.

536
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,600
Serves you right for trying to
save people with your ant nest earlier.

537
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,970
You were really scary before,

538
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,730
shooting lasers everywhere wildly.

539
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,480
Hey, friend, please don't use
informal speech with me.

540
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,360
I will keep using informal speech.

541
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,320
If you don't like it, why don't you
try laser-beaming me to death?

542
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,910
You fake human, how dare you
speak to a Goblin like that!

543
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,820
Pil.

544
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,620
You're running a Star Stream
right now, aren't you?

545
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,040
What?

546
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,210
How did you know my name?

547
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,500
And Star Stream?

548
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,250
Your channel must be pretty
lively right now, right?

549
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,000
There are survivors like me there.

550
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,590
The Constellations must be very curious about
what happens to me next.

551
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,550
If you kill me now, what can you do next?

552
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,470
No, how do you know all this?

553
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,230
Turn off your stream for a minute. Let's talk.

554
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,650
Constellations, I need to turn off
the channel for a bit!

555
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,820
Now speak.

556
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,330
How does a mere mortal
know about Star streaming?

557
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,000
My stomach hurts.

558
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,210
That's not the point.

559
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,500
No, you told me to turn it off!

560
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,920
Pil.

561
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,130
Think about it.

562
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,170
Do you really want to spend your whole life
as a low-grade Goblin, living job to job?

563
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,890
What do you mean?

564
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,760
What do Goblins do?

565
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,310
The Constellations enter your channels,

566
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,480
and you tell them interesting
human stories, show them things, right?

567
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,650
And if you receive a lot of sponsorships,
you become the top Goblin.

568
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,980
I can guarantee

569
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,940
the story I'm about to create
will be incredibly exciting.

570
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,450
If you sign a long-term contract
with me for your channel,

571
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,030
you'll become the King of Goblin.

572
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,080
Say something believable.

573
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,170
You're about to die here,
and you're talking about a long-term contract?

574
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,710
Why do you think the Constellations
watch Star streams?

575
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,630
Because they find it entertaining
to watch humans struggle.

576
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,430
That's why they watch while
giving sponsorships, right?

577
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:36,890
Correct.

578
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,060
Then, suppose we sign a long-term contract.

579
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,730
I cleared the scenario on the subway.

580
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,850
I fought Kim Num-hun using skills.

581
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,860
I got eaten by an Ichthyosaur.

582
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,900
But I survive and escape.

583
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,280
And after getting out,
I keep clearing scenarios.

584
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,450
How many sponsorships do you
think our channel would get then?

585
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,450
How can I believe things
will unfold like that?

586
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,330
Look how many sponsorships
your channel has received already.

587
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,340
Hey, let's see. Ones, tens,
hundreds, thousands.

588
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,210
Wow, this is insane. What's happening?

589
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,590
Fine,

590
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,760
let's sign a contract.

591
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,430
Business contract.

592
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,340
50/50 profit split. How about it?

593
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,780
And so it begins.

594
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,490
Constellations! The story from inside
the Ichthyosaur's stomach is now beginning!

595
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,740
How will he escape this crisis?

596
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,120
Open the Goblin Bag for a moment.

597
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,750
The Goblin Bag?

598
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,670
No, how do you know about that too?

599
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:52,880
Goblin Bag
Coin Shop
Welcome to the 'Goblin Bag'.
You may purchase and sell desired items.

600
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,850
Stone Hog's Thorn
Grade E
Price: 100 C

601
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,680
Oh ho! He's purchasing an item!

602
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,350
Let's see how he uses it!

603
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,570
Yoo Jeong-hyuk was once trapped in
an Ichthyosaur's stomach.

604
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,080
If you block all the gastric acid
spray holes with thorns,

605
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,830
the Ichthyosaur will die.

606
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,250
But the problem is,

607
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,710
how long will this take?

608
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,550
In a few days,

609
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Yoo Jeong-hyuk will die fighting
the Fire Dragon at Chungmuro Station.

610
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,730
Even if you use your Regression skill,
it will take a long time to clear that scenario.

611
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,650
But if you work with me,

612
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,230
we can capture the Fire Dragon this time.

613
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,500
This scenario is all about endurance.

614
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,300
This is the final stretch.

615
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:38,660
System Announcement
You have cleared the hidden scenario!
You've received 9000 coins as the reward!

616
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,570
You have cleared the hidden scenario!

617
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,570
You've received 9000 coins as the reward!

618
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,990
No, what is this?

619
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,410
Mr. Do-ja,

620
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,620
you really defeated the Ichthyosaur?

621
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,290
Move aside.

622
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,470
Oh! That's the Ichthyosaur's core!

623
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,850
How did you know it was there?

624
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,940
Put this in the Goblin Bag.

625
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,690
Not for selling,

626
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,610
but a one-on-one exchange.

627
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,980
The desired item is the Ether of Faith.

628
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,900
If anyone wants to trade,

629
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,070
notify me via the system announcement.

630
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,950
Wow, Mr. Do-ja.

631
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,990
To be honest, I'm a little scared now.

632
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,410
Forget defeating the Ichthyosaur,

633
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,870
Goblin Bag
Coin Shop
Welcome to the 'Goblin Bag'.
You may purchase and sell desired items.

634
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,120
but you found its core,
whose location was unknown,

635
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,420
Listed Item: Ichthyosaur's Core
Rarity: SSS

636
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,420
Desired Item: Faith Ether
Rarity: SSS

637
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,290
and now you're asking to
trade it for Ether of Faith.

638
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,420
Exchange Item

639
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,540
The Ether of Faith.

640
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,880
It's so hard to get.

641
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,800
It's impossible to have that
in the early scenarios!

642
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,840
Then start looking for it quickly.

643
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,550
Come immediately when I call you.

644
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,550
And open the Goblin Bag occasionally,

645
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,430
okay?

646
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,430
I'll do my best, Mr. Do-ja!

647
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,850
Ah, also, I don't have much to give you,

648
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,850
but take this as
a contract commemorative gift.

649
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,650
It should be useful after you get out.

650
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,990
Starter Pack.

651
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,730
Oh, Starter Pack.

652
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,320
Not bad.

653
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:27,520
Will you accept the constellation
'Black Moon Hunter' as your sponsor?
YES
NO

654
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,090
Will you accept the constellation
'Black Moon Hunter' as your sponsor?

655
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,390
Will you accept the constellation
'Black Moon Hunter' as your sponsor?

656
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,980
Constellations,

657
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,350
you find this really amusing, don't you?

658
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,750
Will you accept the constellation
'Black Moon Hunter' as your sponsor?
YES
NO

659
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,700
Hey, Pil.

660
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,410
Turn off the sponsor-related system windows.

661
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,250
Okay.

662
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,410
But where are you going now?

663
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,290
Geumho Station.

664
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,630
There's someone I have to meet.

665
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,920
Is it to see that tall guy?

666
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,210
Don't go.

667
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,840
That guy has plenty of items
and a high level.

668
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,590
We just signed a contract!

669
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,800
What will I do if you die?

670
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,680
Ah, so hungry.

671
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,990
Hey!

672
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,660
Hey!

673
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,840
Can you hear me?

674
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,050
Snap out of it!

675
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,970
Can you stand up?

676
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,060
Can you hear me?

677
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,150
Hey!

678
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,860
Geumho

679
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,320
Don't!

680
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,490
Geumho

681
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,890
Hey!

682
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,190
Can you hear me?

683
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,150
-Over there. -What?

684
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,810
So it's true.

685
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,570
Jeong Hee-won.

686
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,860
You're alive.

687
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,570
Jeong Hee-won?

688
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,240
I thought you went off and
died with the scouting team!

689
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,620
Just you wait.

690
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,240
Ugh, mister.

691
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,250
Why did you bring back someone

692
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,790
we already dealt with?

693
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,840
So annoying.

694
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,460
In Ways of Survival,
the Geumho Station chapter

695
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,010
was especially boring

696
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,680
because the characters
were all so predictable.

697
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,140
You're Bang Cheol-soo, right?

698
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,470
What?

699
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:12,970
You know me?

700
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:14,930
What are you doing?

701
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,180
Bring it on.

702
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,650
Invest 1500 coins in Muscle Power.

703
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,020
Invest 1500 coins in Muscle Power.

704
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,280
What's his deal?

705
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,160
He's using a skill!

706
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,780
You should've said so earlier.

707
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,620
Bang Cheol-soo receives the blessing of
his sponsor, the Miscellaneous Sovereign.

708
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,120
How could you pick such a lousy sponsor?

709
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,460
Left, chest, right.

710
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,420
Seriously, this guy is so predictable.

711
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,470
Boss.

712
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,640
Kill him!

713
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,180
Go!

714
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,890
Bang Cheol-soo!

715
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,110
What are you doing?!

716
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,440
Okay, let's go!

717
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,290
Wait.

718
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,790
Who's this guy?

719
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,260
Do-ja!

720
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,680
It's thanks to that congressman-like guy

721
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,650
we've survived this long.

722
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,230
He convinced the high-level
people to go hunting

723
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,490
and share with everyone.

724
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,320
There.

725
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,820
This should heal quickly with the treatment.

726
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,870
Hey, Lee Gil-yeong.

727
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,950
I told you to stop that.

728
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,160
Why? They're all my friends.

729
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,910
This kid started acting
a bit strange since then.

730
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,540
Talking to bugs,

731
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,630
just sitting there with
his hands on his head.

732
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,670
No, I think it's fine.

733
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,880
But, Do-ja,

734
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,930
why did that guy on the bridge

735
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,140
push you off back then?

736
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,060
What?

737
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,310
Ah, him.

738
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,690
We've known each other
since we were kids.

739
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,150
He's always had a bit of
a extreme personality.

740
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,150
He caused some trouble
here too before he left.

741
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,280
No, he never came here.

742
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:33,860
He didn't?

743
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,120
When we crossed the bridge,

744
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,410
as the poison gas was spreading,
he bravely went towards Namsan alone.

745
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,250
Yoo Jeong-hyuk never came to Geumho Station?

746
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,870
That's impossible.

747
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,330
Wait,

748
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,670
does that mean the Geumho Station
scenario hasn't been cleared yet?

749
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,760
Yesterday, a few people said they
would clear it and enter the tunnel.

750
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,880
but none of them came back.

751
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,180
Crap.

752
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,970
Without clearing the scenario,
I can't advance to Chungmuro Station.

753
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,890
But why is this different from my memories?

754
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,810
Alright, residents.

755
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,320
There are three hours left
until the survival tax is due.

756
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,940
The scouting team will
depart in five minutes.

757
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,490
Please get ready.

758
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,740
The elderly and frail,
please remain here if possible.

759
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,580
Able-bodied men who feel capable...
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.ovh to support Admin)

760
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,950
The Geumho Station scenario

761
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,080
imposes a daily survival tax of 100 coins

762
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,830
per person until all monsters

763
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,210
are eliminated.

764
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,960
Residents desperate for coins

765
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,170
risk dangerous hunts,

766
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,970
Geumho

767
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,220
while those who fail to pay

768
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,140
die

769
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,720
on the spot.

770
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,600
Mister.

771
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,350
New guy.

772
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,020
Hey,

773
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,900
we heard you took all
the coins for yourself. Is that true?

774
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,320
What?

775
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,700
You've been hunting monsters
in this area for coins, right?

776
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,160
Then you should share them with everyone.

777
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,830
What kind of nonsense is this,
trying to keep it all to yourself?

778
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,540
Hand everything over to the Congressman

779
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,960
for fair distribution.

780
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,460
Did you think you were the only
one having a hard time?

781
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,630
Yeah, exactly!

782
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,050
I think you have the wrong idea.

783
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,880
I haven't been hunting.

784
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,420
What do you mean you haven't?

785
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,840
Isn't the reason
you're so good at fighting

786
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,890
because you got coins from hunting?

787
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,850
No, I really haven't been hunting.

788
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,350
And even if I had,

789
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,690
the rewards should belong to
the person who earned them.

790
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,310
Listen to him!

791
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,360
Look,

792
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,940
the reason we've survived

793
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,650
this long at Geumho Station is
because we all work together!

794
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,450
Ah, alright.

795
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,280
I'm sure that's true.

796
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,490
But,

797
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,830
where did you hear
that I have a lot of coins?

798
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,120
Is that important?

799
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,040
Just go to the office and hand them over.

800
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,090
Do you know how hard things are for us?

801
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,300
So please tell me.

802
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,880
Then I'll give each of you
100 coins separately,

803
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,550
how about that?

804
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,800
-100 coins? -Who was it?

805
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:02,260
Was it Bang Cheol-soo?

806
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,560
It was me.

807
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,400
I thought someone of your capability
must have substantial coins.

808
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,940
However, those who have much
are often reluctant to give.

809
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,240
My intention was to help you
understand the plight of the residents here.

810
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,200
But given everyone's difficult circumstances,

811
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,870
my approach seems to
have been discourteous.

812
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,910
I apologize for

813
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,410
any offense.

814
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,830
Ah, no, it's fine. I don't mind.

815
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,880
Mr. Kim Do-ja.

816
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,000
We are short by twenty people's worth today.

817
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,880
I am trying everything to protect our residents.

818
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,300
Please help us.

819
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,050
I beg you.

820
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,520
Wait.

821
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,100
Now I remember

822
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,810
who this guy is.

823
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:54,770
I'm afraid I can't

824
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,900
give you any coins.

825
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,370
So you don't care if residents die, is that it?

826
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,740
Even if they survive today,
what about tomorrow?

827
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:13,690
Fine, whatever.

828
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,790
Stop talking.

829
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,430
Just stop.

830
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,670
I thought Kim Do-ja was a good guy.

831
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,530
I must have misjudged him.

832
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,990
Alright, I'll help you.

833
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,160
But even if I give you coins today,

834
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,360
you'll need more tomorrow.

835
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:59,750
Main Scenario #2: Geumho Station
Clear Condition: Pass through the tunnel and eliminate all monsters that appear.
(Each person must pay a 100-coin survival tax before scenario clear.)
Category: Main
Reward: 5,000 Coins
Difficulty: D
Failure: Death
Time Limit: None

836
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,120
So, I will clear this scenario and

837
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,060
exterminate all the monsters by the end of today.

838
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,430
Will that suffice?

839
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,030
Cheon In-ho of Geumho Station

840
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,580
a monster that abandoned the right to be human.

841
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:12,090
sold his humanity to his sponsor.

842
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,810
He's using ants instead of people?

843
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,300
Is that even allowed?

844
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,300
Judging from what happened to you,

845
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,110
that rumor must be true.

846
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,870
Right now, Kim Do-ja has the highest stats

847
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:30,080
and the most coins at Geumho Station.

848
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,690
With that much, he might actually
be able to clear the scenario here.

849
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,780
Bang Cheol-soo, how many times
do I have to tell you?

850
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,350
As long as I'm here,
no one is breaking any scenario.

851
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,310
Ah, yes. Right, right. Of course.

852
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,230
It's human nature to bow to the strong.

853
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,620
Those who were once silent,

854
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,150
once they suddenly gain power,

855
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,170
start thinking they're hot stuff

856
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,100
and become arrogant.

857
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,970
It's just childish vanity.

858
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,770
In this world, people like that die first.

859
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,730
Then, after that guy dies,

860
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,190
we need to get our hands
on his coins first.

861
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,330
Roughly how many are there?

862
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,400
I heard he has
tens of thousands of coins.

863
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,760
Is that right, Mr. Han?

864
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,590
It's true.

865
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,530
Excuse me. I saw it clearly.

866
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,170
Enjoy your meal.

867
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:40,120
I'm not going. Why should I go?
We'll die if we go!

868
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,860
You won't die. Let's go together.

869
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,970
I want to go too, Mister!
I want to fight the monsters with you!

870
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,320
Ever since earlier, you keep talking
about fighting monsters.

871
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,040
You're an elementary schooler. No.

872
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,740
Do-ja, if you have coins to spare,

873
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,010
wouldn't it be better to just
distribute them to everyone?

874
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,830
Yeah, why do we have to do this?

875
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,440
My god! Ours doesn't count!

876
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,530
People die at this station
even if they have coins.

877
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,880
To stop the sacrifices,

878
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,780
we need to find the cause and solve it.

879
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,440
Right, Jeong Hee-won?

880
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,250
In the novel,

881
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,570
Jeong Hee-won lost her friends
fighting against Cheon In-ho

882
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,580
and died in a convenience store.

883
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,310
The present Jeong Hee-won
is now just pure rage.

884
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,280
So the congressman-like guy
is the root cause? Why?

885
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,150
When I found Hee-won,
she hadn't been killed by a monster.

886
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,210
Bang Cheol-soo works with them.

887
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,130
They recruit people for the scouting team

888
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,510
under the pretext of hunting for coins,
then kill everyone secretly after the hunt.

889
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,480
My friends and I were killed
when we tried to stop him.

890
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,170
What? Why kill people?

891
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,070
When people die, their coins drop.

892
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,770
That bastard Cheon In-ho isn't human.

893
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,370
It's too dark in here.

894
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,160
We can't even walk properly,
let alone argue.

895
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,900
Gil-yeong, can you help me?

896
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,150
Me? Can I really help?

897
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:10,390
What are you two planning?

898
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,970
Just show me that thing

899
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:14,910
you were thinking about earlier.

900
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,660
Hey, Lee Gil-yeong,

901
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,090
if you call out the cockroaches again...

902
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,590
Wow, Lee Gil-yeong.

903
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,670
They're about to appear.

904
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,900
Everyone, make good use of
your Constellation Sponsors.

905
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,910
You all know how to use coins
to raise your stats, right?

906
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:06,870
Maximize your strength and agility.

907
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,280
Maximize them?

908
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,110
Just in case, about the survival tax...

909
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,170
Alright, maintain formation.

910
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,110
Don't fight alone. Help each other.

911
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,080
Gil-yeong, maintain the firefly light.

912
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,250
Do I get to fight too?

913
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,430
You stay behind me.

914
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,010
Leave this to me.

915
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,690
Okay, if we follow that...

916
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,270
Mister,

917
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,140
if we take this path,

918
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,140
a really powerful monster will appear, right?

919
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,210
The fireflies told me.

920
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,140
I'm not sure.

921
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,760
Mister, you've known
everything from the start.

922
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,780
You're like a god.

923
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,320
If I were a god,
would I be in this situation?

924
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,580
If a god truly exists,

925
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:26,870
then that author is the god.

926
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,380
Sang-ah, are you there?

927
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,760
Do-ja, I'm tied up here!

928
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,400
Ah! What is that?

929
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,510
You have entered the territory of the Grasshopper-Rat Shaman.
Please repel the Dark Guardians.

930
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,700
You have entered the territory
of the Grasshopper-Rat Shaman.

931
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,440
I'll go in first.

932
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,880
A demon species as expected,
I need an item.

933
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,190
Do-ja, I'm coming!

934
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,740
Hyun-seong, it won't work.

935
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,760
What's happening?

936
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,270
It actually works?

937
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,710
At the Dark Guardian's request,
the Phantom Prison has been activated.

938
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:52,660
Phantom Prison?

939
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,320
The Phantom Prison, which confines
the body and devours the spirit.

940
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:02,300
Victims suffer, tormented by their most
terrifying memories until they die.

941
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,800
Run!

942
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,120
What's this?

943
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,370
Wait!

944
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,920
Gil-yeong! Gil-yeong! No!

945
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,200
Over there!

946
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,870
Hee-won, buy me some time.

947
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,780
-Hey, Pil, you can see this right?
-Yes, Mr. Do-ja.

948
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:31,600
What do you need?

949
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,860
Open the Goblin Bag for me.

950
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,870
How much for
the 'White Pure Yang Energy'?

951
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,760
50,000 Coins. You don't have that much.

952
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,590
You've bought White Pure Yang Energy
with 50,000 coins.

953
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,500
This weapon can perform
a single, powerful critical strike.

954
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,450
Hyun-seong.

955
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,540
He woke up.

956
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,900
Are you okay?

957
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,300
I'm sorry. I think I fell asleep.

958
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,210
Wait.

959
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,690
You'll be fine after some rest.

960
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:37,090
In the novel, Lee Hyun-seong could

961
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,140
never overcome the guilt of
failing to save someone,

962
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,880
which held his abilities back.

963
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,500
The current Lee Hyun-seong is still
the same as the one in the novel.

964
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,000
Good work, everyone.

965
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:55,150
I just saw something that
looked like a treasure chest.

966
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,780
Let's go open it.

967
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,760
Hee-won's is two knives,
and Hyun-seong's is an arm guard.

968
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,410
What about Gil-yeong?

969
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,780
I seem to be able to hear the insects
better now that I'm wearing this.

970
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,080
Look.

971
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,580
Good.

972
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,740
I'm sure I'll be able to fight better with this on.

973
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,400
I'll open mine.

974
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,480
Oh, it's defective.

975
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,430
How come the hardest working people
come up with stuff like that.

976
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,460
It doesn't matter.
It's all good for something. Let's go.

977
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,980
That's it. Broken faith.

978
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,520
Now just find the Ether of Faith.

979
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,270
The weapon will be complete.

980
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,760
What's this?

981
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,270
Uncle, I found this.

982
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,480
What's this?

983
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,920
If you eat this.

984
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,800
Then those white hands just now will appear.

985
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,510
You'll have nightmares.

986
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,420
That's why you should never touch it.

987
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,520
Okay?

988
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,900
Yes.

989
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,360
Do-ja.

990
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,350
How do you know?

991
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:22,960
What?

992
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:26,210
The curry smearing thing just now.

993
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,830
And you seem to know this place.

994
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,090
It's like you've lived in this world.

995
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:33,060
Right? Sis.

996
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,780
I'm not the only one who thinks so.

997
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,070
Who the hell are you?

998
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,400
I…

999
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,760
I can do nothing.

1000
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,390
No special skill.

1001
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:50,090
But I know a little bit about the future.

1002
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,780
It's like a form of precognition.

1003
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,610
Can you really know the future?

1004
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:54,810
Precognitive ability.

1005
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,850
Wow, that's cool.

1006
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,570
So what will the world be like in the future.

1007
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,260
Can you know that?

1008
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,320
The world can return to what it was before.

1009
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,930
Really?

1010
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,260
When?

1011
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,380
When can I go home?

1012
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,390
It will take a very long time.

1013
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,350
What should we do?

1014
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,090
Just complete the 99th scene at the end.

1015
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,630
The 99th scene?

1016
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,740
Who can do that?

1017
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,720
Only one person.

1018
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,560
Can do all of these.

1019
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,790
The protagonist who saves this world

1020
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,270
It can't be you?

1021
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,960
You two should have seen him before at the East Lake Bridge.

1022
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,490
Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

1023
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,760
That man?

1024
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,320
He's super cool.

1025
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,690
But the thing is.

1026
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,680
If Yoo died in battle when fighting a monster tomorrow.

1027
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,440
What would things be like if he died?

1028
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,860
The world is over.

1029
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,710
It's impossible to go back to the way it was before.

1030
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,540
He should be on Chungmuro Road now.

1031
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,350
After the scene is completed, the boundary will be lifted.

1032
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,410
I'll go over there.

1033
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,260
To stop it.

1034
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,310
No, wait.

1035
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,550
Didn't we just finish the scene?

1036
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,360
There is only one left.

1037
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,240
There are still ten minutes until the end

1038
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:44,470
Geumho.

1039
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,000
- Humans in the area, please get ready to pay.
- After the reconnaissance team leaves

1040
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,380
What does it mean to
snatch game currency and kill people?

1041
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,940
The child's father hasn't come back yet.

1042
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,580
Shit.

1043
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,330
What can you do if I kill him.

1044
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:56,250
You didn't.

1045
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,130
What can you do?

1046
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,900
Shit.

1047
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,810
I said I would kill you

1048
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,030
Just go.

1049
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,860
Jeong Hee-won.

1050
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,040
Since we're going to look for a scene to pass the level.

1051
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,330
One should either break the boundaries or die.

1052
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,970
What are you doing?

1053
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,200
I'm here to pass the level.

1054
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,810
There is still one monster left here

1055
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:35,240
What are you waiting for?

1056
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,670
Kill them all and snatch the game currency.

1057
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:51,200
Jeong Hee-won did not appear much in the killing method.

1058
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,180
And it was not well utilized in the story either.

1059
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,430
So perhaps the character
 I'm most looking forward to making an appearance.

1060
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,130
Hee-won, in this chapter.

1061
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:01,940
She is the main character.

1062
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:07,530
The devilish and fiery judge agreed to use this skill.

1063
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,820
The trial has been activated

1064
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,210
Wait.

1065
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,490
Miss.

1066
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,460
You're not really going to kill him now, are you?

1067
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,770
You may not know.

1068
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,270
We won't finish the scene.

1069
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,880
Because if you finish, the next level will be harder.

1070
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:41,310
After unlocking the next scene at
the Dongdae Entrance Station over there.

1071
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,630
They're all dead.

1072
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,810
Might as well bite the bullet and live.

1073
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,050
Hey, interrupt for a second.

1074
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,290
You guys are really weird.

1075
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,370
Why are you talking about this now?

1076
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,510
We spent all our coins to complete the scene.

1077
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,130
Fighting monsters.

1078
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,930
Everyone who goes to finish the scene dies.

1079
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:58,870
We thought…

1080
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,580
Same goes for you guys.

1081
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:04,770
Didn't you see that gold is lost when you die?

1082
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,350
All these gold coins will be
 distributed to us after recycling.

1083
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,690
Who'd have thought you'd come back alive?

1084
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:11,980
Yeah.

1085
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,340
Why is the world like this?

1086
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,380
Human.

1087
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,080
How can we be punished like this?

1088
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,960
Is Yoo Jeong-hyuk

1089
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,490
talking about this?

1090
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,430
Kim Do-ja.

1091
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,040
So now…

1092
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,650
No more survival money, no more play money.

1093
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:42,320
Three minutes left to pay the survival fee.

1094
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,860
Humans in the region please pay as soon as possible.

1095
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,040
One minute left to pay the subsistence fee.

1096
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,300
Be prepared to pay for their survival.

1097
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,530
Hee-won, get him now.

1098
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,650
What's so surprising?

1099
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,430
That's the line.

1100
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,450
Don't you know you can't pass
a scene without completing it?

1101
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,880
Monsters other than me.

1102
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,170
You took care of it for me.

1103
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,780
It's almost time.

1104
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,700
Let's call it a day.

1105
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,020
Your rusty meritocracy is a problem.

1106
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,560
That's why you're dead.

1107
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,370
Quick, get out of the way!

1108
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,360
All monsters have been destroyed.

1109
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,350
Survival fee payment has been cancelled.

1110
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:12,420
The main scenario has been completed.

1111
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,230
Who's there?

1112
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,450
Uncle, what are you doing?

1113
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,190
I saved you guys.

1114
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,690
Shouldn't you thank me?

1115
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,300
I arrested him.
You don't have a problem with that, do you?

1116
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,150
Don't be afraid.

1117
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,950
You look like beggars.

1118
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,000
Yes, thank you.

1119
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,840
She seems pretty good. Let's get out of here.

1120
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,070
Where are you going? We still have to finish the scene.

1121
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:55,570
We've just finished the scene.

1122
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,550
That's for that area.

1123
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,450
Aren't you guys new to the area?

1124
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,610
Oh, my God. What is this?

1125
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,880
Is the road blocked again?

1126
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,000
Oh, by the way, just so you know.

1127
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,150
The scene here is not
 one of unity and working together.

1128
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,040
Instead, you're each trying to figure it out.

1129
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,200
Are you going to stand there forever?

1130
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,800
I suggest you run for it.

1131
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:25,690
Lee Ji-hye.

1132
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:32,960
Main Scene #1: Proof of Value
 Pass Condition
 Kill at least one life form

1133
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,950
The first scene in the novel begins.

1134
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,440
When everyone's locked up.

1135
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:37,400
Ji-hye. What are we going to do now?

1136
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,790
Lee Ji-hye.

1137
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,360
Survived alone.

1138
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:47,490
The fourth day of the Chungmuro Station
scene will now begin.

1139
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,440
Ten minutes before the monster comes out.

1140
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,310
The safe zone is about to open.

1141
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,560
Chungmuro.

1142
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,940
Please flee to safety.

1143
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,070
Survive the monster.

1144
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,400
Current number of survivors 104.

1145
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:56,900
Notify
 of the current number of survivors, 104.

1146
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,440
Inform
 that the number of safe zones today is 52
 please go to the safe zones for shelter.

1147
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,640
The number of safe zones today is 52.

1148
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,720
Please go to a safe place.

1149
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,640
Ten minutes left.

1150
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,240
750 coins per person if you want to survive.

1151
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,100
It's safe in here.

1152
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,090
Ten minutes left.

1153
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:23,110
There's not much room left.

1154
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,650
There's not much room left. Ten minutes left.

1155
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,420
Uncle.

1156
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,130
I'm alone. I have cash. How much is enough?

1157
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:31,800
He said cash.

1158
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,340
Uncle.

1159
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,540
We don't take cash.

1160
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:37,360
You go get the coins.

1161
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,900
I don't have any coins right now.

1162
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,510
I'll take as much cash as you want. How much?

1163
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:41,820
-Uncle. - $20 million or $30 million?

1164
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:50,950
1 person 1 night 750 gaming coins.

1165
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,860
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1166
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,460
Don't you see what it says?

1167
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:46,920
Can you make an exception?

1168
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,010
All this adds up to about 100 million won.

1169
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,260
Please.

1170
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,740
All right, you're out of here.

1171
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,540
No, no.

1172
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,160
-Uncle. - Wait a minute.

1173
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,060
Wait.

1174
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,840
Where did you get 100 million won in cash?

1175
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,920
I came from Myeongdong yesterday.

1176
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,590
There's someone there who
exchanges game coins for money.

1177
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,690
1 game coin 100,000 won.

1178
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,660
I think there's no telling when
the world will go back to the way it was.

1179
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,300
I changed it just in case.

1180
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,960
What's the problem?

1181
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,220
That's money from my vault.

1182
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:21,040
It's because of you people
 who have ambitions for money.

1183
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,610
I'm the one who became a coin-op.

1184
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,130
You're so young, you don't know how the world works.

1185
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,180
Looks like you're gonna die in a foreign land today.

1186
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,080
Intrusive.

1187
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:46,810
What need is there for those poor people
 to struggle to survive?

1188
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:50,140
Anyone who doesn't have money is going to die anyway.

1189
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,100
It's not even official yet.

1190
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,280
Do we have to fight like this every day here?

1191
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,250
Since midnight, monsters
have been storming the underground stations.

1192
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,280
If you can get into the green gerry, you'll survive.

1193
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,520
From now on, we'll split up and look for openings.

1194
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,410
Listen.

1195
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,770
There's probably no room for the five of us.

1196
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,410
If you can find a spot.

1197
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,580
It's got to hold.

1198
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:25,130
Main Scene #3: Safe Zone (Day 4/5)
 Passing Conditions
 Survive the monsters that swarm over you every night
 Safe in the 'Safe Zone'
 Classification: Main Line Reward: 10,000 coins
 Difficulty: C On Failure: Death
 This scenario will be run for 5 days

1199
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,110
That's how we'll survive at least one of us.

1200
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:21,810
Got it?

1201
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,620
There's no vacancy on Chungmu Road now.

1202
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:33,830
If you want to survive,
you have to take someone else's place.

1203
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,570
Uncle, you're the prophet, aren't you?

1204
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,220
I heard it from my master.

1205
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:44,580
Well, you're here now,
so I guess the prophecy did work.

1206
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,900
Where's Yoo Jeong-hyuk?

1207
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,400
He's long gone.

1208
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:56,050
The scene here is not of
 the same magnitude as my master's.

1209
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,480
But why aren't you moving?

1210
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,080
The prophet should know
where the bonus safety zone will be.

1211
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,680
Why?

1212
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,720
You're the only one who can survive, so think about it?

1213
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,800
Master told me to tell you.

1214
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,280
When the time comes,
the offer will be accepted, so don't babysit.

1215
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,840
You must survive tonight.

1216
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,560
What?

1217
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,880
You're the only one who can survive, so think about it?

1218
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,600
But what happens if I win? I already told you.

1219
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,440
Let's go.

1220
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,400
I told you.

1221
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,360
Didn't I tell you?

1222
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,640
You might as well give up.

1223
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,040
It's better to survive one than both.

1224
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,320
Give it to me.

1225
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,200
It's mine. Give it to me.

1226
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,760
6-1 6-1

1227
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,880
6-1 Ride gate set back five squares.

1228
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,480
Do-ja.

1229
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,240
I've searched them all. There's no room.

1230
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,520
Gil-yeong, this way.

1231
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,600
Do you know any other places?

1232
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,960
Death to all of them.

1233
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,960
I'm Pil-roo in charge of the Chungmuro scene.

1234
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,200
One minute to scene start.

1235
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,560
How come you guys didn't fight as hard as yesterday?

1236
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,480
Tired of playing for days?

1237
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,480
What do you care if it's a safety zone or something?

1238
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,520
Why don't we let the monsters out now?

1239
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,280
We're going to have to pull it up a bit today.

1240
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,280
Those who haven't found a place yet.

1241
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,200
This is your last chance.

1242
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,640
Let's get moving.

1243
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,640
One minute until the monster comes out.

1244
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,280
Some security zones will be deleted

1245
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,400
and generate bonus safety zones.

1246
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,440
Do-ja, don't just stand there, we need to hurry up too...

1247
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,160
Is this also precognition?

1248
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,320
There's no stopping the scene.

1249
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,840
You have to go in there.

1250
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,040
They'll die if they're thrown out, won't they?

1251
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,840
It's the only way to survive.

1252
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,360
Can't you fight like before?

1253
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,920
How many?

1254
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,720
No.

1255
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,520
You'll die if you don't have a place here.

1256
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,400
Portal generation complete.

1257
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,840
Monsters are on the loose.

1258
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,320
We need to get in there fast.

1259
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,880
Can't you get in?

1260
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,240
Why don't you go in?

1261
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,520
We're dead.

1262
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,480
Wait.

1263
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,120
To get to that portal over there.

1264
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,800
And there.

1265
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,840
It's going to get more dangerous, isn't it?

1266
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,080
All scenes

1267
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,680
are all for the pleasure of the Sons.

1268
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,240
The rules can be changed if they're interesting enough.

1269
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,840
In the most dangerous places, there may be safe places.

1270
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,480
Quick.

1271
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,400
I have a bad feeling about this.

1272
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,200
There's a safety zone.

1273
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,280
-But, Uncle.
 - I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

1274
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,520
Just stay there.

1275
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,040
Why did you come back?

1276
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,240
Of all the novels I've read.

1277
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,240
There's a story where only the main character survives.

1278
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,960
That main character really isn't very good.

1279
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:46,960
Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

1280
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,600
Move.

1281
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,520
You're okay without a safety zone, right?

1282
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,880
You offered to catch a fire dragon with me.

1283
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,920
My condition is this.

1284
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,880
Give up the kid. You come in.

1285
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,400
Or you'll die.

1286
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,960
Hyun-seong, grab it!

1287
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,640
-You stay here. - What about you, Uncle?

1288
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,720
Eat this. I'll be put in Phantom Prison.

1289
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,400
No wonder.

1290
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,840
Phantom Sword Mark activated.

1291
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,640
It's done. It's done.

1292
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,840
You hit each other.

1293
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,320
Quickly.

1294
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,240
Cool.

1295
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,240
Stop.

1296
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,600
Sorry.

1297
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,680
Kim Do-ja is cool.

1298
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,200
Yoo Jeong-hyuk said.

1299
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,360
There's nothing wrong with
 sacrificing someone else so that I can live.

1300
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,480
Is that what this novel is about?

1301
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,880
I can't agree.

1302
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:04,000
Author, this novel sucks.

1303
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,000
Min-seop died yesterday.

1304
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,320
I'm working on the details, too.

1305
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,720
Don't get any ideas.

1306
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,560
Take a serious mock exam

1307
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,920
Author.

1308
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,160
I once let a friend die to stay alive.

1309
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,480
But Yoo Jeong-hyuk in the novel

1310
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,360
said it wasn't his fault.

1311
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,640
It's hopeless.

1312
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,160
That's why I'm also in favour of Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

1313
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,280
Until I saw the end today.

1314
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,280
I thought the ending was horrible.

1315
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,200
I'm afraid I'll become like that.

1316
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,880
Author.

1317
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,560
I'd like to see other endings.

1318
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,720
Things I can't do.

1319
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,320
No matter what it costs the hero.

1320
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:45,160
All will live to see the end with their mates.

1321
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,760
Funny.

1322
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:52,120
Yoo Jeong-hyuk is using the Dream Dialogue skill.

1323
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,480
Then you should have beaten that guy.

1324
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,160
I know what you're trying to say.

1325
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,720
Help each other out or something.

1326
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,600
Human nature simply can't do it.

1327
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,640
I used to think like you.

1328
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,160
But losing countless companions
 on a hellish battlefield.

1329
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,960
Instead, you'll find it easier to fight alone.

1330
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,560
So, what do we do now?

1331
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,320
Why do you think you should do what you do?

1332
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,160
You're nothing.

1333
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,920
It's too deep to recover from.

1334
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,560
Do-ja, are you feeling better?

1335
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,320
It's been three days.
 I was afraid you wouldn't wake up.

1336
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,000
How's everybody doing?

1337
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,720
Hyun-seong?

1338
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,720
Do-ja.

1339
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,360
It's a blessing that you're finally awake.

1340
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,040
Hyun-seong is too hardworking.

1341
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,280
Sang-ah has done everything she can to cure you.

1342
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,720
Are you sure you're okay?

1343
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,800
Yeah.

1344
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,280
Did you spend the night fighting monsters?

1345
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,360
For me?

1346
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,280
It's time.

1347
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,240
It's time for our next scene.

1348
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,840
The mates survived outside the safe zone.

1349
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,760
It's time to wake up.

1350
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,280
We're all working together.

1351
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,400
Time to go.

1352
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:31,960
Wake up.

1353
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,680
The way to get through this scene.

1354
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,040
Hyun-seong and Gil-yeong
 may not be able to fight today.

1355
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,240
We'll get the two safe zone locations first.

1356
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,880
The others are holding up outside.

1357
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:49,320
Yoo Jeong-hyuk will die today.

1358
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,600
On the last day of the Chungmuro scene,
the Fire Dragon Monster will appear.

1359
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,640
Yoo Jeong-hyuk will fight it and die.

1360
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,760
Didn't you say the world would end if you died?

1361
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,840
Well, to be precise,
if the hero who saves the world dies.

1362
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,880
That world will be completely gone in minutes.

1363
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,320
Trying to keep the world from disappearing.

1364
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,320
Someone has to fight the fire dragon for him.

1365
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,560
If we come to fight.

1366
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,080
So one of us is gonna die?

1367
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,400
I'll do it.

1368
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:29,080
If it hadn't been for Uncle, I'd have died there.

1369
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,080
What should I do?

1370
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,640
No.

1371
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,560
You're going to do something else.

1372
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,400
I'll fight.

1373
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,680
Wait.

1374
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,880
Yoo Jeong-hyuk is much higher than us.

1375
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,240
He's nothing like us.

1376
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,200
That person is going to die.

1377
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,360
How do you fight, Do-ja?

1378
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,750
You protected me last night.

1379
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,420
Thank you.

1380
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,770
Thanks to you, I know.

1381
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,950
What should I do today?

1382
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,050
Current number of survivors 57

1383
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:09,700
Bulletin
 Current number of survivors 57

1384
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,800
The number of safe zones today is

1385
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,950
Notices are now being posted.

1386
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,570
Attention.

1387
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:23,100
You all know that the rules of
this scenario are to go your own way.

1388
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,070
The core concept is surviving alone.

1389
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:29,120
But, last night, someone survived
outside the safety zone.

1390
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,470
And they worked with each other to survive.

1391
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:35,070
Our ancestors were furious about it.

1392
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,370
So, we're gonna up the ante today.

1393
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,250
Current number of survivors 57.

1394
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:44,250
The number of safe zones today is 1.

1395
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,350
-What? - There's only one.

1396
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,570
Quiet! Quiet!

1397
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:54,550
I'll personally decide who gets the only spot.

1398
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,250
Who should I give it to?

1399
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:57,770
To the kindest of people.

1400
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:00,070
The poorest of the poor.

1401
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,970
Or the smartest.

1402
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,870
But in your old world,
 isn't money the most powerful thing in the world?

1403
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,700
Then let's do it.

1404
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,700
Safety zones are being created

1405
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,250
If you want to live,
 you guys unite and try to take this position away.

1406
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,370
But even then, there's only one position.

1407
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:31,620
Wait.

1408
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:35,020
Ji-hye, can you help me?

1409
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:37,820
Why? I'll find it myself.

1410
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:41,470
Come on. Let's do this together.

1411
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:48,570
If you'd stayed put yesterday,
this wouldn't have happened.

1412
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,420
It's because of your false courage
 that everyone here is going to die.

1413
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,320
That's why I'm asking you to help me.

1414
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,570
I have my own plans, Ji-hye.
All you have to do is fire a shot...

1415
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,900
I said no.

1416
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:02,420
I thought you saw who the safe zone was for.

1417
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,000
Only the strong survive in this world.

1418
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,170
I don't think it could be any better.

1419
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,270
It's the easiest and fairest, isn't it?

1420
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,650
If you don't want to die, just beat everyone else.

1421
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,950
You killed a friend.

1422
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,600
Isn't it enough that you survived on your own?

1423
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:23,550
That friend, even in death.

1424
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,300
And he didn't laid a finger on you.

1425
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:31,600
It can't be helped.

1426
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,300
It can't be helped.

1427
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,450
I know.

1428
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:46,470
Sorry.

1429
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,550
But you know what happens
 when you try to survive alone.

1430
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,300
Pil, there you are.

1431
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:12,420
Do-ja. Wow, that's great.

1432
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,520
Just like you said, our channel is on fire.

1433
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,400
Now people still say
the story is funny Being rewarded...

1434
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,900
That reward. Let's settle up now.

1435
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,200
How much do you want?

1436
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,420
All.

1437
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:36,920
Wait for my signal. Put it all in.

1438
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,620
Just a moment, please. I'll check out.

1439
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:42,570
Uncle.

1440
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,620
Uncle Kung Pil-doo.

1441
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,270
And where did that beggar come from?

1442
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,670
Uncle, do you want to get a job?

1443
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,170
What?

1444
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:00,970
I'd like to hire you for the day.

1445
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,650
What is the appropriate daily rate?

1446
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:06,120
I thought you were a beggar
 turned out to be a madman What are you talking about?

1447
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,620
Will about 100,000 be enough?

1448
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,920
100,000.

1449
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:12,520
100,000.

1450
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,350
Okay, for 100,000, I'll be at your disposal all day.

1451
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,650
Do you have that many coins?

1452
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:19,920
Sure.

1453
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:21,350
Pil, now.

1454
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,050
Yes. Now turn around.

1455
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,550
One hundred and thirteen thousand coins.

1456
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,900
Re-generation of security zones.

1457
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,570
My place.

1458
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,070
No.

1459
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,620
This maniac.

1460
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,150
Hey.

1461
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:52,020
Shit, don't.

1462
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,570
I'm gonna shoot.

1463
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,050
Go on, damn it.

1464
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,170
I know it can't be helped.

1465
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:05,320
But, you know, you're just trying to survive on your own.

1466
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,020
What's going to happen to you?

1467
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:10,850
Let go of me.

1468
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:37,850
Hey, hey.

1469
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:40,600
Hey.

1470
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,150
This maniac really broke it.

1471
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:44,400
Let go of me.

1472
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:46,520
Hey, you bastard.

1473
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,800
What about my land?

1474
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,320
What now?

1475
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,020
Monsters appears. 1 minute.

1476
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,000
The portal is being generated.

1477
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,270
From the beginning.

1478
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,120
Without that safety zone.

1479
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,320
We would have fought together.

1480
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,900
Maybe everyone will survive.

1481
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,420
100,000 transferred.

1482
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:14,850
What?

1483
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,270
I hired you today, you have to keep your word.

1484
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,400
What do you want?

1485
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,420
None of the people here must die.

1486
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:22,870
I've got a head count.

1487
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:27,070
What do we do now?

1488
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,300
Hey.

1489
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:34,670
I'm not taking any money today.

1490
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:37,120
Guys who think they can fight go ahead and do it.

1491
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,970
If you don't think it's a good idea,
you'll have to come into my place.

1492
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,020
Quick.

1493
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,620
I'm taking this opportunity to make a fortune in coins.

1494
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:57,270
Kong Pil-doo's backstar defence master
 has come to support the emergency defence.

1495
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,020
Gil-yeong and Hyun-seong aren't here today.

1496
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,270
We have to fight harder.

1497
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:10,600
Gentlemen, please don't die.

1498
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,950
You bastards.

1499
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:37,400
Uncle.

1500
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:39,020
I'll take that side.

1501
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,200
Keep blocking.

1502
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,350
You go.

1503
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,220
Hey, Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

1504
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,800
You'll die if you do. I'll do it.

1505
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,420
With that sword of yours.

1506
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,700
Your prophecy that I would die
was four days ago, wasn't it?

1507
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:10,850
Watch this.

1508
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:46,870
Humans with abnormal ability values
 detected in the region

1509
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,270
With the consent of all constellations

1510
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,250
Scenario difficulty will be adjusted upwards.

1511
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,120
What?

1512
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,220
It's not in the novel.

1513
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,820
Sang-ah, we have to get it out now.

1514
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:18,170
Do-ja, what are you going to do?

1515
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:20,020
The flames should be blocked with this.

1516
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,370
Now.

1517
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:20,920
This will kill you.

1518
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,350
Gil-yeong.

1519
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,400
-Gil-yeong. -Where is Do-ja?

1520
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,920
Lee Gil-yeong.

1521
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:41,970
Stop!

1522
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,520
It's okay. I can do it.

1523
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:55,920
That's enough now. Stop it.

1524
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:58,640
Stop. Please don't go on.

1525
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:17,700
Announcement
 Lee Hyun-seong's skills will soon begin to evolve

1526
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:18,900
Lee Hyun-seong's skills will soon begin to evolve.

1527
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,170
Sang-ah.

1528
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:15,040
Lee Hyun-seong uses the fourth stage of the force to push Mount.Tai.

1529
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,070
Hyun-seong, I'll kill him.

1530
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:29,780
Take care.

1531
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:48,300
I'll do whatever it takes to catch up with the fire dragon.

1532
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:49,820
Listen to what I'm about to say.

1533
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:52,050
In the middle of the fire dragon's body.

1534
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,440
There's a core inside a round shell.

1535
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:57,790
If you pierce the core, you can catch the fire dragon.

1536
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:59,540
But here's the thing.

1537
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:01,750
The man who broke the outer skin of the nuclear core.

1538
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,730
Would die.

1539
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:07,110
After I break the core, I'll be dead.

1540
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,070
Sang-ah will catch the fire dragon with a line.

1541
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:11,850
Hee-Won is going to pierce the core.

1542
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:13,740
Catch the fire dragon like this.

1543
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,690
And there's a special bonus.

1544
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:17,550
This special bonus

1545
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,410
is the only chance to bring back the dead.

1546
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,410
You know what I mean.

1547
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:26,490
We have to believe in each other and fight.

1548
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,730
This is what will keep us all alive.

1549
01:42:32,190 --> 01:42:33,490
The only way.

1550
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:25,770
Do-ja.

1551
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:33,270
Hee-won, now.

1552
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,160
Hee-won.

1553
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:07,550
The core shell is healing again.

1554
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,800
What should we do now?

1555
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:30,600
The only way to end this fight.

1556
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:29,470
The core shell's ruptured.

1557
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:31,910
Now Yoo Jeong-hyuk is going to die.

1558
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:34,710
Just like in the novel.

1559
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:40,920
Kim Do-ja.

1560
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:43,370
What are you gonna do?

1561
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,450
The protagonist is dead.

1562
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:08,510
I couldn't do anything.

1563
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,870
Returning skills of Yoo Jeong-hyuk
to be activated soon.

1564
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:20,510
All the matter of this world will be annihilated.

1565
01:46:55,350 --> 01:47:00,690
Announcement
 Ichthyosaurus's core and Faith's Ether
 completed the swap deal
 Trader Name:tls123

1566
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:12,200
If you're not happy with the ending, please rewrite it yourself.

1567
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:15,740
Then the reader is invited to

1568
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,490
show.

1569
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,200
The way you want it to end.

1570
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,870
Hey Pil.

1571
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:27,220
Bring me the trade in props, now!

1572
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:30,270
Do-ja, the world is being wiped out.
What are you going to do?

1573
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:31,520
Bring it to me.

1574
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:46,090
Fractured beliefs are being transformed
into characterised weapons.

1575
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:54,610
There's still a chance.

1576
01:47:58,110 --> 01:47:59,620
Hyun-seong.

1577
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,550
Hee-won.

1578
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:12,480
Sang-ah.

1579

1581
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:05,910
Received a reward of 10,000 coins.

1582

Announcement

1583
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:10,200
You have received an
 extra special reward from the King of No Kill.

1584
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,390

01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:15,190
to get Yoo Jeong-hyuk back.

1586
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,060
Yoo Jeong-hyuk.

1587
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:42,400
Are you all right?

1588
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,230
I thought you couldn't do it.

1589
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:08,330
Thank you.

1590
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,120
