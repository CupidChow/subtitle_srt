00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,894
Please wake up, ma'am!

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,062
Doctor.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,981
I'm sleepy.

5
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,775
No, you can't sleep! Open your eyes!

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,652
It's so cold.

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,695
Please hold on.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,406
Ma'am, what's your name?

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,535
Seo Eun-ju.

10
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,537
Where are we?

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,123
Ma'am! What day is it today?

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,416
What day is it today?

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,003
Your second child was born today!
The birthday!

14
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,965
October 16th.

15
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,216
That's right.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,718
Please hold on.

17
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,395
More blood, please.
And administer more FFP.

18
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,110
CPR. Start compressions.

19
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,445
Pack and cover the abdomen.

20
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,197
-I need an emergency cart!
-Yes, sir!

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,114
More gauze.

22
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,460
Suction.

23
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,090
Let's switch.

24
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,970
A dose of epinephrine, please!

25
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:52,862
You need to feed and hold your babies!

26
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,492
You wanted to see your baby so much.

27
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,080
Eun-ju!

28
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,915
Honey!

29
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,349
How can I live without you?

JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

32
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,606
Dr. Cha is on leave, right?

33
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,735
Yeah, she was really shaken
by the death of the transferred patient.

34
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,237
She cried for days after.

35
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,239
It's understandable.

36
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,534
We saw her bed being wheeled by that day.

37
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,620
And even that glimpse
still gives me nightmares.

38
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,205
That patient had such severe bleeding

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,625
that they did a hysterectomy
and gave 30 units of blood.

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,669
Once DIC set in,
there was nothing they could do.

41
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,587
Goodness.

42
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,590
Postpartum hemorrhage
is what I hate the most.

43
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,342
Why do things like that even happen?

44
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,677
Right? Why do they happen?

45
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,554
-Hello.
-Hello.

46
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,931
There's no way to know.

47
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:48,645
Also, we can't predict in advance
if the patient will develop PPH. Right?

48
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,689
We can't stop the bleeding from happening.

49
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,983
So if it happens,
we must be able to deal with it.

50
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,236
To do that, we need to study more.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,782
So for the next month,
we'll have sessions twice a week.

52
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,659
-Professor, come on.
-Professor, come on.

53
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
You sound pretty eager.
Should we make it three?

54
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:12,502
This week, we'll study
what we can do when PPH does occur.

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,712
What's that?

56
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,715
They're the materials we covered
in Prof. Kong's PPH class last time.

57
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,430
Instead of these…

58
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,185
-Use these.
-Yes, ma'am.

59
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,733
Okay, starting from today,
we'll be doing something very important.

60
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,319
Instead of just theory,
hands-on, practical training.

61
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,572
So if you doze off, sleep…

62
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,535
or not pay attention,
I won't stand for it.

63
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,787
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,420
The most important thing with PPH

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,715
is recognizing it right away
and acting fast.

66
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,302
PPH?

67
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,095
I already gave a lecture on that.

68
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,889
-Yes.
-Then, why is Jung-min…

69
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,850
I mean, why is Prof. Seo doing it again?

70
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,561
Well, there was that last case.

71
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,522
She wants to focus on practical training
for easy understanding…

72
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,440
Easy?

73
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,276
So what I taught last time was hard?

74
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,193
No.

75
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,322
As if it makes a difference
if she does it.

76
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,657
She thinks she can do it all.

77
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,993
God, she's so arrogant.

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,414
Our surgery's at 3:00 p.m., right?

79
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,498
Well…

80
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,961
Prof. Seo has six surgeries today,
and she did an emergency C-section.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,506
And spinal anesthesia failed
in a different surgery,

82
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,342
so they said switching
to general anesthesia delayed things.

83
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,136
So, when's mine?

84
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,014
At around 5:00 p.m.
I've already informed the patient.

85
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,223
What?

86
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,768
Hey, I only have one surgery today.

87
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,062
I'm supposed to wait
until 5:00 p.m. for one surgery?

88
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,316
Prof. Seo has OR priority today.

89
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,861
So she thinks she's the boss today?

90
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,196
And can do whatever she wants?

91
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,823
No!

92
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,575
Ask Anesthesiology for another room.

93
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,952
After a GS surgery,

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,246
they said one might open up at 3:00 p.m.

95
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,999
But Prof. Seo's going to use it too.

96
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,918
If we have two, I should get one.

97
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,252
Why does she get both?

98
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,923
Hold on.
Is she playing mind games with me?

99
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,342
No. She has a lot of surgeries today,

100
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,469
so I don't think
she has the time for that…

101
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,556
Yi-young told me

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,102
she has a meeting
with the hospital director at 6:30 p.m.,

103
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,147
so she has to be done before then
and asked for your understanding…

104
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,649
Why is she meeting the director?

105
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,567
That's something I don't know either.

106
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,735
Damn it.

107
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,030
Tell Jung-min I have to do
my surgery at 3:00 p.m.

108
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,448
I won't do it at 5:00 p.m.

109
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,867
And you make sure we get an OR. Okay?

110
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,874
What do you expect me to do?

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,003
Did you tell Prof. Kong
the surgeries have been delayed?

112
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:01,921
Yes, I did.

113
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,465
I notified them that
she'll do her surgery last as planned.

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,468
And she agreed to it? She didn't complain?

115
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,429
I don't know. I just need to survive.

116
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,935
What I mean is…

117
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,564
You said to make it
so you could leave by 6:00 p.m.

118
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,527
But if I don't, I'll get scolded…

119
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,407
Good job.

120
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,200
What's gotten into you?

121
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,410
Did something happen?

122
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,177
Hey, next Tuesday,
I'll add an induction for Prof. Kong.

123
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,430
You can't. Prof. Seo said
to book one for her too.

124
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,186
Prof. Seo has three inductions on Monday.

125
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,147
We need to do two on Tuesday.

126
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,482
You don't have many patients.

127
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,692
Do it on Thursday.

128
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,486
There's a conference then.

129
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,737
You should do it on Thursday.

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,821
But Seo Jung-min…

131
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,991
She's going too.

132
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,409
I'm dead if I don't book Tuesday.

133
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,037
What about Kong then?
With that temper, I'll be dead too.

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,705
Damn it, this is so annoying.

135
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,291
They should talk it out.
Why make us do it?

136
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,542
I know, right?

137
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,255
Hey, don't they seem weird these days?

138
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,508
They've always been weird and still are.

139
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,884
Well, that's true.

140
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,261
But lately, it seems they've gotten worse.

141
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,304
In what way?

142
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,764
It's a bloody rivalry.

143
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,891
So immature.

144
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,108
I mean, one gets upset
just from hearing the name "Seo Jung-min."

145
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,694
And the other always says no
whenever Kong Gi-sun's mentioned.

146
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,660
And we're stuck in the middle suffering.

147
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,827
It's ridiculous.

148
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,873
Hi!

149
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,791
What's going on?

150
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,417
Why did you come back?

151
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,753
Prof. Im's doing an emergency C-section.

152
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,004
But you're on GYN duties.

153
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,589
Yeah, I'm done with my GYN work.

154
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,341
Then you should go home.

155
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,592
Why observe an OB surgery?

156
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,719
It's an incarceration case,
so how can I go?

157
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,680
What do you mean "how"?
Go as fast as you can.

158
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,641
It's a really rare case.
If not now, I may never get to see.

159
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,520
You're really not going?

160
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,397
We're going…

161
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,314
Home.

162
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,691
Okay, bye!

163
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,991
Hello.

164
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,200
Hey.

165
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,160
You finished your work.
Why are you still here?

166
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,954
There's a surgery I wanted to see.

167
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,794
A surgery you want to see so badly
that you're staying at work?

168
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,087
Yes.

169
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,674
Right, it is a tough surgery.

170
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,759
The approach is unique too.

171
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,805
And for residents, I'm sure seeing
how the hands work will be pretty amazing.

172
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,724
I really think it's amazing.

173
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,270
-Gosh, you don't--
-Goodbye, sir!

174
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:05,938
Where are you going?

175
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,065
The OR changed. It's here.

176
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,108
No, it's not.

177
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,319
Dr. Im's C-section is in OR 6.

178
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,782
Hey, you're on GYN rotation now.

179
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,869
Yes, but they say incarcerations
are unique right from the incision,

180
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,037
so I really want to see it.

181
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
See you tomorrow, sir.

182
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,630
Goodness.

183
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,258
She is just hopeless.

184
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,097
Hey!

185
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,726
Why did you call me?
You're not even ready!

186
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,230
Maybe I should've observed too?

187
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,649
You said you had plans.

188
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,276
Who cares?
They said it's a really rare case.

189
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,905
Incarcer… round?

190
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,157
-Incarceration.
-Right. That.

191
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,409
Are you sure you want to see it?

192
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,744
Right?

193
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,206
You sure you want to see
the surgery and not the Hello Girl?

194
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,375
What are you saying?
Why would I want to see her?

195
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,087
I mean, you've been following
Sa-bi everywhere lately.

196
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,214
-I was just wondering.
-When?

197
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,965
The whole time ever since karaoke night.

198
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,925
Yeah.

199
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,471
I mean, October's almost gone,
and we're almost second-years now.

200
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,766
When you're around Sa-bi,
you learn things.

201
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,393
And she's good at explaining things.

202
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,769
She makes it easy to understand.

203
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,937
Whatever.

204
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,482
If you two end up dating,
you have to tell us first.

205
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,652
After all,
we spend 16 hours a day together.

206
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,362
It would hurt to find out secondhand.

207
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,279
KU DO-WON

208
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,322
You're spinning tales, geez.

209
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,662
Hello?

210
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:46,997
I'm at the hospital…

211
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,167
Sure, I'd…

212
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,461
Sounds good.

213
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,797
Okay, bye.

214
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,302
Who was that?

215
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,429
Are you…

216
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,806
It was my brother-in-law.

217
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,017
He was passing by and is giving me a ride.

218
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,312
Then can you give me
a ride to the bus stop?

219
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,689
It's in the same direction.

220
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,898
Hey, me too.

221
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,775
And I can greet your brother-in-law too.

222
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,527
-No!
-Hey.

223
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,611
Why not?

224
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,988
You can't.

225
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,823
We have things to talk about.

226
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,575
It's family stuff.

227
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,909
Okay, I'll cover my ears then.

228
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,536
Yeah, me too.

229
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,495
No!

230
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,082
Come on. I'm too weak to even walk.

231
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,000
No, no.

232
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,460
Why is everything a "no"?

233
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,129
He's…

234
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,506
very shy.

235
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,885
He hates riding
with people he doesn't know.

236
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,971
I'll give you a ride next time.

237
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,764
Go on.

238
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,392
Yi-young, you're…

239
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,729
so mean.

240
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,814
Bye!

241
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,733
See you tomorrow.

242
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,818
You're mean.

243
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,758
What?

244
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,176
You want me to come?

245
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,887
What? Eat?

246
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,680
Go?

247
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,933
I missed you too!

248
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,521
Stay in the car?

249
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,481
Aren't you coming?

250
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,441
Don't do what?

251
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,318
So you want me to stay in the car?

252
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,112
Come on!

253
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,623
What if someone sees?

254
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,002
If they do, then…

255
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,755
You said they'd assume
we're going the same way.

256
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,133
That's because it was true then,
so it was okay.

257
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,177
But not anymore.

258
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,846
What do you mean?

259
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,890
We still go the same way.

260
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,101
No, I mean…

261
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm just afraid people will talk
about how we're dating.

262
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,274
They can't know yet.

263
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,316
Why not?

264
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,780
Are you worried we might break up
after rumors start going around?

265
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,867
No. We're not going to break up.

266
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,373
It's just…
the first-years don't know anything.

267
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,376
I wonder if I should tell them first.

268
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,462
But where do I even begin to explain?

269
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,548
That you were my sister's in-law,

270
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,425
and we live in the same house?

271
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,219
It wasn't like this at first, but now…

272
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,931
I don't know. My head hurts. I give up.

273
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,601
Won't they be sad
to find out secondhand later?

274
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,727
After all, you're friends.

275
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,020
No, we're not.

276
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,772
They don't really like me.

277
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,692
I don't think that's the case.

278
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,319
Not only them,

279
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,989
but I'm also worried people at work
will get the wrong idea.

280
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,534
I've always made mistakes,
and I keep making them.

281
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,038
I'm worried they'd say
it's because I'm too busy dating.

282
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,754
I'm always being criticized, so it's fine.

283
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,173
But I don't want it to hurt you…

284
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,094
Do-won.

285
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,806
Sorry?

286
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,309
What?

287
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,394
What?

288
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,437
It's your name.

289
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,105
Do-won.

290
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,320
Well, that is true. You're right. Yes.

291
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,237
"Yes"?

292
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,906
Don't say, "Yes."

293
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,658
Be casual and say, "Yeah."

294
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,664
It's still a bit…

295
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,917
At work, you go, "Hey, Yi-young,"
and have no trouble being casual.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,834
You're right.

297
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,628
Then…

298
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,130
Well…

299
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,507
Yi…

300
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,474
Oh Yi-young…

301
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,645
Dr. Oh. I can't do it!

302
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,650
Let's just go home, Do-won.

303
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,703
OH YI-YOUNG
WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?

304
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,665
KU DO-WON
SOUNDS GOOD

305
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,583
-Hey.
-What?

306
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,626
Are you seeing someone?

307
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,586
What?

308
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,881
No.

309
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,929
Yeah.

310
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:54,847
-What?
-What?

311
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,348
-What?
-Holy cow!

312
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,850
I knew it.

313
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,894
You've been staring at your phone all day.

314
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,022
Hey, either sit down properly or get lost.

315
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,148
Who is it?

316
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,026
Is it someone from work?

317
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,987
Oh, my. Did you know too, Do-won?

318
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,530
No. What?

319
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,033
There's no way he'd know.

320
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,659
He's not interested in such things.

321
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,577
Who is it?

322
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,579
Forget it. Whatever. Don't date.

323
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,913
-Why not?
-What?

324
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,044
Well, it obviously
sounds like a colleague.

325
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,714
If they break up in the end,
I'm just worried it'd cause a mess.

326
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,300
She's terribly fickle.

327
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,678
One minute she's in love,
the next minute she's not.

328
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,930
When was I ever like that?

329
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,308
And I've never dated anyone before.

330
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,893
This is my first love.

331
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,977
Oh, my God!

332
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,355
Won-woo, Sang-min,

333
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,900
and who else was it?

334
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,610
Was it Hoo-ni?

335
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,820
Or was it So-ni?

336
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,113
Anyway, don't you remember?

337
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,741
No, I've never heard of them before.

338
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,034
Who are they?

339
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:01,747
Anyway, don't be foolish with dating
and inconvenience your coworkers.

340
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,999
You have to see them
every day for four years.

341
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,877
Right. That's why they say
dating a coworker, a friend,

342
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,963
or someone with complicated ties
is a bad idea.

343
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,174
You and Joo-young were coworkers.

344
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,176
If you get married like us,
then it's okay.

345
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,928
We will.

346
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,096
Oh, my gosh!

347
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,891
What am I, a vegetable that needs water?

348
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,351
Gross.

349
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,353
But wait, what did you say?

350
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,396
What are you going to do? Get married?

351
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,439
You?

352
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,859
For goodness' sake.

353
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,987
Then show me.
I'll be at the hospital in a couple days.

354
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,405
Introduce us to him.

355
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,873
I was just joking.
It was to make you laugh.

356
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,458
For crying out loud.

357
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,629
Hey. If it was a joke,
why did you make it sound so serious?

358
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,797
Why are you so angry?

359
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,048
I'm not!

360
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
Don't treat me like those bean sprouts!

361
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,180
What's wrong with this one?

362
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,015
Give her some slack.

363
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,227
The day after tomorrow is
the third blood test, and she's nervous.

364
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,521
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

365
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,273
I'm not nervous at all.

366
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,944
Results of the first test were ambiguous,
so they did a second one.

367
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,238
They showed an ambiguous increase too.

368
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,324
They said the third test
should be at least double the second.

369
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,284
But I'm not sure.

370
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,287
Still, the pregnancy tests
consistently showed two lines.

371
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,039
It was like that during the third round
of IVF and still failed.

372
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,041
Don't get your hopes up.

373
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,501
Okay, I won't.

374
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,628
We're doing it one more time anyway.

375
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,464
So if it works, great.
If not, what can we do?

376
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,507
Right.

377
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,968
I almost forgot.
I can't make it to the hospital that day.

378
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,053
Can one of you come? Please?

379
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,555
I'll see if I can.

380
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,265
I'm surprised. You must be really busy.

381
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,393
He's been doing a research project
with nanoparticles,

382
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,937
and it reached deterministic
and statistical optimization.

383
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,315
What has done what?

384
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,858
They're called nanoparticles,

385
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,818
and their surface-modifying
polymer coating…

386
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,361
Look, you wouldn't know.

387
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,989
You know who started that research?

388
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,576
My predecessor and researcher,
Oh Joo-young.

389
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,245
Gosh, before I quit,

390
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,373
that was my prized research project.

391
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,170
And all this time,

392
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,756
what have I been doing?

393
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,303
No, what I mean is

394
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,931
my work's a part of it too,

395
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,557
so I want you to do your best with it.

396
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,393
Of course. Everything will work out
for the both of us.

397
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,939
I said not to get your hopes up.

398
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,940
Okay.

399
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,204
-I'll take it!
-I'll take it!

400
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,789
It's Prof. Seo's patient.

401
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,706
Hold on.

402
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,208
Professor Kong said--

403
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,210
Be quiet. You'll wake the babies.

404
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,299
I'm fine either way, so you two
come to an agreement and let me know.

405
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,970
Gosh, they're always bickering.

406
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,393
Ms. Na Hyo-jin. At 33-weeks
and in MFICU with preeclampsia.

407
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,645
Her BP had been stable,

408
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,065
but it rose to 150 this morning,
and she now has a headache.

409
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,858
She needs to deliver today.

410
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,987
Chae Yu-ra. At 33-weeks
and in MFICU with PPROM.

411
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,947
She developed a fever this morning.

412
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,449
She has to deliver today,
but EBW's only 1,900 g.

413
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,367
Really?

414
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,994
Our baby's 1,800 g.

415
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,996
It's smaller and more delicate.

416
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,331
Our patient might have chorioamnionitis.

417
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,166
Ours might develop preeclampsia.

418
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,626
Just transfer your patient.

419
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,919
-I said no.
-I can't either.

420
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,337
-This is Pediatrics.
-If I do,

421
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,922
-Kong wants me gone.
-Yes, I'm coming.

422
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,090
Then go!

423
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,136
-Wait, why?
-Where are you going?

424
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,305
Dr. Myeong's in delivery,
but the baby's not well.

425
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,015
Move.

426
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,643
Watch your feet.

427
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,109
Damn it, I just got robbed.

428
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,821
I'd like it if you could come and check.

429
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,575
My mom's IV is leaking again.

430
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,285
Okay, we'll check.

431
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,871
Thank you.

432
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,089
Wait, isn't that the guardian
who made a scene

433
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,841
for poking his mother twice with the IV?

434
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,009
Yes, that's him.

435
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,094
I'm surprised he said thank you.

436
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,139
Last time they were admitted,

437
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,976
the professor exploded at him
for calling me "lady."

438
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,563
After that, he's been kind.
It's just his tone.

439
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,440
-I'll go check.
-Okay.

440
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,528
Hey, what have you been doing?
The patient's burning up!

441
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,656
Is that…

442
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,701
It's POD 1, so we did a chest X-ray.

443
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,411
It looked fine, so we're observing them.

444
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,829
Even if that was fine,

445
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,665
if the patient keeps getting a fever,
you have to do something!

446
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,920
Blood and urine cultures
are taken on POD 2 and 3.

447
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,674
And the wound culture is done
on POD 4 and 5 if there's a fever.

448
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,262
I was going to check the wound
during the routine dressing tomorrow.

449
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,932
Hey, are you giving me a lecture?

450
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,142
-No.
-I told you.

451
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,062
Only tell me things I don't know.

452
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,981
Don't waste your breath
on things I already know!

453
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,984
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,114
I don't care what POD it is.
You have to find the source of the fever!

455
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,990
So what should you do?

456
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,662
You don't know?

457
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,663
I do.

458
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,081
Then why aren't you answering?

459
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,627
You said to only tell you things
you don't know…

460
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,381
Are you joking right now?

461
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,555
Whether it's a blood or urine culture
or a wound complication check,

462
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,641
get a fever workup
on the patient right now

463
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,560
and get that temperature down, okay?

464
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,186
Yes, Professor.

465
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,900
I bet you wouldn't have been
this sloppy if this was OB.

466
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,285
Why is he dragging OB into this?

467
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,327
I don't know.

468
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,455
Last time for a POD 1,
he complained I ran too many tests.

469
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,082
What does he want me to do?

470
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,337
I think you totally
got in his doghouse somehow.

471
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,631
Did you do something wrong?

472
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,550
Me?

473
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,136
No, nothing.

474
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,723
Sa-bi.

475
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,267
This is a method I often use.

476
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,645
If the professor's expression is

477
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,148
bad, like really serious.

478
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,193
Then beat them to the punch
and say, "I'm sorry!"

479
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,486
I did nothing wrong, so why apologize?

480
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,404
No reason.

481
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,865
Just pretend you made a mistake and do it.

482
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,491
But I didn't, so why pretend?

483
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,659
What I'm saying is…

484
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,497
Never mind.

485
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,333
You just do it your way.

486
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,669
I have a surgery to go to.

487
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,339
Try not to get yelled at while I'm gone.

488
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,510
Hey, I can't believe

489
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,888
I'm the one saying this to you.

490
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,370
By the way, Professor.

491
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,164
Why didn't you do open surgery
for this cancer case?

492
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,794
I'm not saying it was wrong.

493
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,129
I mean, it's a complicated procedure.

494
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,675
So I was curious about why you went
with a laparoscopic surgery instead.

495
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,552
I'm not trying to argue at all.
I just wanted to ask.

496
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,470
Honestly, sir.

497
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,059
I feel so moved right now.

498
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,271
A first-year asked me
a question during surgery.

499
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,605
This is a first.

500
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,698
Everyone just

501
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,450
assumes everything we do is right.

502
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,869
They think,
"The professor will take care of it."

503
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,664
No one is curious like this.

504
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,421
Studies show no difference
in patient outcomes

505
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,340
between laparoscopy and open surgery.

506
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,636
But in the case of this patient,

507
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,263
she's older.

508
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,056
So we are trying

509
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,226
to reduce the number of hours
in surgery as much as possible.

510
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,813
Does that answer your question…

511
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,148
Doctor…

512
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,566
Dr. Yoon Tae-jin?

513
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,192
It's Um Jae-il.

514
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,486
Yes, of course. Um Jae-il.

515
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,739
Of course, I know you.

516
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,782
I know about the…

517
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,826
Hi… Hi-Man.

518
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,411
It's HI-BOYZ.

519
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,204
Sorry.

520
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,168
Removing the specimen.

521
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,087
Gosh.

522
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,008
Look at this.

523
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,427
Why do things like these form?

524
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,305
They make people so upset

525
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,391
and suffer so much.

526
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,101
Goodness.

527
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,354
Anyway,

528
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,939
HI-BOYZ.

529
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,740
You're really not going?

530
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,118
Prof. Kong doesn't buy us pizza often.

531
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,079
And it's from a really good place.

532
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,541
I don't really like pizza that much.

533
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,044
You ate a whole pie last time…

534
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,800
I do like pizza, but today I think

535
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,468
I have indigestion.

536
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,511
Do you need medicine?

537
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,720
No!

538
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm fine.

539
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,808
I don't usually take drugs.

540
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,142
You go ahead.

541
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,268
We'll be right back then.

542
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,311
No!

543
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,479
No?

544
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,650
Take your time.

545
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,569
Eat a lot and make sure to chew carefully.

546
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,363
You might get indigestion.

547
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,866
-Okay. We'll be right back.
-Okay. We'll be back.

548
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,034
I can't wait!

549
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,970
You should've gone and eaten pizza.

550
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,432
I like this better.

551
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,377
Dr. Oh.

552
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,422
I'm very confused.

553
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,341
Do you want to keep this a secret
or tell everyone?

554
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,469
I don't know.

555
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,931
But I'm sure I want to be with you.

556
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,437
Me too.

557
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,080
I can't pick it up.

558
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,214
-Some meat too. Yeah.
-Meat?

559
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,717
And the spinach?

560
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,885
Spinach too?

561
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,184
I'm too tired to even lift my spoon.

562
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,186
I better help you.

563
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,521
No, Dr. Oh. No.

564
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,648
-I'm strong.
-Really, I'm fine though.

565
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,490
Geez, if you drop your chopsticks,

566
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,908
pick them up…

567
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,160
Dr. Myeong?

568
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,411
Hello.

569
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,329
Hi.

570
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,831
-Dr. Oh.
-Yes?

571
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,959
The surgery ahead of us is running long.
Bring her down 30 minutes later.

572
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,001
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,716
Hello, Professor.

574
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,053
Prof. Kong wrote
the letter of recommendation.

575
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,559
Professor applications are due next week,
so I wanted to make sure mine's in order.

576
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,020
Yes. Thank you. Bye.

577
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,236
Hey, Dr. Ku?

578
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,071
By any chance,

579
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,116
have you heard how many applied
for the professor position this time?

580
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,576
No.

581
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,412
I heard Dr. Yoo Jeong-hye applied.

582
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,038
Oh, her?

583
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,209
By the way, your lunch box…

584
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,214
Enjoy your food.

585
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,799
See you later.

586
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,717
Goodbye, ma'am.

587
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,975
Gosh, that scared me.

588
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,022
This darn hospital is so huge,
but there's nowhere for us to date.

589
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,899
Because dates are usually done outside.

590
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,817
The only places we go are here and home.

591
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,027
So when, where, and how?

592
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,780
And at home,
we have two sets of eyes on us.

593
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,449
Right.

594
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,118
I have to work this weekend too.

595
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,244
Damn it.

596
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,456
Then want to meet
at the emergency stairs later?

597
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,498
It's quiet there.

598
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,459
All the floors are already full.

599
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,586
Geez, don't they do any work?

600
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,214
Then the elevator?

601
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,885
You've seen too many movies.
That won't work.

602
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,345
Then where?

603
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,057
I have about 30 minutes after 9:00 p.m.

604
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,433
Let's have some coffee there.

605
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,685
-I'm sure it's empty.
-Where?

606
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,520
It's--

607
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,732
PYO NAM-KYUNG

608
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,151
Damn it, she has awful timing.

609
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,403
What?

610
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,244
Ma'am, your cervical length looks good.
Everything's fine.

611
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,538
You can go up to the ward now.

612
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,998
Okay, thank you.

613
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,417
I have to start
outpatient ultrasounds now, so move.

614
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,002
Just one more. I swear, last one.

615
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,129
No. Can't you see
all the patients outside?

616
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,631
-I'll be quick.
-I said no.

617
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,258
If they're ward patients,
use the portable ultrasound there.

618
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,593
Why are you down here?

619
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,762
Prof. Kong said to do
official sonographies.

620
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,097
Look, I don't care.

621
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,267
I'm sorry.

622
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,436
Come on out.

623
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,737
If ultrasounds run late,
we'll be backed up.

624
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,739
Look, I know.

625
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,493
But Kong had urgent decisions to make
and wanted dopplers done here too.

626
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,828
So what am I supposed to do?

627
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,873
It's nothing.

628
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,126
If you take a seat here for a moment,

629
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,419
I'll come get you soon.

630
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,295
Okay.

631
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,008
You should come during lunch
when we're on break.

632
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,926
I told you several times I just heard too.

633
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,304
Please, just this once.

634
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,265
I have to do this fast and go back up.

635
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,516
Damn it.

636
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,351
Then hurry.

637
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,062
Yes, Professor?

638
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,023
Have you done Ms. Moon's ultrasound yet?

639
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,899
Why isn't she here for her appointment?

640
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,318
I'm sorry.
Ultrasounds are a bit backed up.

641
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,154
I'll do it now and send her to you.

642
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:55,116
Yi-young, outpatient care's been held up
by ultrasounds all morning.

643
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,492
So? Do you need me to come?

644
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,952
No, I'm sorry!

645
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,996
I'll be quick!

646
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,086
Hello, Professor.

647
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,714
Yes, I checked everyone.

648
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,508
But there's one patient
I don't think we can…

649
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,929
No, I can do it. Yes.

650
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,931
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:19,974
Bye.

652
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,187
Yi-young, just this once!

653
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,314
Hello.

654
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,565
-Hello.
-Hello.

655
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,567
-Hello.
-Hello.

656
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,486
Hello!

657
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,739
Look at those bumbling fools.

658
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,617
If they prepared beforehand,
they wouldn't need to run.

659
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,874
What are you doing?

660
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,584
That's hot!

661
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
Ms. Jeon's surgery
is the first one for tomorrow.

662
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,311
Did you know it's a colostomy
for bowel obstruction?

663
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,230
-Yes, I know.
-Then tell me.

664
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,732
Why is there porridge
when she should be fasting?

665
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,943
Did you want the surgery to be ruined?

666
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,028
Well…

667
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,532
I personally asked
the chief of Surgery for this one.

668
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,701
If this gets canceled,
how would that make me look?

669
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,622
It's a co-op…

670
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,999
A surgical consult--

671
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:27,917
And?

672
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,128
So what?

673
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,921
The order

674
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,757
by the Surgery resident…

675
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,800
What about them?

676
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,802
What?!

677
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,596
I'm sorry.

678
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,934
Hey, are you here
to save lives or to take them?

679
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,146
Thank God I did my rounds then.

680
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,355
But what if I hadn't?

681
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,232
Professor Jo.

682
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,651
Hello, Chief.

683
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,736
Why aren't you picking up?

684
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,740
I'm so sorry. I was just…

685
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,743
Because of my resident…
But is something the matter?

686
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,287
Yeah, I…

687
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,664
Apparently, my resident made a mistake.

688
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,460
He confused the patients
and ordered meals for Ms. Jeon.

689
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,046
Right, the meals…

690
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,508
You mean the porridge, right?

691
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,302
Yeah, the porridge.

692
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,220
Did she eat it already?

693
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,598
-No, she hasn't.
-Goodness.

694
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,141
There's no need to worry about that.

695
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,018
I double-check everything.

696
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,102
That's a relief.

697
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,021
And you…

698
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,523
I'm sorry.

699
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,777
I'm sorry.

700
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,947
It's all right.
Things like that happen often.

701
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,449
It's okay.

702
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,659
Just be careful from now on.

703
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,496
Chief, since you're here,
how about we have some tea?

704
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,623
Should we then?

705
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,707
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

706
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,708
You can go back.

707
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,901
Why didn't you tell him?

708
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,488
"I didn't do that."

709
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,699
I was scared.

710
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,454
He was in the wrong.

711
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,040
You did nothing wrong, Dr. Kim.

712
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,291
So chin up.

713
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,920
Yes, sir.

714
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:36,921
Hang in there.

715
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,215
You can do…

716
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,552
I shouldn't just say such things.

717
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,057
I should be of some help.

718
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,226
It's okay. Thank you.

719
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,938
I'll put in the prescriptions.

720
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,274
Go get yourself a coffee.

721
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,942
It's okay, sir.

722
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,026
No, no.

723
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,404
Go. I want a coffee too.

724
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,030
Hurry up. Go!

725
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,740
Get up! Hurry!

726
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,658
Come on.

727
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,244
Go and get me a…

728
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,497
You know. An iced Americano this big.

729
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,957
You know, right?

730
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,420
Let's see.

731
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,671
What have we got here?

732
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,856
Aren't you hungry?

733
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,738
What about you?

734
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,160
What? Is something in your coffee?
Does it taste weird?

735
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,077
No.

736
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,877
The cafeteria has
spicy stir-fried pork today.

737
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,961
Really? Okay.

738
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,505
Hey, Jae-il. Today's bunsik day.

739
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,882
Ask her if she wants that.

740
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,216
Ask who?

741
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,552
Jae-il, I had bunsik yesterday.

742
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,636
I had pork yesterday.

743
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,016
Then, tonight--

744
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,184
-Spicy pork.
-Bunsik.

745
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,230
You two figure it out.
Don't put me in the middle.

746
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,316
Did you two fight?

747
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,525
-No!
-No!

748
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,860
You did.

749
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,278
Why would I? I have no reason to.

750
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,822
Yeah, I have no reason to fight with her.

751
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,241
But she gets me scolded a lot.

752
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,201
You're one to talk.

753
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,579
Sa-bi, if a patient in the ward
needs urgent care,

754
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:37,166
is it that big of a deal to check her
before outpatient ultrasounds?

755
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:41,045
Jae-il, can you believe some people
still don't get the outpatient process?

756
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,926
I just wanted to have dinner.

757
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,472
Forget it.

758
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,558
Let's not eat and just starve together!

759
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,436
Hey! Don't drink that!

760
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,105
Professor Ryu bought it for me!

761
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,065
I'm sorry!

762
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,361
Seriously, you…

763
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,737
Do you have to take it this far?

764
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,906
It's not even a big deal!

765
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,409
Damn it. I'm leaving.

766
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,704
No one better stop me. I'm going for real!

767
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,373
Damn it!

768
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,893
You did great.

769
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,770
We'll call you with the results.

770
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,564
It'll take about an hour.

771
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,775
I'm done with blood tests now, right?

772
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,110
That was the last one?

773
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,403
Probably so.

774
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,529
Then,

775
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,948
for next time…

776
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,202
If the results are good,
we'll do an ultrasound next week.

777
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,539
That's when you look at images
of the womb, right?

778
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,582
Yes.

779
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,004
And an hour would mean
a call at around 1:30 p.m.?

780
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,339
We'll call you
as soon as we get the results.

781
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,592
All right. Thank you.

782
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,235
Dr. Oh, we have
many new patients tomorrow.

783
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,238
Are you going to delay
the outpatient ultrasounds again?

784
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,156
Yes, ma'am.

785
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,867
I mean, I won't.

786
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,661
If ultrasounds are delayed,
that's a ton of complaints.

787
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,579
Dr. Pyo.

788
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,582
I have 25 outpatients
who need ultrasounds tomorrow, right?

789
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,583
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,710
I need to be done
with my appointments by 5:00 p.m.

791
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,504
There can't be any delays. Got it?

792
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,963
I'll check as quickly as possible.

793
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,259
And a room's opening up in the OB ward.

794
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,886
I need that one.

795
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,056
That's what I was going to say.

796
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,182
I need it.

797
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,351
My patient in GYN ward needs to go there.

798
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,977
It makes doing rounds difficult.

799
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,771
You get what I mean, Dr. Pyo?

800
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,813
Yes, ma'am.

801
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,066
That's what I meant.

802
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,985
My patient's in the GYN ward too.
I'm counting on you.

803
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,695
And make sure to eat.

804
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,197
Yes, ma'am.

805
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,825
Hello, Administration?

806
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,744
I'm Dr. Pyo Nam-kyung from OB-GYN.

807
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,038
I heard there's a room open
in the OB ward.

808
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,122
Hey!

809
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,959
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25

810
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,640
Sorry, I had work.

811
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,563
Don't pretend to be nice.

812
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,730
It's weird.

813
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,317
They haven't called yet?

814
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,986
No.

815
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,078
Are you nervous?

816
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,122
No.

817
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,627
If it worked, it would've been
at the first blood test.

818
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,547
I'm not getting my hopes up.

819
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,759
Hello?

820
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,094
Yes, this is Oh Joo-young.

821
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,976
I see.

822
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,812
Thank you.

823
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,689
Goodbye.

824
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,413
What was it at?

825
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,456
They said 91.

826
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,001
It was 153 during the second test.
It's even lower.

827
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,837
A chemical miscarriage?

828
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,131
How did you know?

829
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,136
Right, you're a doctor.

830
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,265
How can you laugh now?

831
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,811
Maybe it's because I wasn't hopeful.

832
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,023
I don't feel as bad as I thought I would.

833
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,653
I'm fine.

834
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,239
It's not like I heard
its heartbeat or felt a kick.

835
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,909
It just means a cell's gone.

836
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,538
And I still have two embryos left.

837
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,999
It's okay. I can try again.

838
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,135
Eat before you go. I have a bit of time.

839
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,305
You're busy. We'll skip food.

840
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,432
Just buy me a coffee.

841
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,770
I couldn't have coffee because of the IVF.

842
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,481
I could use a nice, cold one.

843
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,443
Let's go then.

844
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,286
And you?

845
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,622
Iced Americano.

846
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,960
One iced Americano
and one iced latte, please.

847
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,170
And make the latte decaf…

848
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,511
Never mind.

849
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,851
It already became a habit.

850
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,151
It was all for nothing.

851
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,903
And I tried so hard.

852
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,881
Come on, now.

853
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,264
I'm sorry. One iced Americano and…

854
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,276
an iced latte with an extra shot.

855
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,862
With a lot of caffeine, please.

856
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:22,779
Sure.

857
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,470
PROF. JO JOON-MO

858
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,441
Hello, Professor.

859
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,194
Sa-bi went to the bathroom.

860
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,364
I'll check and get right back to you.

861
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,199
Goodbye.

862
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,994
It was nothing.

863
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,288
He wanted you to check the OR schedule.

864
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,835
Did you eat?

865
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,797
You should be at the cafeteria.

866
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,341
What? Were you afraid
of running into the professor?

867
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,554
Why are you here?

868
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,305
Why else would I come to a bank?

869
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,306
To withdraw money.

870
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,148
They're closing now. Let's go.

871
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,567
Okay.

872
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,781
If you want to be alone,
come here during the day.

873
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,576
And go there at night.

874
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,579
Where?

875
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,289
There's a place where no one goes.

876
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,291
It's quiet.

877
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,799
Don't laugh. Be quiet!

878
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,635
Excuse me.

879
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,305
I'll look at him. He's a friend.

880
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,764
Sure.

881
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,766
-Thank you.
-No problem.

882
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,692
Do you know how hard it was
just to get here?

883
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,527
Please help me.

884
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,737
All right.

885
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,947
I'll help, so stop pleading.

886
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,116
We're friends,
so there's no need for that.

887
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,327
I said don't laugh.

888
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,870
Gosh, this is driving me insane.

889
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,712
I mean, how on earth
does this even happen?

890
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,380
There was super glue on the table.

891
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,300
But I accidentally put my elbow on it.
So what happens?

892
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,010
-The glue would come out, right?
-Yeah.

893
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,429
I caught it quickly with my hands
so it wouldn't drip.

894
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,513
And I ended up like this.

895
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,724
If these hands are ruined,
you're out of a job.

896
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,017
You'll be unemployed.

897
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,895
I know, Jung-min. So please.

898
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,440
Amen, namaste, sawasdee krub. Seriously.

899
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,486
It's in this pocket.

900
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,112
My goodness.

901
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,786
It's not working. Face recognition.

902
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,622
Okay. Wait.

903
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,960
Darn it.

904
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,128
For crying out loud…

905
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,255
Damn typo.

906
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,719
I did it!

907
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,096
-My goodness.
-Now, put it back.

908
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,559
Let me see.

909
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,770
But is an obstetrician right for this?

910
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,271
Of course.

911
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,150
Right, we have a specialist for this.

912
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,485
They're at our hospital now.

913
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,778
Which department? Dermatology?

914
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,154
Orthopedics? OEM?

915
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,155
Not those.

916
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,366
No, why can't you just do it instead?

917
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,742
I'll assist you.

918
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,202
Professor, please operate.

919
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,413
If you get in trouble,
you should go to your hospital.

920
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,872
Why come here and make a fuss?

921
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,582
This is closer to my house.

922
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,918
We'll say that
and not because you were embarrassed.

923
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,548
The specialist is here.

924
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,383
Who is it? Do I know them?

925
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,053
She's the best for this.
An eminent physician.

926
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:16,471
Lee Ik-jun?

927
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,017
Weren't we meeting at the campsite?
Why are you here?

928
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,397
And what's with your hands?

929
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,524
What did you do?

930
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,154
The glue…

931
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,906
I got it on my hands.

932
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,283
How?

933
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,119
You know your favorite camping lantern?

934
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,246
The handle fell off,
so I was reattaching it…

935
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,248
For goodness' sake!

936
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,542
I told you to leave it.

937
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,252
Let me see. Does it hurt a lot?

938
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,880
What are we going to do with your hands?

939
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,466
But why are you here, Song-hwa?

940
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,176
I told you I was revising a paper today.

941
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,596
Chi-hong was taking a while with the data,
so I came to help.

942
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,431
How did you know Song-hwa was here?

943
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:03,852
She told me she was coming by,
so we had lunch and went up to the lab.

944
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,812
Then I got the call
that you were in the ER.

945
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,274
Jung-min, what should we do?

946
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,153
Let's try warm saline first.

947
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,906
If it doesn't work,
we'll call Orthopedics and cut them off.

948
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,365
Hey. Geez.

949
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,494
You sure have a lot on your hands.

950
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,412
Ik-jun.

951
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,663
Who's that?

952
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,831
Ik-jun!

953
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,125
Ik-jun!

954
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,711
Oh, my gosh. What happened?

955
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,214
Jung-min said you were in the ER.

956
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,341
I was so scared.

957
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,930
She just happened
to be in the lab when they called.

958
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,478
How have you been,

959
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:47,938
Jun?

960
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,397
Good, of course.

961
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,943
Are you okay?

962
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,152
How did this happen?

963
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,487
Well, I was…

964
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,030
Hey.

965
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,282
Do you only see one person here?

966
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:00,867
Oh, my gosh! Song-hwa!

967
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,786
It's been so long!

968
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,788
How are you?

969
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,749
You've become even prettier.

970
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,084
Oh, stop.

971
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,337
Right? She gets prettier every day.

972
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,130
It's been forever, Gi-sun.

973
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,883
You haven't changed in three years.

974
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,345
Yeah, her looks and her skills
are exactly the same.

975
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,433
Song-hwa, look. This is driving me crazy.

976
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,477
-It stings.
-Does it sting a lot?

977
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,062
It does more than sting.

978
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:29,980
Wait, your hair.

979
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,731
Geez!

980
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,775
Stop worrying about me
and worry about yourself.

981
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,694
What do we do?

982
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,572
-Don't try to force them apart.
-I won't.

983
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,489
What's going on?

984
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,449
You didn't know?

985
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,494
Your first love
is with Song-hwa as his last love.

986
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,079
It's been a while.

987
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,497
You didn't know?

988
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,124
Stop messing around.

989
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,584
Is that why…

990
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,671
No, I knew too, okay?

991
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,214
For now, you're banned from camping.

992
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,549
Here?

993
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,508
That hurts!

994
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,427
Maybe wipe the lipstick
off your teeth first.

995
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,720
This won't work.

996
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,890
Damn it!

997
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,394
I won.

998
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,770
-I won.
-Hey!

999
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,272
That's cheating if you hit like--

1000
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,523
What? Oh, right.

1001
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,194
-Did I hit too hard?
-No, it's fine.

1002
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,738
-I asked you to unstick them.
-Sorry.

1003
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,158
My goodness.

1004
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:29,331
If the preceding surgery runs long,
and you think mine will be delayed,

1005
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,000
you need to look for another OR yourself.

1006
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,755
If you can't even do that,
why are you here?

1007
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,964
What are you being paid for?

1008
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,300
What?

1009
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,637
Are you not interested
because it's not OB?

1010
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,930
Excuse me.

1011
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,724
Or do you not need to do well
because it's not OB?

1012
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,476
You're not an OB-GYN.

1013
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,978
I see. You're only here for OB, right?

1014
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,396
Chief!

1015
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,323
If you're going to scold her,
please stick to the OR issue.

1016
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,407
I think you can leave out

1017
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,620
all the other useless comments.

1018
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,622
Hold on.

1019
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,416
Professor Ryu, who are you talking to--

1020
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,501
Professor!

1021
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,424
I'm talking to you, Professor.

1022
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,512
If they make a mistake,

1023
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,931
of course you should scold them.

1024
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:28,932
But…

1025
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,061
The location and content of the reprimand

1026
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,189
still requires common courtesy.

1027
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,531
Professor Ryu,

1028
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,118
you're the one
without common courtesy right now.

1029
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,590
I mean, there's a reason
why I do this. Okay?

1030
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,176
I'm giving them
training and discipline, man!

1031
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,387
Who are you calling "man"?

1032
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,264
Also,

1033
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,101
asking questions like
why she's getting paid

1034
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,229
or assuming it's because it isn't OB

1035
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,107
isn't training or discipline at all!

1036
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,237
Dr. Kim Sa-bi

1037
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,907
already understands what she did wrong.

1038
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,076
I'm sure she does, right?

1039
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,873
That's enough, Professor.

1040
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,132
Fine.

1041
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,718
I was going to stop anyway.

1042
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,803
But why are you getting all upset?

1043
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,055
You're spoiling the mood.

1044
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:50,972
Goodness.

1045
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,390
Okay, I'm sorry.

1046
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,267
All right? I'm sorry.

1047
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,518
There's nothing to see here.

1048
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,604
You can get back to work, okay?

1049
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:10,950
Dr. Kim.

1050
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:13,870
Did you

1051
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,289
get an apology?

1052
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,835
I forgot to ask for that.

1053
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,463
Professor!

1054
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,717
He did.

1055
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,762
I think I heard an apology.

1056
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,514
Thank you.

1057
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,185
That's a relief then.

1058
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,200
I can't believe he did that
to a senior doctor.

1059
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,493
And in front of the juniors?

1060
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,245
What the hell?

1061
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,583
My apologies.

1062
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,212
You're not hurt, are you?
I'm a professor here.

1063
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,380
So?

1064
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,843
There's a lot of sick people here.
You should be more careful.

1065
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,637
Right. I'm sorry.

1066
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,986
I… I didn't swear.

1067
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:36,035
I don't yell in the hospital anymore
or talk informally to anyone.

1068
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,912
That's very good.

1069
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,999
It's so nice
to see you smiling around here.

1070
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,545
When you smile,
you show off an adorable side.

1071
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,754
-Me?
-Yes.

1072
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,132
Where were you coming from?

1073
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,341
From the ward.

1074
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,844
Your mother's improved greatly.

1075
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,304
Her lab results are good too.

1076
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,222
It's thanks to you.

1077
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,767
No, she's gotten better
because you're smiling now.

1078
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,020
All right, then.

1079
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,732
Keep on smiling.

1080
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,649
Yes, sir.

1081
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,443
-Goodbye, sir!
-Bye.

1082
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,737
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1083
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:24,876
OB-GYN, OH JOO-YOUNG

1084
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,382
Pyo Nam-kyung!

1085
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,177
-Yes?
-And Oh Yi-young.

1086
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,764
Are you in a contest to see who's worse?

1087
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,891
Both of you are behind on charting.

1088
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,934
Yi-young.

1089
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,311
Birth certificates, delivery discharges,

1090
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,021
and tomorrow's discharge notes.

1091
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,272
You haven't done any of them.

1092
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,527
And Nam-kyung, you didn't write
admission notes for next week's surgeries.

1093
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,154
When are you going to
assess patients in advance?

1094
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,781
I'm sorry.

1095
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,282
I'm going in for surgery.

1096
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,952
Get that all done while I'm gone
and show me before going home.

1097
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,869
All right?

1098
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,121
I'm going to check everything.

1099
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,082
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1100
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,053
Hello?

1101
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:19,847
What?

1102
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,393
Yes, I'll tell the professor right away.
Okay, bye.

1103
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,610
Ma'am, please wake up.

1104
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,528
Ma'am?

1105
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,071
Hemoglobin's 6.6.

1106
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,406
And her BP's dropping.

1107
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,241
-Squeeze the blood harder.
-Yes, sir.

1108
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,201
Ma'am? Open your eyes.

1109
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,496
Ma'am, what's your name? Ma'am.

1110
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,457
Yulje EMS HL9697.

1111
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,168
Six mile final, Yulje helipad.

1112
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,296
CENTRAL EMC

1113
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,718
Ma'am!

1114
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,220
-We're moving.
-Lift her!

1115
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,680
-One, two, three!
-We're moving.

1116
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,100
One, two, three!

1117
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,979
She delivered via precipitous labor
two hours ago.

1118
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,857
We did a balloon tamponade for PPH,
but she keeps bleeding.

1119
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,692
BP dropped to 70 over 40.

1120
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,735
Now it's 90 over 60.

1121
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,945
First unit given was universal O.

1122
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,281
She had DDLT surgery seven years ago.

1123
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,326
Ma'am! Please wake up! Ma'am!

1124
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,620
Let's get her to the ER
and secure a line first.

1125
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,038
Then take her up to the OR.

1126
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,418
Connect the monitors and check her vitals.

1127
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,086
-Yes, sir.
-Please bring the ultrasound.

1128
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,004
Yes, Doctor.

1129
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,718
-Placing a central line.
-Okay.

1130
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,224
Pyo Nam-kyung!

1131
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,269
Pyo Nam-kyung!

1132
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,147
Hey, Nam-kyung!

1133
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,608
Yi-young.

1134
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,735
We have to quickly…

1135
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,612
I don't think I can do it.

1136
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,113
I don't know.

1137
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,531
There's no time for that.

1138
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,617
She's bleeding!

1139
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,745
Hey!

1140
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,829
I said she's bleeding.

1141
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,289
Right.

1142
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,876
If there's bleeding, quickly recognize it…

1143
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,670
Quickly…

1144
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:14,921
-Place the line.
-Okay.

1145
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,882
I did the SPEED CP, so…

1146
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,551
TIME-SENSITIVE PROTOCOL FOR MANAGING PPH

1147
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,180
Nurse, please insert the Foley.

1148
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,307
Then…

1149
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,644
Right, mix oxytocin into the fluids.

1150
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,021
-And give an IV push of carbetocin.
-Yes, Doctor.

1151
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,691
-Are the labs on their way?
-Yes, they are.

1152
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,072
Doctor, please set up
the rapid infusion system.

1153
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,281
Okay.

1154
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,284
-Give the fluids at full drip.
-Yes, Doctor.

1155
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,285
It's open.

1156
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,203
Nam-kyung.

1157
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,958
Get it together!

1158
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,462
I'm scared too!

1159
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,175
Right.

1160
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,970
Remove the balloon first.

1161
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,024
The OR.

1162
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,244
This is OB. Is the OR ready?

1163
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,413
Please hurry! It's urgent!

1164
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:33,916
-Nurse.
-Yes?

1165
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,084
I called the blood bank.

1166
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,587
Get two packs of universal O first

1167
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,589
-and send it straight to the OR.
-Yes, Doctor!

1168
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:40,631
-Hurry!
-Okay!

1169
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,634
Doctor, please place an A-line as well.

1170
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,594
Okay.

1171
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:51,184
EMERGENCY MEDICINE

1172
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:57,899
-Doctor.
-Yes?

1173
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,734
The patient has a history of DDLT.

1174
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,527
-What?
-Oh, right.

1175
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:05,448
We'll need the liver transplant team
to help check the lab results,

1176
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,699
but they're not here.

1177
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,369
Give it to me. I'll take a look.

1178
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,704
Here.

1179
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,082
I'm an HPB surgeon from Songdo Yulje.

1180
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,459
I'll take a look.

1181
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,504
How long ago did she have the transplant?

1182
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,380
It's been seven years.

1183
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,965
And she gave birth two years ago.

1184
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,301
Her liver enzymes are normal.

1185
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:29,514
Use antibiotics general patients get,
and she can go in for surgery now.

1186
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,600
There might be some adhesion,
so be careful.

1187
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,518
Quickly, now.

1188
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,603
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1189
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,271
Moving her now.

1190
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,152
Bed coming through! Please make way!

1191
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,161
Ma'am, please wake up!

1192
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,329
Please!

1193
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,039
I'm so sleepy.

1194
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,999
No, you can't sleep! Open your eyes!

1195
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,252
Ma'am!

1196
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,545
Ma'am!

1197
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,421
It's your baby's birthday today!

1198
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,508
So the baby's waiting for its mom.

1199
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,592
We have to go to it.

1200
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,177
Right.

1201
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,523
-Anesthesia, please.
-Yes, Doctor.

1202
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,655
The patient's a multi, right?

1203
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,865
Yes, she is.

1204
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,533
She delivered two and a half hours ago.

1205
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,701
They said the baby's fine.

1206
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,702
Bleeding volume?

1207
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:35,371
I think it's been
about 2,000 cc until now.

1208
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,791
The speculum exam in the ER
showed active bleeding.

1209
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,251
How much blood did she get?

1210
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,880
She got one unit in the helicopter,
so a total of three so far.

1211
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,298
We got two universal O units,

1212
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,799
and we prepped ten RBC

1213
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,801
and five units of FFP from the bank.

1214
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:50,761
When will they be ready?

1215
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,180
It'll take about 20 minutes.

1216
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,892
Are the CBC and DIC labs back?

1217
01:04:55,975 --> 01:05:00,521
Yes, labs sent from the ER show
CBC 6.2, and platelets 90,000.

1218
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,815
OTPT is normal.

1219
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,150
And they say PT and aPTT

1220
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,986
seem to be prolonged.

1221
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,114
The other DIC labs are still in progress.

1222
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,866
Good job. You did very well!

1223
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,076
Dr. Pyo, scrub in first!

1224
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,538
I can't.

1225
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,415
Then, Yi-young!

1226
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,878
You're both assisting! Get it together!

1227
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,046
The patient's--

1228
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,213
Move aside, guys.

1229
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,715
What about your surgery?

1230
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:28,799
It's over.

1231
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,552
Professor, the patient…

1232
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,679
I know. I'm looking at her right now.

1233
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,064
Hey, we have no one assisting today.

1234
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,398
It appears we don't.

1235
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,442
All we can count on is our team.

1236
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,155
BP's dropping! It's 70 over 40!

1237
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,866
We'll keep up with the volume,
so don't worry and start.

1238
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,287
Yes, we'll begin now.

1239
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,553
ANESTHESIA TIME, SURGERY TIME

1240
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,142
Kelly.

1241
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,231
-One more Kelly.
-Yes, ma'am.

1242
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,067
Metzenbaum.

1243
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,736
Prepare the 1-0 suture tie.

1244
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,244
Tie.

1245
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,002
Cut.

1246
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,799
Tranexamic acid, please.

1247
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:52,883
Yes, Professor.

1248
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,063
Tonsil.

1249
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,693
Right angle.

1250
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,159
Hold the suction!

1251
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,368
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1252
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:46,353
I was worried about severe adhesions
from the transplant,

1253
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,688
but things went smoothly.

1254
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,732
I know. It's a relief.

1255
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,111
What do you think?

1256
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,114
She's not bleeding.

1257
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,115
And?

1258
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:00,993
The patient's…

1259
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,081
alive.

1260
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,540
The patient

1261
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,543
can meet her baby.

1262
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:11,754
No, not that!

1263
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:16,342
Blood loss was 4,000 cc,
but her vitals are stable.

1264
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,304
Yes, that's right. It's stable.

1265
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,140
The operation went really well.

1266
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:48,833
Hey.

1267
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:49,917
What?

1268
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,669
Draft the surgery notes.

1269
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,963
Why me? Ask the juniors.

1270
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,215
They won't remember anything.

1271
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,884
I barely managed to rouse them
to come to their senses.

1272
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,678
Then you write it!

1273
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,263
You were there first.

1274
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,140
The assistant is supposed to write it!

1275
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:05,808
I was the lead surgeon.

1276
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:09,645
I was in such shock
that everything was a blur.

1277
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,356
Hey, you've been doing this too long
to still get shocked.

1278
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,984
PPH is nothing new.

1279
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:15,985
What about you?

1280
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,155
Hey, I realized it when I saw your hands.

1281
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:22,366
"So that's what it means
to shake like a leaf."

1282
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:27,121
If my hands were shaking,
my sutures wouldn't be so perfect.

1283
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,081
Perfect? Yeah, right.

1284
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,082
Hey, you two.

1285
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,086
Don't you think that's enough?

1286
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,173
All you have to say is,
"Thanks. Nice work."

1287
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,508
"You did great."

1288
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:43,053
But instead, you've been fighting
and arguing for 20 years.

1289
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,054
Gosh.

1290
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,556
Gosh, I'm so sick of it.

1291
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,766
I'm so tired of you two!

1292
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:49,727
Gosh.

1293
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,777
Nice work. Good job. Thanks. Happy?

1294
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,654
Don't be ridiculous.

1295
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,573
Gosh, I'm so sick of it.

1296
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,451
Geez, those two.

1297
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:06,869
Professor!

1298
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,580
Oh, dear. Their surgery's over.

1299
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,789
Sorry?

1300
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,708
The emergency OB surgery.

1301
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,501
It went well.

1302
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,717
Where are you going? Not going home?

1303
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:26,055
I'm coming into your surgery.

1304
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,516
It's laparoscopic.
Someone needs to control the manipulator.

1305
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,437
I was going to put it in place first.

1306
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,064
The fellow's running late.

1307
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,774
That's what I was going to do.

1308
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,776
I already told the fellow as well.

1309
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,280
It's all right. Go home.

1310
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:44,865
You had a long day.

1311
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,494
It's okay. Go.

1312
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,621
It's fine. I can do it fine alone too.

1313
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,253
But really, I'm fine.

1314
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,299
I'm fine too.

1315
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,801
I'd like to see you operate.

1316
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,596
Really?

1317
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,555
Is that so?

1318
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,849
Then do you want to try an RSO?
What do you think?

1319
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,643
Yes! Thank you!

1320
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:13,727
Really?

1321
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,646
Then we should…

1322
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,731
Yes, Professor. The patient's stable.

1323
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,901
I updated the air emergency team

1324
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,528
and thanked them as well.

1325
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,282
Yes, I'll monitor her closely.

1326
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:28,993
Okay, bye.

1327
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:43,340
Are you done?

1328
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,926
Can we have some more time?

1329
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,971
Doctor, it's not that we didn't do them.
We couldn't.

1330
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:49,930
Today, there was--

1331
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:50,848
I know.

1332
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,352
The patient asked me
to thank her doctors for her.

1333
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,022
The doctor who first spoke to her
when she landed

1334
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,482
and the doctor who mentioned
her baby's birthday party.

1335
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:01,400
That was you, right?

1336
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,531
You did a really great job today.

1337
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:11,327
I'm sure it was very scary,
difficult, and chaotic.

1338
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:17,249
So as a way to say you did well…

1339
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,463
I'll do the rest.

1340
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:23,380
What?

1341
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,053
No? Then, go ahead.

1342
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,721
No, that's not it.

1343
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,101
I'll count to three.
Go before I change my mind.

1344
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,645
One…

1345
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,608
-Bye!
-Thank you!

1346
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,118
See you there in two hours.

1347
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,291
Aren't you hungry?
You haven't eaten all day.

1348
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,542
Don't talk to me.

1349
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,044
I'm so hungry I can't even walk.

1350
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:02,961
Really?

1351
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,923
Do you want this then?
A nurse gave it to me.

1352
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,383
Here.

1353
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:11,929
There are only two.

1354
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,972
I bet the others haven't eaten either.

1355
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:15,891
Should we just…

1356
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,353
eat these ourselves before we go?

1357
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,815
Isn't that a bit selfish?

1358
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,691
These are really famous.

1359
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,361
They sell out daily,
and you have to wait in line.

1360
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,405
Still…

1361
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,573
Did you see them fight yesterday?

1362
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,491
Yeah.

1363
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,826
We have to leave them alone.

1364
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,203
They'll be too embarrassed
to make up with us there.

1365
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,790
Giving them space is to help them.

1366
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:41,625
Really?

1367
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:43,961
Then…

1368
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:46,505
Should we?

1369
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,174
Where should we eat?

1370
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,427
Let's go there.

1371
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,512
Oh, there?

1372
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:54,430
Yeah.

1373
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,140
I'm sure no one's there now. Let's go.

1374
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,648
I haven't been here in so long. Gosh.

1375
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:05,983
Maybe this isn't the way?

1376
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:06,984
Yeah, it is.

1377
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,821
If we turn left there and go straight,
there are escalators.

1378
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,573
We can take those down to the lobby.

1379
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,660
Song-hwa, how do you know everything?

1380
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,163
It says right there.

1381
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,249
I didn't see it.

1382
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,084
I was to busy looking at you.

1383
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,754
But you know,

1384
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,299
it's a bit scary
being on the outpatient floor at night.

1385
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,050
It's empty.

1386
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:33,594
No.

1387
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:35,429
There are people here.

1388
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:38,724
Who?

1389
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,439
There's no one here.
What are you talking about?

1390
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,316
Hey, don't do that!

1391
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:48,567
It's not scary.

1392
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:52,070
I'm sure there are roaches here.

1393
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,155
Roaches?

1394
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,574
Hospitals don't have roaches. No way.

1395
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,159
No, not real roaches.

1396
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,995
Dating roaches.

1397
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:03,707
They have no time

1398
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,375
and nowhere to meet.

1399
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,585
But they still need to date.

1400
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:10,756
So they only look
for empty places in the hospital.

1401
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,342
So where do they all go?

1402
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,303
The emergency stairs? On-call rooms?

1403
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,014
Gosh, only if you want to get caught.

1404
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:20,474
Then where?

1405
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:22,768
Here?

1406
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,438
Exactly!

1407
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,816
There are no appointments,
patients, or staff here at night.

1408
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,196
So they secretly have dates here.

1409
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:37,366
But sometimes, professors come
to get things they left behind.

1410
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,575
Oh, no!

1411
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,869
-When they enter and turn on the lights…
-Yeah?

1412
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,288
They scatter and disappear like roaches.

1413
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,498
Where do they all go?

1414
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:48,710
Well, they cling to the wall
or hide behind the door.

1415
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,546
Or they hide under the desk.

1416
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,384
But

1417
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,470
how do you know about this so well?

1418
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:03,225
You've done a lot of hiding before?

1419
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:05,727
What are you…

1420
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,355
Hey, it was Jun-wan.

1421
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:12,693
When he was a resident,
he did it a lot. I heard it from him.

1422
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,864
I wonder if anyone's here.

1423
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:20,951
Hey, don't!

1424
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,330
This isn't even our hospital.

1425
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,333
Do you hear something?

1426
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,669
I think I hear something.

1427
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:33,380
What was that?

1428
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,465
I think someone knocked.

1429
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:37,259
I don't hear anything.

1430
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,219
-No one's here.
-Did you do that, Song-hwa?

1431
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:41,054
You scared me.

1432
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,639
Let's go.

1433
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,391
I'll let you off today.

1434
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,228
But I don't think young people these days
would come here.

1435
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,732
They all hold hands
and get coffee together out in the open.

1436
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,442
That's only the tip of the iceberg.

1437
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,319
Gosh, Song-hwa.

1438
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,863
You know how many date in secret here?

1439
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,282
It's 520.

1440
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,286
Hey, don't.
What if someone's really in there?

1441
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,459
See?

1442
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,710
It's all in the past.

1443
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,421
Gen Z doesn't do that these days.

1444
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,632
I'm not sure about that.

1445
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:19,217
Even last year, I caught a lot of them.

1446
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,804
I guess there are no roaches here.

1447
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,390
What should we have for dinner?

1448
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,893
The guys want us
to come quick for your discharge party.

1449
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,020
-They want ramyeon.
-Should we get some kimbap…

1450
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:33,857
You told the guys?

1451
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,234
Look, I really wasn't going to tell them.

1452
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,654
But they kept asking where we were

1453
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,656
and when we were coming back,
and eventually--

1454
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,699
That means everyone at the hospital knows.

1455
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,451
I'm sorry.

1456
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,704
I should've just gone to our hospital.

1457
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,165
I came all the way to Jongno,
and now everyone knows.

1458
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:53,460
You're right.

1459
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:57,589
But are you really okay now?

1460
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,633
No, I'm not okay.

1461
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:02,678
My hands are still burning hot
from all that praying.

1462
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:03,679
Do you feel the heat?

1463
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,974
You could've gotten seriously hurt though.

1464
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,394
Please be careful.

1465
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,772
The guys are going to make
so much fun of me.

1466
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:17,567
Why did they leave this door open?

1467
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,237
Shouldn't it be closed?

1468
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,579
They're gone.

1469
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,125
Geez, that was scary.

1470
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:35,043
But,

1471
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:36,837
why did we hide?

1472
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:38,213
What?

1473
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,631
Why did you tell me to hide?

1474
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,007
It's not like we can't be here.

1475
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,468
I told you to hide?

1476
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,096
Yeah, you pushed me under the desk.

1477
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,016
And you sat right next to me
and shushed me.

1478
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,310
I did?

1479
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,814
Why did I do that?

1480
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,608
Well, it was just in case…

1481
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:02,571
in case they scolded us for not working.

1482
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:03,530
But we're done.

1483
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:04,448
Right.

1484
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,956
Hey, even in a tense moment like that,
you could remember and argue every detail.

1485
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:14,916
Is it because you're smart?

1486
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,134
Oh, right. My gown!

1487
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:35,020
-Should I buy you some streusel bread?
-Yeah.

1488
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,242
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUESTS,
CHO JUNG-SEOK & JEON MI-DO,

1489
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,910
OUR ETERNAL LEE IK-JUN & CHAE SONG-HWA

1490
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:35,705
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1491
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,749
The two of you? Where?

1492
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,918
What's this?

1493
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,295
-You're so cute.
-Dr. Ku?

1494
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,714
I have something big to tell you!

1495
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,758
Doctor, don't worry.

1496
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,844
I may not seem like it,
but I'm very loyal.

1497
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,388
Hello. I'm Yi-young's friend,
Pyo Nam-kyung.

1498
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,181
-These days, Yi-young is…
-Don't.

1499
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,517
There you go again.

1500
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,395
-Seong-chan.
-Yesterday, he was your dad and you wept.

1501
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:00,063
Today, he's your son?

1502
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,398
What are you doing?

1503
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:03,358
-You can't just touch that!
-Yi-young!

1504
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,735
Please, can't you just focus
on the contractions?

1505
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,779
-What?
-No, she can't go!

1506
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,364
The baby's umbilical cord is out!

1507
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,116
You can just come up right now yourself!

1508
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,742
-Quit staring!
-Professor?

1509
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,579
Do you remember my request?

1510
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,414
Well, if that's what you want…

1511
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:18,957
Yi-young, take the lead.

1512
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,208
Oh, my God.

1513
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,795
Do you think our age-old OB tradition
will work on Yi-young too?

1514
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,130
Where's Jae-il?

1515
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,131
Why go there at night?

1516
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,716
You're not dating.

1517
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,301
Does Jae-il like you?

1518
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:30,635
Are you two dating?

1519
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,512
Does he really like me?

1520
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,730
