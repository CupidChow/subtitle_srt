EPISODE 4

3
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,447
FOCUS ON YOUR EMOTIONS AND PICK 1 CARD

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,906
REVERSED WHEEL OF FORTUNE

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,160
"The Reversed
Wheel of Fortune Card indicates

6
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,081
a confusing situation
and approaching negative changes"?

7
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,986
Damn it. What was it again?

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,865
I didn't even get to watch their surgery,
so what more am I supposed to write?

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,455
Didn't they order
a placenta pathology for this surgery?

10
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,624
Then it should've been marked.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,001
You're right. What?

12
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,087
You're a genius.

13
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,963
Didn't they also put
a balloon in the uterus?

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,048
That's missing too.

15
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,591
Right.

16
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,721
And I noticed earlier that
there was a typo in Ms. Kim Sin-u's chart.

17
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,807
Where? I read it all.

18
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,643
It was near the middle.

19
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,353
That one. "Doppler."

20
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,188
D-O-P-P-L… It's correct.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,859
"D" should be capitalized
since it's derived from a person's name.

22
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,572
Yes. You're right.

23
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,033
I appreciate it. Thanks.

24
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,415
I don't want you to get scolded again.

25
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,751
It's pretty hard to watch that.

26
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,337
Ask me anytime.

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,923
I like teaching and helping others.

28
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,175
You'll be able to do it well soon.

29
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,301
Sure. Okay.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,558
<i>Arriving at the lobby in five minutes.</i>
<i>Don't be late.</i>

31
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,352
Geez, why is she here?

32
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,396
Hey, it's finally out!

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,313
What is that?

34
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,482
Ta-da.

35
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,067
Check this out.

36
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,279
Don't we look good? Look.

37
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,197
Yi-young.

38
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,324
She was just being herself.

39
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,577
She never listens.

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,287
You should've posed properly.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,122
Who does an old-school jump shot
these days?

42
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,957
Don't you know classics are timeless?

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,085
You were embarrassed then,
but aren't you glad you took it?

44
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,253
If it wasn't for me,

45
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,214
you guys would've missed out
on these first-year memories.

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,467
Let's take one every year.

47
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,261
And in our second year…

48
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,929
Someone's calling.

49
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,809
OH JOO-YOUNG

50
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,021
I'm going now.

51
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,317
I'll be right back.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,027
- Where are you going?
- To meet someone.

53
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
- Who?
- You don't need to know.

54
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,531
Geez, you're so curious.

55
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,035
She always leaves
whenever we mention "second year."

56
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,463
Right, I forgot the adhesion barrier.

57
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,636
She didn't log out.

58
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,353
<i>Bring your friends. I'll treat them.</i>

59
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,564
<i>I told you we're not friends.</i>
<i>We're just coworkers.</i>

60
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,108
<i>Why make friends when I'm quitting soon?</i>

61
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,405
<i>Geez, you're impossible.</i>

62
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,491
<i>No wonder you never have friends.</i>

63
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,993
<i>I really can't do this anymore.</i>

64
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>That's enough.</i>

65
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,541
<i>Really? Then should I quit today?</i>

66
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,542
<i>Or tomorrow?</i>

67
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,711
She doesn't mean it.

68
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,005
We all keep a resignation letter handy.

69
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,923
What for?

70
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,762
Let her be. She'll be the only one
who loses out if she quits.

71
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,972
Why should I care?

72
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,765
Let her be
a third-time resident applicant.

73
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,351
I hope she doesn't quit.

74
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,937
I could help her
with charting and study sessions.

75
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,855
Hey! Me too!

76
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,985
Help me out too. I think I'll get fired
even before I write my resignation letter.

77
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,237
They're short on residents.
I doubt you'll get fired.

78
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,948
I see.

79
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,702
You only speak facts, don't you?

80
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,581
You guys speak
completely different languages.

81
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,667
No wonder you can't communicate.

82
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,961
- You startled me.
- Oh Yi-young!

83
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,296
Did she throw this away?

84
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,590
I worked hard to print this.

85
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,467
She must've dropped it while leaving.

86
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,804
You can comfort others too.

87
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,312
Who said anything
about quitting right now?

88
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,940
Every resident thinks about quitting.

89
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,400
Right?

90
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,612
You do have an ounce of conscience
and a tiny bit of common sense, don't you?

91
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,364
Of course I do.

92
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,783
Come on. I wouldn't be able to do
this job otherwise.

93
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,537
It's unlike you to splurge like this.

94
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,289
I didn't pay.

95
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,707
Do-won did.

96
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,168
This one's their signature cake.

97
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,670
This is the new release.
And what was this again?

98
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,130
His favorite.

99
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,176
Now that you work together,
you know his preferences too.

100
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,803
It's my favorite too.

101
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,973
Geez, you and your love for pastries.
Have it all.

102
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,939
It would've been nice
if he'd eaten with us.

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,485
He said he wasn't busy at all today
and told me to eat before leaving.

104
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,780
- Maybe there's an emergency?
- I wouldn't be here in that case.

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,697
Good point.

106
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,951
- Did you say I was coming?
- You?

107
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,203
Yes, I did.

108
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,207
- Did you two fight?
- No.

109
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,667
- He must've scolded you.
- No, he didn't.

110
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,211
- Do your job well!
- I am!

111
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,379
- How can I believe that?
- Think however you want.

112
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,714
I didn't mean it anyway.

113
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,425
You little… Unbelievable.

114
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,219
Why are you here anyway?

115
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,514
Did you actually come to check up on me?

116
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,390
Yes, I came to see if you're behaving.

117
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,602
Geez. I'm now 41.95 million won in debt.

118
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,354
- Once I'm done--
- Okay.

119
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,606
Focus on eating,
or you'll have an upset stomach.

120
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,624
I'm thinking of trying again.

121
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,003
Getting pregnant.

122
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,298
I had a consultation
at the fertility center today.

123
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,260
How come?
I thought you didn't want to try again.

124
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,264
Now that six months have passed,
I have the desire to try again.

125
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,143
I'm still thinking about it.

126
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,604
It's a shame to give up
after only trying for four years.

127
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,484
I want to try again before I hit 40.

128
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,362
I haven't told Seung-won yet.

129
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,905
It's a secret.

130
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,576
Just…

131
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,620
focus on raising me first.

132
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,747
I'm still far from being a proper adult.

133
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,458
So you're aware.

134
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,752
HUSBAND

135
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,715
Hi, honey.

136
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,302
Yes, I stopped by the hospital.

137
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,722
I saw Do-won briefly,
and now I'm with Yi-young.

138
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,891
I asked.

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,268
He said "no" to a blind date.

140
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,148
I can't ask him that.

141
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,233
You can ask. You're his brother.

142
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,321
Yi-young?

143
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,032
Okay. Bye.

144
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,202
What blind date?

145
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,205
Seung-won wanted to hook him up
with one of his coworkers.

146
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,789
But Do-won refused.

147
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,374
I see.

148
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,839
Hey, by the way,

149
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,925
is he seeing anyone at the hospital?

150
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,553
I don't think so.

151
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,180
Or…

152
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,351
Maybe any rumors about him liking someone.
Does he not like anyone?

153
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,769
I…

154
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,187
don't think so.

155
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,147
Wait.

156
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,024
Does anyone like him?

157
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,485
Did anyone say
that they're interested in him?

158
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,403
I'm sure there's someone.

159
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,655
Don't you know?

160
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,077
There is one person.

161
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,956
Right? There is someone, isn't there?

162
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,873
Who is it?

163
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,501
Who is it?

164
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,134
Don't ask me.

165
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,345
- How would I know?
- Hey!

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,431
Geez. Did you have to shout?

167
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,975
So do you know or not?

168
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,142
I'm telling you to drop it.

169
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,561
Are you serious right now?

170
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,649
Thank you for calling.

171
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,818
I'll be right there.

172
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,042
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

173
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,223
Who is it?

174
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,768
Knock, knock. I heard the news.

175
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,728
What news?

176
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,273
That you have the same taste as me.

177
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,657
I like women.

178
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,492
What? Well…

179
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,662
Me too. I like them a lot.

180
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,999
That's not what I meant.
I heard you like tennis.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,752
I see. And?

182
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,089
Why don't we create
a Yulje tennis team and meet up regularly?

183
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,550
We could socialize and exercise.

184
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,552
Befriending other departments
can't be bad.

185
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,805
Every Friday at eight o'clock.

186
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,057
Fridays don't work for me.

187
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,725
Right. You're busy.

188
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,934
Do it without me.

189
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,270
How can we? You're the team chairman.

190
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,563
OB-GYN
4TH-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE

191
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,649
- Me?
- Yes, we all agreed on it.

192
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,695
I wish it were some other day too,
but they're all free on Fridays.

193
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,281
So just do it without me.
I'm busy on Fridays.

194
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,533
I know. Everyone at the hospital knows.

195
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,870
You eat Chinese food at the food court,

196
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,247
organize the next week's surgeries
in the conference room,

197
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,833
buy two cans of beer
at the convenience store on your way home,

198
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,336
and then, <i>tudum,</i>
end your Friday night with Netflix.

199
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,380
You live a boring,
lonely life, yet enjoy it.

200
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,964
Mr. Boring Routine.

201
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,549
We all know.

202
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,429
It's super fun.

203
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,265
That's what keeps me going.
I endure the whole week just to do that.

204
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,771
Why am I wasting time
talking about this with you?

205
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,981
Right. I'm sorry.

206
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,317
If you're sorry, go do your job.

207
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,323
I also need to go in--

208
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,366
Go somewhere else.

209
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,367
Should I do that?

210
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,581
I'll see you later
in the sixth-floor conference room.

211
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,426
The research topic is

212
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,179
"predicting preterm birth
through cervical elasticity measurements."

213
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:07,309
As of now, Dr. Ki and Dr. Park
are doing the research.

214
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,019
I'd like one of you

215
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,064
to handle
the statistical analysis of this data,

216
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,234
oversee the overall progress,
and write the abstract.

217
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,903
If it turns out well,

218
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
we'll submit it to ISUOG

219
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,451
which will be held in Italy this year.

220
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
You'll be able to attend
a conference abroad.

221
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,415
Your name will be listed
as the first author if you do well.

222
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
You'll be learning a lot.

223
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,641
Why don't you give it a try, Yi-young?

224
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,395
Me?

225
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,607
I…

226
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,822
I don't have the ability
or diligence for that.

227
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,283
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,076
We won't know until you try.

229
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,871
Judging by your face, you seem interested.

230
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,872
Right?

231
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,251
Okay.

232
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,629
I'll give it a try.

233
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,672
She'll write the first paper.

234
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,092
Then Sa-bi, Nam-kyung, and Jae-il
will write in this order.

235
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,261
- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am.

236
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,849
Please email me a summary
of the progress of your assigned research

237
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,934
at the end of each month.

238
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:30,851
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,105
Gosh, Professor Seo is so eloquent.

240
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,317
I mean, I was raising my hand
before I even knew it.

241
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,819
I was totally persuaded
when she mentioned Italy.

242
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,447
When I came to my senses,
my hand was already up.

243
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
But how will I make time for it?

244
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,285
Why did she ask us
to raise our hand anyway?

245
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,746
Wasn't she looking for volunteers?

246
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,248
This is so unfair.

247
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,667
You're right. It's completely unfair.

248
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,584
Exactly.

249
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,213
Why give the opportunity
to someone who wants to quit?

250
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,096
What a waste of opportunity.

251
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,723
Hey.

252
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,274
We didn't mean to pry.

253
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,568
You didn't log out when you left.

254
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,406
Sa-bi is just upset
since you said you're quitting.

255
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,408
I know you didn't mean it.

256
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,035
We're friends, so please understand.

257
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,372
Understand what?
That she's upset because I said I'd quit?

258
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,834
That sounds like an excuse to me.

259
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,337
Or that she's upset
since I'm doing the paper?

260
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,506
Both.

261
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,341
That's not true. It's the latter.

262
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,594
She's upset over nothing.

263
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,806
I have a hair appointment.
Bye. Good luck with your shift.

264
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,183
Good luck.

265
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,150
Hello.

266
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,027
Hello.

267
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,071
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,033
I'm so used to wearing my surgery gown.

269
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,743
I see. You must be a doctor.

270
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,660
Yes, I am.

271
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,040
- You must've set aside some time to come.
- Yes, I barely managed to make time.

272
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,961
Yes?

273
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,589
Dr. Pyo, it's about Ms. Kim Hyeong-ja.

274
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,467
You prescribed an NSAID,
but she says she's allergic to it.

275
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,011
I think you need to prescribe
a different painkiller.

276
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,556
Then give her acetaminophen.

277
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,516
I'll type up the prescription myself.

278
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,935
I'm sorry for the hassle.

279
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,313
Okay. Sorry.

280
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,027
Dr. Pyo, that's not how you should work.

281
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,695
What? Hello, ma'am.

282
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,907
It doesn't seem like a big deal,
so why are you sorry?

283
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,824
Sorry?

284
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,202
Was that a nurse?

285
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,370
Yes.

286
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,913
It's May already.

287
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,915
You should stop being a pushover.

288
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,585
You're a resident after all.

289
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,503
Right.

290
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,505
But what about it?

291
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,680
Thank you for teaching me
so much, Dr. Myeong.

292
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,723
It's nothing, really.

293
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,892
I just wanted to introduce
some new hair products.

294
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,435
Don't you think you bought too much?

295
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,980
I realized I needed all of them.

296
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,232
Thank goodness we bought this shampoo.

297
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,777
I put in plenty of samples
for you to use at the hospital.

298
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,861
Really?

299
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,488
Thank you.

300
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,532
Thank you. I'll come again.

301
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,533
Goodbye.

302
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,326
- Thank you
- Goodbye.

303
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,544
They're so not street-smart, are they?

304
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,923
Gosh, should I have bought
another conditioner?

305
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,092
I agree. We could've just stocked up.

306
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,010
Exactly.

307
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,971
- I'm headed that way.
- I'm taking the subway.

308
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,139
Okay. Bye.

309
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,557
Get home safe.

310
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,524
<i>Do you think Yi-young will really quit?</i>

311
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>I told you she didn't mean it.</i>

312
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,779
<i>I told you that</i>
<i>people don't always mean what they say.</i>

313
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,908
<i>She should just quit already</i>
<i>if she's going to anyway,</i>

314
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,494
<i>so I can work on Professor Seo's paper.</i>

315
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,776
- Who is it?
- Sir, it's Oh Yi-young, first-year.

316
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,159
- What is it? An emergency?
- No, it's not.

317
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,952
I'm on call today,

318
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,246
and I didn't want to
call the professor at this hour.

319
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,540
I just need your confirmation.

320
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,625
Sure.

321
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,461
Patient Woo Jeong-hyo's water broke
about ten hours ago.

322
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,171
Should I start antibiotics?

323
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,422
What's her temperature?

324
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,965
It's 37°C.

325
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,887
Let's wait a bit longer
and start once it's been 12 hours.

326
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,474
And Ms. Kang Hyeon-yeong
who had postpartum hemorrhage.

327
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,685
Her hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL.
When should we follow up?

328
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,187
She's…

329
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,898
Is she Professor Seo's patient
from today's surgery?

330
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,816
Correct.

331
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,569
- Let's do it on POD 2.
- Okay.

332
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:33,987
One more thing.

333
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,990
This one feels weak
because she hasn't eaten yet.

334
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,826
She can't eat now
as no restaurant is open.

335
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,160
What should we do?

336
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,412
- Who is she?
- Me.

337
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:56,260
OB-GYN
4TH-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE

338
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,262
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

339
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,806
Hello.

340
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,267
Sa-bi, you're early today.

341
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,768
This is when I always come.

342
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,769
I see.

343
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,313
And breakfast? Let's go
to the convenience store and--

344
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,731
I always have this.

345
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,441
I see.

346
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,985
You're well-prepared.

347
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,736
Okay. I'll see you later then.

348
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,865
Okay. Bye.

349
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,455
Hi.

350
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,041
Hey, you're here.

351
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,967
Can you stop shaking your leg?

352
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,052
What?

353
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,013
Right. Okay.

354
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,931
And that's my pen.

355
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,686
Okay. Sorry.

356
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,444
By the way…

357
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,574
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,453
I'm reviewing Ms. Hwangbo Bo-hyeon's case.

359
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,954
Me?

360
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,207
I've never done that before--

361
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,001
Today will be my first.

362
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,629
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,134
Was that Professor Seo?

364
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,470
Yes, there's a multidisciplinary
prenatal consultation with CS.

365
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,679
She wants me to explain it.

366
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,056
A multidisciplinary consultation?

367
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,559
I didn't know
first-years got to attend them.

368
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,810
Me neither.

369
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,728
What for?

370
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,813
Because of the mother? Or the baby?

371
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,025
She's a mother who had a stillbirth
at 32 weeks due to Ebstein anomaly.

372
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,778
The same anomaly was detected again
in the recent ultrasound.

373
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,906
Those cases are very rare.

374
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,741
Will they do an amniotic fluid test?

375
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,284
Don't tell me you're assisting.

376
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,203
I wouldn't know.

377
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,210
Have you read any papers
on fetal Ebstein anomaly?

378
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,212
Or maybe in a textbook?

379
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,884
I don't know everything.

380
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,553
That's true.

381
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,434
Yes?

382
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,103
I'm on my way.

383
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,195
Damn it. Whatever.

384
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,578
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION

385
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,915
Twenty weeks and how many days?

386
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,837
It's been 20 weeks and two days.

387
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,213
What about the first pregnancy?

388
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,924
I wasn't here then,

389
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,759
so I'm not sure.

390
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,057
How is that an excuse?

391
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,559
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,061
During her first pregnancy in 2021,

393
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,189
Ebstein anomaly was detected
during the 20-week detailed ultrasound.

394
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,191
The pregnancy continued
but ended in stillbirth.

395
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,109
At that time--

396
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,361
Her first pregnancy,
so an amniocentesis wasn't performed?

397
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,321
Yes, that's correct.

398
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,655
It's all in the record.

399
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,782
How is the attending doctor
explaining this to me

400
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,285
without properly understanding
her own patient?

401
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,538
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,040
What's the issue with the heart?

403
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,294
The tricuspid valve position is abnormal,
so the left ventricle--

404
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,211
Right ventricle.

405
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,506
Right.

406
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,053
The right ventricle is small,
and the blood…

407
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,976
- flows back to the left atrium--
- Right atrium.

408
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,021
Pressure in the right atrium
is causing the atrial hypertrophy.

409
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,230
Right.

410
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,900
How will the guardian understand
and give you their consent

411
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,028
when you know so little
about your patient's case?

412
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,613
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,407
- You're here.
- Hey. Delivery?

414
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,825
Yes. Sorry.

415
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,537
Hey.

416
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,041
Why are you grilling
my resident at my hospital?

417
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,127
I wasn't grilling her.
I just asked a few questions.

418
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,005
I'll take care of my residents.
You just worry about CS.

419
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,632
I have no residents to worry about.

420
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,676
We got three newbies this year,
and I haven't seen one in days.

421
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,678
I don't know. Whatever.

422
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,180
You're envious, aren't you?

423
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,350
Yes, of just one of them.

424
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,185
Thanks for coming.

425
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,063
Our pediatric thoracic surgeon,
Professor Cha Byeong-seon,

426
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,481
wanted you to take a look.

427
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,774
Yes, he called.

428
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,276
Take a look at this.

429
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,865
Ebstein anomaly was detected
during the 19-week detailed ultrasound

430
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,158
of Ms. Hwangbo Bo-hyeon.

431
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,036
We're planning to perform
an amniocentesis for genetic testing

432
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,246
during her next visit.

433
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,083
The same heart defect was found
during her first pregnancy two years ago.

434
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,419
We couldn't determine the genetic cause
since genetic testing wasn't performed.

435
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,463
She had a stillbirth at 32 weeks.

436
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,049
The heart defect is identical.

437
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,554
I hope the baby weighs
at least 2.7 kg at birth.

438
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,182
The surgery will be riskier
if the baby is too small.

439
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,350
I think we can manage

440
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,228
if there is no heart failure
or cardiomegaly until 34 weeks.

441
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,229
What's your take?

442
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,399
It's a milder type
compared to two years ago.

443
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,985
The blood is flowing well
through the pulmonary artery.

444
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,988
The baby is growing appropriately
for gestational age.

445
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,701
But it's still only 20 weeks,
so we need to monitor longer.

446
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,662
Schedule a consultation with the mother.
I'll be there.

447
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,373
Let's discuss the results
in the next multidisciplinary meeting.

448
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,416
Got it.

449
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,126
MULTIDISCIPLINARY: MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS

450
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,712
Let's do well
so we can drink that this time.

451
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,757
Yes, if it pans out,

452
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,093
then we'll open it.

453
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,434
Okay, that's it for the day.

454
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,269
Now that we're done, applaud!

455
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,993
I'm sorry.

456
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,203
Dr. Oh.

457
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,247
We're discussing a life-and-death issue,
and you're sleepy?

458
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,999
I'm sorry.

459
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,044
I was on call yesterday
and couldn't sleep at all.

460
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,046
Right, you don't sleep
when you're on call,

461
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,964
and you're expected to work the next day.

462
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,299
Yes, sir.

463
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,928
You remind me a lot of someone.

464
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,181
There's this guy
who always has something to say

465
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,725
even when he makes

466
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,477
mistakes.

467
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,188
Speak of the devil.

468
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,525
What is it now, Dr. Do Jae-hak?
This is your third time calling today.

469
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,321
<i>I just have a question.</i>
<i>It's about my patient, Ms. Kim Jin-hee.</i>

470
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,239
Okay.

471
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,784
A shunt revision?

472
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,410
- You can go.
- Okay.

473
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,787
Yes.

474
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,414
Is she on epinephrine?

475
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,749
Okay.

476
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,378
Here.

477
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,882
You're slightly burning up.

478
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,802
How come? I wonder why.

479
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,596
An excellent doctor
will come to treat you in 30 minutes.

480
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,140
Okay. Gosh.

481
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,144
Please go down, fever.

482
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,188
Hello.

483
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,523
Hello.

484
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,737
What are you doing?

485
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,447
Sorry?

486
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,909
See?

487
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,079
Even you can't hold onto them for long
since they're too cold.

488
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,082
So what made you think
of putting them under her armpits?

489
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,668
I'm sorry. She said her fever was rising.

490
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,837
Of course her fever is rising.

491
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,839
That's why she's getting chills!

492
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,092
And yet you gave ice packs
to a patient with chills.

493
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,721
Would you want these freezing ice packs
if you were her?

494
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:39,848
No.

495
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,519
Did you think putting those on her
and looking at her lovingly

496
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,271
would make her fever go down?

497
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,856
I'm sorry.

498
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,816
You should've notified me!

499
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,735
I knew you were coming soon.

500
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,239
And her fever kept hovering around 37.7°C.

501
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,116
The medication
wasn't really working either.

502
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,660
I had to notify you to give an injection.

503
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,911
But I couldn't do that

504
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,749
because even I was unsure of myself. Well…

505
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,005
I felt bad about calling you
so early in the morning.

506
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,008
That's exactly why you shouldn't call
for unnecessary things.

507
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,801
Call for urgent situations like this!

508
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,553
Yes, it's my fault.

509
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,013
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,724
Seriously.

511
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,601
Gosh, this is infuriating.

512
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,355
You and your apologies.

513
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,191
You'd better not.

514
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,611
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,240
Dr. Cha isn't someone
who gets annoyed by such calls.

516
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,202
You could call her at dawn,

517
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,079
and she'll still come right away.

518
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,457
Everyone knows that. Didn't you know?

519
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,254
Dr. Um, you made a mistake.

520
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,840
Yes, it's my fault.

521
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,928
We're waiting
for Dr. Um's prescription now.

522
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,638
Really?

523
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,348
We'll be quick.

524
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,683
Dr. Um.

525
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,186
I'm sorry, I'll do it right away.

526
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,246
You're apologizing night and day.

527
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,457
Gosh, you're an idiot.

528
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,252
Yes. I am an idiot.

529
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,548
You're the reason
the nurses look down on us

530
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,591
and dump their work on us.

531
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,348
<i>About that surgery note…</i>

532
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,516
Yes, Doctor.

533
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,811
<i>They were twins,</i>
<i>but you wrote it on the singleton form.</i>

534
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,604
Me?

535
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,273
Did I do that?

536
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,109
Yes, could you rewrite it
on the form for twins?

537
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,903
I'll fix it right away. I'm sorry.

538
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,656
No, it's not your fault.
The file format was wrong.

539
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,158
The content was pretty good.

540
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,242
I see.

541
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,660
<i>Right, Ms. Min Ju-hee.</i>

542
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,163
<i>She also had twins</i>
<i>after a salpingectomy just like this case,</i>

543
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,664
<i>so use that as your reference.</i>

544
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,083
Yi-young wrote it,
and she did a pretty good job.

545
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,795
Okay.

546
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,964
By the way, have you eaten?

547
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,425
<i>I left some pizza</i>
<i>in the on-call room, so have some--</i>

548
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,720
Thank you, but I have no appetite.

549
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,055
Goodbye.

550
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,396
I taught her how to do this.

551
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,919
AUTHOR: R1 OH YI-YOUNG
SAVE EMPTY DOCUMENT 1?

552
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,481
How could you lose the data?

553
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,984
Everyone has wasted their time
this morning, thanks to you.

554
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,236
What have you done?

555
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,862
The Witch has exploded again.

556
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,615
I can't hear anything.

557
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,492
So why am I sweating?

558
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,745
I was happy
about the study being canceled.

559
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,830
I feel bad now.

560
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,998
Yi-young has definitely lost interest.

561
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,292
I mean, how could you lose the data?

562
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,712
Professor Seo won't let this one slide.

563
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,800
It's either "You're banned from the OR"
or "Don't let me hear you breathing."

564
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,760
I bet it's one of them.

565
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,595
What? Aren't they the same thing?

566
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,059
Then who'll assist
Professor Seo's surgery?

567
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,811
- I'm not going.
- Me neither.

568
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,188
We're busy in Gynecology.

569
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,773
Then,

570
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,441
should I go?

571
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,359
Yes.

572
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,572
God damn it.

573
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,699
That stupid computer.

574
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,493
I definitely did it before I left.

575
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,661
Kim Sa-bi.

576
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,496
You also saw it, didn't you?

577
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,081
What? Yes.

578
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,917
Why didn't you save it?

579
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,879
We're grateful that
the study got canceled though.

580
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,714
Hey, what did the professor say?

581
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,885
I'm to prepare all the study materials
for the next three months.

582
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,762
As for surgeries…

583
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,682
I'm stuck with them forever.

584
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,143
She wants me to attend
every single one of them.

585
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,562
Geez. That's absolutely the worst.

586
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,941
I don't know what to say to comfort you.

587
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,235
Don't say anything.

588
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,820
Okay.

589
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,267
Let's say you comforted me too.

590
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,327
I heard you got scolded again.

591
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,497
I did.

592
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,624
In my four years as a resident,

593
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,629
I've never seen anyone
lose study materials.

594
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,005
I didn't…

595
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,301
I'm sorry.

596
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,137
- Did you forget you were scolded?
- No, I didn't.

597
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,430
I took her words to heart.

598
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,891
Just brush it off.

599
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,020
Forget about the scolding and focus.

600
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,232
Make a mistake in here,
and it won't just end with a scolding.

601
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,733
You know that, right?

602
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,278
I do.

603
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,116
Hello.

604
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,661
The patient has
a history of two myomectomies,

605
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,371
so there could be severe adhesions.

606
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,873
- Make sure to maintain good visibility.
- Yes, ma'am.

607
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,793
Do-won will make the uterine incision.

608
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,836
Yes, ma'am.

609
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,300
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

610
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,304
Let's open the uterovesical serosa first.

611
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,222
Yes, ma'am.

612
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,226
Curvilinear on both sides.

613
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,436
A CURVED LINE

614
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,690
Push the serosa down.

615
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,625
Okay.

616
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,961
Let's make the uterine incision.

617
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:07,879
Yes, ma'am.

618
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,929
I'm so sorry.

619
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,098
- Are you okay?
- Yes, the field is safe.

620
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,018
Why was this upside down?

621
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,312
What do I do? I'm really sorry!

622
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,897
What should I do?

623
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,774
What should I do? I'm sorry!

624
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,317
That's enough. It's okay.

625
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,276
Give me the scalpel.

626
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,739
- Can you apply fundal with your left hand?
- Yes, ma'am.

627
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,532
Let's get the baby out in one minute.

628
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,951
Go straight to the ER
once we deliver the baby.

629
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,161
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,915
Remove the instrument.

631
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,502
- Fundal.
- Yes, ma'am.

632
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,511
The baby is out.

633
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,804
Hi.

634
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,555
It's a baby girl, born at 2:20 p.m.

635
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,443
Good. You should go.

636
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,737
- Make a call to the ER, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

637
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,448
Will you be okay?
The bleeding seems to have stopped.

638
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,742
It's okay. I have Yi-young.

639
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,495
What are you doing? Switch places.

640
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,039
Pardon?

641
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,253
It's nothing serious.

642
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,547
It happens often.

643
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,925
The patient is the most important.
You know that, right?

644
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,718
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,515
Cut.

646
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,893
Please give a pair to Dr. Oh too.

647
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,520
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,945
The patient plans to have a second child,
so we need to do a good suture.

649
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,405
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,548
- Pull a bit tighter.
- Yes, ma'am.

651
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,553
Proper approximation
will prevent the tissue from separating.

652
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,721
Yes, ma'am.

653
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,436
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

654
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,864
This is GYN Ward 101.

655
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,201
I see.

656
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,328
Okay, I understand.

657
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,579
Goodbye.

658
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,708
Doctor, it's Ms. Hwang Su-yeong
in Room 1018.

659
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,001
Her SBP is 180.

660
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,295
She's controlling her blood pressure
with beta blockers,

661
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,922
so could you write a prescription?

662
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,801
Dr. Pyo, the prescription…

663
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,890
Dr. Pyo?

664
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:08,976
Yes?

665
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,229
Oh, you didn't hear me.

666
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,898
Ms. Hwang Su-yeong's SBP is 180.

667
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,032
Well… If you prescribe
beta blockers, I'll--

668
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,033
I already did.

669
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,579
I see. Thank you.

670
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,332
One more thing.

671
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,252
- Ms. Yang Jang-hee in Room 1012.
- Yes?

672
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,337
Please check her I/O every two hours.

673
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,421
Every two hours?

674
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,132
I don't think
she needs that much monitoring.

675
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,425
I've put in the order.

676
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,930
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,115
Doctor.

678
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,867
It's a small cut.
Why are you wrapping it so much?

679
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,411
Your mother called

680
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,123
and demanded perfect treatment
both aesthetically and functionally.

681
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,249
Mom? What mom?

682
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,251
- Professor Seo.
- Geez.

683
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,506
The person who did this
is going to feel extremely guilty.

684
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,466
Do you think so?

685
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,098
Can I help you?

686
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,351
Oh, she's the guilty one.

687
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,269
I see.

688
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,234
I'm sorry.

689
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,487
It's okay.
I also cut Professor Seo many times.

690
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,364
These things happen sometimes.

691
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,868
Does it hurt?

692
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,785
No.

693
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,537
Not one bit.

694
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,876
Why do you feel so guilty?
I said I was fine.

695
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,588
How's the patient?

696
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,676
There was less bleeding than expected,
and her uterine contractions are normal.

697
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,594
That's good.

698
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,638
Did you assist well?

699
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,224
Did you suture the wound nicely?

700
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,061
Yes, sir.

701
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,357
I'm truly sorry.

702
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,651
I was focusing.
I just felt like I needed to do something.

703
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,321
I was in a haste. I'm really sorry.

704
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,575
I said I'm okay. I'm really fine. Just go.

705
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,243
- Let me rest.
- Let me take a look.

706
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,953
What's there to see? I'm okay, so go.

707
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,622
- But I'm worried.
- It's fine.

708
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,624
Obstetrics, quick. It's an emergency.

709
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,627
AMBULANCE ENTRANCE ONLY

710
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,129
119 EMERGENCY SERVICES

711
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,298
She's 20 weeks pregnant. Her water broke.

712
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,258
She was on her way here as an outpatient.

713
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,593
Hwangbo Bo-hyeon, age 38.

714
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,804
Current temperature, 39°C.
Blood pressure 90 over 60.

715
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,138
This way, please.

716
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,390
That's…

717
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,436
Ms. Hwangbo Bo-hyeon

718
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,647
was scheduled
for an amniocentesis this afternoon.

719
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,940
But her water broke.

720
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,567
There's almost no amniotic fluid left.

721
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,821
We've canceled her scheduled test for now.

722
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,738
Professor.

723
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,033
The blood test result shows
that the WBC count is over 18,000,

724
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,202
and the CRP has increased to 30.

725
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,163
It appears the amniotic sac ruptured
due to chorioamnionitis.

726
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,040
Her temperature is 40°C.

727
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,292
Considering her blood pressure
isn't rising,

728
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,920
it seems to have progressed to sepsis.

729
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:23,963
I'm afraid…

730
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,008
the baby…

731
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,570
The chorioamnionitis infection
has spread within the uterus

732
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,906
and is progressing
to a systemic infection.

733
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,828
I'm afraid continuing the pregnancy
will be difficult.

734
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,331
No, Doctor! I don't want that…

735
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,712
The baby is currently
20 weeks and three days old.

736
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,881
It's less than 300 grams.

737
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,717
As you know,
the baby won't be able to survive

738
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,844
even if it's born.

739
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:16,140
Why is this happening to me?
What did I do wrong this time?

740
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,057
Last time,

741
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,186
the baby was fine until 32 weeks
despite a heart problem.

742
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,147
You must be mistaken. I don't want to.

743
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,775
Doctor.

744
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,238
Just one day.

745
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,868
Let me keep the baby
for just one more day.

746
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,123
Please let me be a mother
for one more day.

747
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,043
Only I can feel it.

748
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,421
The baby is still alive.

749
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,758
My baby can hold on, Doctor.

750
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,427
You'll be at risk if the sepsis worsens.

751
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,847
We need to proceed
with induced labor quickly--

752
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,891
Please save my baby, Doctor.

753
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,143
Please. Let me meet my baby.

754
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,771
Please! I'll do anything!

755
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,232
Let's stop here. Okay?

756
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,691
Let's stop.

757
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,902
I don't want to say goodbye again!

758
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,780
I don't want to! I can't!

759
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,073
Let's stop…

760
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,260
I know it's difficult

761
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,514
to cope with the process of letting go.

762
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,807
But currently,

763
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,394
vaginal delivery
is the best option for her.

764
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,688
We'll proceed quickly with induced labor.

765
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,315
Okay.

766
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,277
Is it the same as before?

767
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,279
Yes.

768
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,864
And,

769
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,784
regarding the baby's heart defect…

770
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,746
Would you like to have it tested?

771
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,959
My wife thinks

772
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,296
that our previous baby didn't die.

773
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:15,926
She thinks it just left for a while
and has returned again this time.

774
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,806
She felt guilty
for sending the baby away all alone.

775
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,392
She said she wanted to
meet the baby and apologize.

776
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,064
Throughout her pregnancy,
she was too scared to sleep soundly.

777
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,651
She'll probably

778
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,654
want to meet the baby again.

779
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,369
We'll do the test.

780
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,414
My wife wants that as well,

781
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,834
but she probably feels
too bad for the baby to say it.

782
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,421
An amniocentesis isn't possible right now.

783
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,925
We'll proceed with another test
as I explained before.

784
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,763
These doctors
will explain everything again.

785
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,016
Okay.

786
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,268
By the way…

787
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,856
Will it be painless?

788
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,274
Yes.

789
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,235
We'll prepare everything well.

790
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,163
Do-won.

791
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,917
Let's have Dr. Oh handle the tests

792
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,669
for Ms. Hwangbo's baby.

793
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,214
And have her practice suturing
when you have time.

794
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,131
She has good hands.

795
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,425
I want her to do
perineal suturing next time.

796
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,761
Yes. Okay.

797
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,347
I asked her to gather the research data.

798
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,057
Don't worry about it.

799
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,351
Yes. That's right.

800
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,852
Okay. I'll be right there.

801
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,652
<i>Oh Yi-young, email me the references</i>
<i>on premature labor for the introduction</i>

802
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,529
<i>by this afternoon.</i>

803
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,243
Yes, Doctor?

804
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,581
Well… She kept getting angry
whenever I tried to do the pelvic exam.

805
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,710
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,921
I'll try to do it
without causing any pain.

807
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,589
Goodbye.

808
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,603
OH YI-YOUNG, EMAIL ME THE REFERENCES
ON PREMATURE LABOR FOR THE INTRODUCTION

809
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,021
BY THIS AFTERNOON

810
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,214
Over here! Please come quickly!

811
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,663
Doctor, are you busy?

812
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,499
Yes.

813
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,671
It's about
Ms. Min Yeong-sil's surgery tomorrow.

814
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,090
We're going to add antibiotics
to normal saline.

815
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,675
Didn't I already order that?

816
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,638
Yes, but usually,
antibiotics are mixed with 50 cc of NS.

817
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,931
The prescription says 100 cc.

818
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,726
Could you please modify it?

819
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,398
Isn't it supposed to be 100?

820
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,568
I'm sure it is. Geez.

821
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,156
Okay, I understand.

822
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,332
I've reordered it with 50 cc.

823
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,722
Ta-da! Today seems quieter than--

824
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,183
- Don't say that. Keep your mouth shut.
- Right.

825
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:34,935
Okay.

826
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,522
Nothing unusual in the ward, is there?

827
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,148
Of course. There is something.

828
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,858
What? What is it?

829
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,903
- I got even for you.
- Even?

830
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,824
To whom am I supposed to prescribe
an even number?

831
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,577
No, not that kind of "even."

832
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,372
- Nurse Ju-yeon.
- What?

833
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,417
You guys were in there last time.

834
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,545
In there?

835
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,088
What?

836
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,508
- What?
- What?

837
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,426
What?

838
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,761
- What?
- What are you saying?

839
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,055
- What is this?
- What do you…

840
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,933
Hey, Nurse Ju-yeon.

841
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,145
- Don't you feel tired?
- Yes.

842
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,231
Ta-da. There are almonds inside.

843
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,317
Thank you.

844
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,736
- Going to Room 1012?
- Yes.

845
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,322
- Did the surgery go well?
- Yes, it was superfast.

846
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,452
<i>Yi-young.</i>

847
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,914
<i>Professor Seo said to email the materials…</i>

848
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,877
What are you doing?

849
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,919
Nothing.

850
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,131
Geez. Greedy with food, aren't you?

851
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,802
- By the way, have you seen Yi-young?
- Yes.

852
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,013
Where is she? What's she doing?

853
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,432
What else?
Getting an earful from Seo Jung-min again.

854
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,225
- Why?
- Beats me.

855
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,605
Seriously. How many times
has she been scolded?

856
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,857
What if she really quits?

857
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,488
Have you seen Jae-il?

858
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,324
He said he was going to eat <i>tteokbokki</i>
with the nurses.

859
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,409
But he can't even handle spicy food.

860
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,205
You two must be close.
You even know his preference.

861
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,040
Hardly.

862
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,751
I believe he mentioned it before.

863
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,711
Did he?

864
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,009
Pyo Nam-kyung speaking.

865
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,304
I'll be right there.

866
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,769
I'm leaving. Enjoy your meal.

867
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,363
- Doctor.
- Yes?

868
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,864
- It's about Ms. Oh Mi-ok.
- Okay.

869
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,867
She's getting her chemo right now
and feels very nauseous.

870
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,579
I think you should check on her
before Professor Jo's rounds.

871
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,497
Okay.

872
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,833
Do you feel very nauseous?

873
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,002
What if we stop the chemo for now,

874
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,755
give her some hydration,
and administer an antiemetic?

875
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,509
I'll give you an antiemetic first.

876
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,219
For her next chemo session,

877
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,471
let's use an antiemetic patch
the day before.

878
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,556
Okay.

879
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,809
The medication is almost finished though.

880
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,395
It's okay.

881
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,480
Throw up until you feel better. It's okay.

882
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,398
Nurse Cho-won!

883
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,275
Coming.

884
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:30,944
- Please hold it.
- Okay.

885
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,328
- Doctor.
- Yes?

886
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,831
- I need an antiemetic prescription.
- Right. Okay.

887
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,542
- I'll bring the medication.
- Okay.

888
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,137
Nurse Cho-won,
I prescribed metoclopramide.

889
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,138
Okay.

890
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,015
MEDICATION USED FOR NAUSEA AND VOMITING

891
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,787
Okay. I'll head up now.

892
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,875
It's become such a habit for us
that our hands move automatically.

893
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,129
Don't you feel better now?
You must've been so uncomfortable.

894
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:32,964
Thank you.

895
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,175
The medication is working well.

896
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,303
I thought the cleaner would be here soon.

897
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:42,349
I was worried about the other patients
in the room, so I just cleaned it up.

898
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,100
There wasn't much to clean anyway.

899
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,354
Professor Jo will give you an earful

900
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,232
if he smells anything, you know?

901
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,817
Right.

902
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,654
I replaced the IV line since she had
to change her clothes. Please check.

903
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,450
I'm sorry.

904
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,078
I was the only one who didn't help.

905
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,413
I was just doing my job.

906
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,208
You should go get changed.

907
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,502
I'll finish up here.

908
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,630
Oh, but the professor will be here soon.

909
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,882
Hello.

910
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,883
Hello.

911
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,094
What happened?

912
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,222
I prescribed her metoclopramide
due to severe nausea.

913
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,808
We replaced the IV line,
so I'm about to restart the pump.

914
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,017
What's the ANC?

915
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,854
Pardon? Right, it's…

916
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,774
It's 2,500.

917
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,775
Okay.

918
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,988
Your immune function pre-chemo looks good.

919
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:42,158
You're experiencing side effects
like nausea and digestive issues.

920
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:46,746
But you'll feel significantly better
if we use antiemetics appropriately.

921
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,042
If it's too difficult for you,
we can apply an antiemetic patch.

922
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,086
Okay, I understand.

923
00:52:55,171 --> 00:53:00,385
OH YI-YOUNG, EMAIL ME THE REFERENCES

924
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,739
Did you get scolded badly?

925
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,994
Nam-kyung said
Professor Seo really gave you an earful.

926
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,121
Right.

927
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,707
She said you might even quit.

928
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,500
I deserved it.

929
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,934
Yi-young, listen.

930
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,605
The professor left a note for you.

931
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,610
Let's get it done right now.
She needs materials on--

932
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,528
Preterm labor research references.

933
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,657
I emailed them to her.

934
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,534
Really? How?

935
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,662
How did you know?

936
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,626
Did you see?

937
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:16,920
Yes.

938
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,506
It was on the monitor.

939
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,551
Someone must've put it back
after it fell.

940
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,927
It was really dirty.

941
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,765
I need water.

942
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,369
You know what?

943
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,127
I'll tell you why I got scolded again.

944
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,423
A 20-week pregnant patient,
Ms. Hwangbo Bo-hyeon.

945
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,886
We couldn't do an amniotic fluid test
since her water broke.

946
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,472
So we decided to do a different test.

947
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,476
But they told me to do it.

948
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,520
So…

949
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,648
I said I couldn't do it.

950
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,276
And then, I got chewed out.

951
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,194
Why?

952
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:05,987
Why did you refuse?

953
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,031
It's a good opportunity.

954
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,201
The professor trusted you enough
to give you a chance, so you should do it.

955
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,119
I mean…

956
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,580
I'm not saying it's good news.

957
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,541
But it can help the patient
with her future pregnancies

958
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,086
and be used as a research case.

959
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,420
Plus, it's a rare case.

960
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:26,007
You get to learn, so that's good.

961
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,096
It's for the patient and her future baby.

962
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,098
You need to do it well.

963
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,352
What's this? Am I talking to Seo Jung-min?

964
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,404
So I'm going to do it now.

965
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,741
She's being induced and will deliver soon.

966
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,536
Speaking of which…

967
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,581
Let's do it together.

968
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,421
I'm scared.

969
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,058
Please help me.

970
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,035
Push on your lower abdomen,
and it'll hurt less.

971
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,789
Yes, just a little more.

972
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,291
A little more.

973
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,670
It's out.

974
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,007
Well done, ma'am.

975
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,552
Now, we just need the placenta
to come out properly.

976
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,137
Hang in there.

977
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,232
Dr. Oh, I'll leave it to you.

978
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,027
Ultrasound, please.

979
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,028
Yes, ma'am.

980
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,529
- Nurse Ji-young.
- Yes, ma'am.

981
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,116
How are you feeling right now?

982
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,076
Are you all right?

983
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,578
Yes.

984
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,213
Wait.

985
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,174
The baby…

986
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,774
<i>I…</i>

987
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,110
<i>I don't think I can do that test.</i>

988
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,028
And also…

989
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,032
I can't do it alone.

990
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,325
Then what should we do?

991
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,412
We have three surgeries right now,
and Do-won is going into surgery too.

992
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,749
Should we take the attending doctor off
and ask someone else?

993
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,585
Dr. Oh.

994
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,547
Whether we can do it or not
isn't for us to decide.

995
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,925
The person struggling the most
right now is the patient,

996
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:17,428
and she made the difficult decision
to go through with this.

997
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,016
If it's for the mother and her baby,
we do it.

998
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,560
That's not an acceptable excuse.

999
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,937
But…

1000
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,150
Okay. I'm sorry.

1001
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,321
Ms. Hwangbo is starting to dilate,

1002
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,823
so keep a close eye on her.

1003
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,284
Call me when the delivery room is ready.

1004
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,160
Make sure the adjacent room
is also prepared.

1005
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,166
Good luck.

1006
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,509
Oh Yi-young.

1007
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,263
Do you have coins?

1008
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,144
Tell me.

1009
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,230
I saw this when I was an intern.

1010
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,150
She was a second-year resident.

1011
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,070
She couldn't sleep for days
after doing the test.

1012
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,865
She cried a lot.

1013
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,242
She sobbed and said

1014
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,953
she knew we couldn't save it.

1015
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,206
But she was hesitant to do it
to such a tiny body.

1016
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,792
She didn't want to cause any pain.

1017
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,629
After that incident,

1018
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,965
her heart would race
whenever she saw a baby.

1019
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,301
She couldn't even look at pregnant women.

1020
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,472
That's why I'm hesitant.

1021
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,437
It's not that I don't want to do it.

1022
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,321
I felt the same way.

1023
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,659
At 20 weeks…

1024
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,121
It really looked like a baby, you know?

1025
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,752
When it first came out,
it took a few last breaths.

1026
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,173
It even moved a bit
right there in my hands.

1027
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,221
It was truly terrifying.

1028
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,017
But what can we do?

1029
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,228
Still…

1030
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,813
We have to do it.

1031
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,232
That's why we're here.

1032
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,325
There is a cheat code I use
when I'm scared and terrified.

1033
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,793
I'm not sure if you have it though.

1034
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,134
DELIVERY ROOM 2

1035
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,857
DELIVERY ROOM 1

1036
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,964
The professor asked me
to relay the message again.

1037
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,717
She said you need to take
about 1 cm of the baby's skin tissue.

1038
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,470
If you put it in this container,
I'll submit it to DLM right away.

1039
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,929
DEPARTMENT OF LABORATORY MEDICINE

1040
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,482
Should we begin?

1041
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,402
Wait.

1042
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,698
It moved a bit back there.

1043
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,408
It even breathed slightly.

1044
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,327
That can happen.

1045
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,665
But a 20-week-old baby
can't be saved even with CPR.

1046
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,793
The organs aren't mature enough
to sustain life.

1047
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,336
Spontaneous breathing is impossible.

1048
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,253
But…

1049
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,509
What if I'm wrong and this is a mistake?

1050
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,858
This isn't from a textbook, but…

1051
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,237
I thought of something
since you said you were scared.

1052
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,326
CURRENT TIME

1053
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:56,207
May 17, 2023, 6:12 p.m.

1054
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,625
A beautiful baby

1055
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,962
went to a better place.

1056
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,392
Your mom said…

1057
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,021
she'd be waiting for you.

1058
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,492
Heal your wounds…

1059
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,621
in heaven.

1060
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,500
Then come back healthy again.

1061
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,426
I'm sorry.

1062
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,713
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1063

HWANGBO
SUPERVISING PROFESSOR: SEO JUNG-MIN

1064
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,770
What are you doing here?

1065
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,148
You didn't have to come in person.

1066
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,776
This is the second time.

1067
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,111
For both her and you.

1068
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,741
It's always better to have company
when you're scared.

1069
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,328
You're right.

1070
01:05:58,996 --> 01:05:59,830
But…

1071
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,543
she's all alone once again.

1072
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,636
That's why I told you to come to CS.

1073
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,311
Go in.

1074
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:24,814
I will.

1075
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,233
And lighten up.

1076
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:36,450
Don't leave.

1077
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,803
The test wasn't painful
for the baby, was it?

1078
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:56,721
No.

1079
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,308
The biopsy was successful,
and we sent it for genetic testing.

1080
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:05,855
It's a specialized test, so it'll take
about a month to get the results.

1081
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,153
I'm sorry it had to be this way again,

1082
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,780
but recurring abnormalities

1083
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,116
may have genetic factors.

1084
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,869
So we need to check
for the possibility of recurrence.

1085
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,247
This is still considered childbirth,

1086
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,459
so breast milk may be produced,
or you might have breast engorgement.

1087
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,629
And due to hormonal changes,
she may experience postpartum depression.

1088
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,631
Please pay close attention to her.

1089
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,592
Okay.

1090
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,846
And, ma'am…

1091
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,860
Cry as much as you want today.

1092
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:55,946
Next time,

1093
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,324
let's make sure

1094
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,494
we hear a healthy, strong baby cry.

1095
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,860
Gosh, I'm so popular.

1096
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,237
I was less popular as an idol.

1097
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,154
What's that?

1098
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,906
Don't people line up for those bagels?

1099
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,366
Exactly.

1100
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:43,744
This is practically a proposal, isn't it?

1101
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,873
Are you sure we can eat that?
They were given to you.

1102
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,334
They were given to us.

1103
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,629
Right. I should've brought
some coffee too.

1104
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,302
I got them on a late night discount.

1105
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,346
Hey, that's my favorite.

1106
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,851
I heard you had a sweet tooth.

1107
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,479
If you prefer something else--

1108
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,564
You're right.

1109
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,691
Thank you, Doctor.

1110
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,192
You're welcome.

1111
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,028
Good work today.

1112
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,738
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

1113
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,532
Thank you.

1114
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,294
- Hey.
- Yes?

1115
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:37,047
What is it?

1116
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:42,178
Don't tell anyone about Nurse Ju-yeon.

1117
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,389
Don't tell what? Did something happen?

1118
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,766
What? No, nothing happened.

1119
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,852
They're dancing in perfect coordination.

1120
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,354
Hey, aren't you hungry?

1121
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,439
I am.

1122
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,440
Should we eat…

1123
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,525
Never mind.

1124
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,568
We can eat together.

1125
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,196
Really? Seriously?

1126
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,907
What should we get?
What do you like? I like everything.

1127
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,241
But I'm on call.

1128
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,951
Who cares? We can eat here.

1129
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,953
Why are you so excited?

1130
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,415
How could I not be? We're eating together.
Hey, let's ask the others too.

1131
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,500
Hurry up. We don't have much time.

1132
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,940
- Thanks--
- Sorry--

1133
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,154
Thanks for staying this late.

1134
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,324
I didn't do much, really.

1135
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,289
I'm sorry, but don't ask why.

1136
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,128
Okay. I'm not curious anyway.

1137
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,176
Yi-young.

1138
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,429
Aren't you hungry?

1139
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:10,683
Well…

1140
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:17,564
Guys! We're going to get food.
Come join us. Okay?

1141
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:18,732
Should we?

1142
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:31,412
Let's go.

1143
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,122
Awesome!

1144
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,126
Are you really that happy?

1145
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,628
Yes! I always ate alone after work.

1146
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:43,257
Guys, let's get the most delicious dish
in the cafeteria.

1147
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,550
And what's that?

1148
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,260
- Bulgogi beef set!
- Bulgogi beef set!

1149
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:48,762
Nice! Let's go have some!

1150
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,014
- All right.
- Hurry up!

1151
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,062
My phone.

1152
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,290
Who's on duty today?

1153
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,167
- Dr. Pyo Nam-kyung.
- I see.

1154
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,752
We had four GYN patients at the ER,

1155
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,338
so she had a really tough time
making urgent calls.

1156
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,922
I told her to get some rest.

1157
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:24,923
Okay.

1158
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,509
Right, the professor said

1159
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,553
Ms. Cho Min-ae
could have small sips of water,

1160
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,055
but the order hasn't been entered.

1161
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,139
I see.

1162
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:36,185
She's sleeping anyway, so could you
please check on it before morning?

1163
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,356
Okay. I'll notify Dr. Pyo
about everything at once in the morning.

1164
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,025
- Let me check on Ms. Lee Hyo-sun.
- Sure.

1165
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,575
Pyo Nam-kyung speaking.

1166
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,370
Doctor, were you sleeping?

1167
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:57,664
Oh, I didn't know.

1168
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,626
It's about Ms. Cho Min-ae.

1169
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,920
The professor said
she could have water during rounds.

1170
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,546
Can she have some now?

1171
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,632
Yes, water.

1172
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,303
Okay. Please put in the order right away.

1173
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:13,639
Goodbye.

1174
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,737
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST,
JUNG KYUNG-HO, OUR ETERNAL KIM JUN-WAN

1175
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:14,199
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1176
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,492
<i>- Cheers!</i>
<i>- Cheers!</i>

1177
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,494
<i>Weren't you</i>
<i>in the Yulje OB-GYN get-together?</i>

1178
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,621
<i>Did you make any mistakes while drinking?</i>

1179
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,040
<i>Of course not. How old do you think I am?</i>

1180
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,542
Don't, don't, don't.

1181
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,294
What?

1182
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,379
<i>It's okay. I'm just really curious.</i>

1183
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,422
That's interesting.

1184
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:29,840
<i>What did I say about drinking?</i>

1185
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,508
Did you watch your mouth or not?

1186
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:33,594
<i>Did you get home safe?</i>

1187
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,057
<i>He failed today too.</i>

1188
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,017
I'm sorry.

1189
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,978
The patients are upset.

1190
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,564
<i>Professor Seo's patients</i>
<i>are taken care of. Why are mine not?</i>

1191
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,483
What's wrong with you all?

1192
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,401
<i>I'll check on it. I'm sorry.</i>

1193
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,738
It's unlike them to miss things.
I'll scold them properly today.

1194
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,740
<i>Does she think</i>
<i>you have nothing better to do?</i>

1195
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,575
<i>Aren't you here to ask me for a favor too?</i>

1196
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,202
Would the workload be too much then?

1197
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,122
<i>I did make a mistake,</i>
<i>but he said he couldn't do it.</i>

1198
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,082
<i>The least he could've done was keep quiet.</i>

1199
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,334
<i>Can't you control your anger?</i>

1200
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,544
<i>- Do you have to lash out to feel better?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1201
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:08,462
Hey!

1202
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,549
<i>Wasting others' time</i>
