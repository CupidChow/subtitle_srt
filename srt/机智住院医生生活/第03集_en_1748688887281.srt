RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,313
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,859
Goodness.

4
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,244
All right. Gosh.

5
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,212
Get up.

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,839
I'm folding laundry here.

7
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,923
Can't you see?

8
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,383
Geez. You little…

9
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,637
Why fold them
when I'm going to wear them anyway?

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,308
Aren't you going to do the dishes?

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,143
Later.

12
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,103
I'll do them after we have dinner.

13
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,356
Did you clean the bathroom?

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,483
I'll do it when I shower.

15
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,027
And the living expenses?

16
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,113
You didn't wire it yesterday.
When will you send it?

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,167
You told me to pay off my debt.

18
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,753
If I had money, I'd give it to you.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,339
You have until tomorrow
before I kick you out.

20
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,008
Joo-young, it's exhausting for me too.

21
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,718
Forcing yourself to work is hard.

22
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,220
And time passes so damn slowly.

23
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,679
Do you act like this outside too?

24
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,390
Do you have that "I hate this" expression

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,560
and say the most despicable things
at the hospital too?

26
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,521
I'm not like this at work.

27
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,399
Right? You're being professional,
aren't you?

28
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,737
No, I'm not. I can't be like that at all.

29
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,864
Speaking of which…

30
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,493
Can you buy me an outfit
so I can be more professional?

31
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,578
Don't be ridiculous.

32
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:05,125
Hey, your brother-in-law wears his shirts
until the collars are frayed.

33
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,960
Beggars can't be choosers. Geez.

34
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,922
Do-won is home.
It's Seung-won.

35
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,173
You should exercise too

36
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,259
instead of lying around
like a zombie every Sunday.

37
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,178
I'll end up in the ER
if I work out like them.

38
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,556
Seung-won, you got a package.

39
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,474
I put it on the vanity in your bedroom.
I see.

40
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,688
Should we eat out tonight?

41
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,605
Eat out?

42
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,150
Should we? All of us together for once?

43
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,820
To celebrate my first paycheck,
I'll treat you to frozen pork belly.

44
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,946
It's Seung-won's favorite.

45
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,532
I prefer pork neck.
Do-won is the one who likes it.

46
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,367
Oh, is that so?

47
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,536
We have similar taste.

48
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,580
Joo-young, we're out of bottled water.

49
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,832
There's no beer either.
I'll buy some on my way back.

50
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,334
You're leaving? What about dinner?
And the pork belly?

51
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,378
I need to go to the hospital.
Why?

52
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,256
Why ask? He must have work to do.

53
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,466
But it's Sunday.
Why does he need to work today?

54
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:56,968
Sir?

55
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,846
Sorry. It just turned out that way.

56
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,514
What about the pork belly?

57
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,058
You guys can eat without me.

58
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:04,976
Should we?

59
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,894
Let's do that.

60
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,646
We can't say no if it's Yi-young's treat.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,274
I have plans.

62
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,026
What?

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,986
I have dinner plans too.

64
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,738
Didn't you want pork belly?

65
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,072
When did I say that?

66
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,782
You little brat!

67
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,380
Are you really meeting someone
at the hospital on a Sunday?

68
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,423
Yes, I am.

69
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,592
It just turned out that way.

70
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,845
Want to listen to music?

71
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,472
Sure.

72
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,351
Go ahead.

73
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,145
I thought you'd play it.

74
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,272
No, I don't really listen to music.

75
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,191
I meant you could play it if you're bored.

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,694
I see. You don't like music.

77
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,781
I like bread.

78
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,742
White bread, red bean bread,
cream bread, streusel bread, everything.

79
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,828
I like tteokbokki and gimbap,
but I'm not a fan of sundae.

80
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,874
I love getting massages
and hate running, walking, and hiking.

81
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,293
But I'm good at swimming.
I was on the Dolphin Swim Team.

82
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,504
That's why I prefer the ocean
to the mountains.

83
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,174
Am I being too chatty?
Am I distracting you?

84
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,759
It's okay. I wasn't listening anyway.

85
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,179
There's less traffic on Sundays.

86
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,100
I was almost late for work yesterday
due to severe traffic.

87
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,480
Why are you going
to the hospital on a Sunday?

88
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,733
I'm supposed to work
on a paper with Dr. Myeong.

89
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,443
We need to review some charts.

90
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,529
There's absolutely no time on weekdays,

91
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,572
so weekends are the only time
I can do research.

92
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,492
Why did you agree to do it with her?
You should've said no.

93
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,660
How could I?

94
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,744
You should have.

95
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,164
Get your head on straight.

96
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,458
Before you know it,
you'll be doing it all by yourself.

97
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,835
I doubt it.

98
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,420
Gosh, this is frustrating.

99
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,549
It won't be easy,
but I think it'll be helpful for me.

100
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,469
And she'll list me as the first author,
so why would I refuse?

101
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,515
Do you think being called a yes-man
or a team player is a compliment?

102
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,475
Those are different nicknames
for a pushover.

103
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,645
That's why they call me
Do-won the Pushover.

104
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,563
Funny, right?

105
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
Sometimes when I look at you, I think…

106
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,321
That I'm handsome?
Yes.

107
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,490
What? No.

108
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,409
Are you crazy? What are you saying?

109
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,745
Sometimes when I look at you, I think…

110
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,830
That I'm pretty?

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,041
You're really funny.

112
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,501
You're the funniest woman I've ever met.

113
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,339
What do you mean? I've never been funny.

114
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,798
What's so funny about me?

115
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,759
See? You're funny.

116
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,095
The way you talk, your reactions…

117
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,647
Are you okay?

118
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,277
No, I'm not okay.

119
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,547
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

120
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:24,967
Thank you.

121
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,180
Hello.

122
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,853
Did you sleep well?

123
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,022
We were on call, so we stayed up.

124
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:39,899
I see.

125
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,235
Jae-il, why are you here so early?

126
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,028
Well, I--

127
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,948
First-years have a lot to do
in the morning.

128
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,118
They're still a bit slow,
so it takes longer to do things.

129
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,371
Yes, she's right.

130
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,123
You're working hard.

131
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,250
They say the first year is the toughest.

132
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,919
But guess what?

133
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,046
The second year is even harder.

134
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,216
And the third year makes
the second look easy. Okay?

135
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,718
Today will be tough once again.
Every day is tough.

136
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,682
Shall we go then?

137
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,683
Okay.

138
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,394
Right. I saw Dr. Ku.
Should we get him some coffee?

139
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,022
He already had some 30 minutes ago.

140
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,568
He's probably basking in the sun
on the bench in front of the stairs now.

141
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,777
How do you know that?

142
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,490
Everyone in OB-GYN probably knows
where and what he's doing by the hour.

143
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,413
He's the first to show up for breakfast
at 5:00 a.m. before work.

144
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,372
Good morning.

145
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,041
He goes to the basement convenience store
during surgery breaks,

146
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,170
eats a red-bean bun, and downs some coffee
before working again.

147
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,547
His meals always follow a clockwise order.

148
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,716
Korean snack food, Chinese the next day,

149
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,635
Western food the day after, and then--

150
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,095
Korean snack food.
Correct.

151
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,014
Mondays, he's at the gym
across the hospital.

152
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,016
Wednesdays, he plays tennis
across the hospital.

153
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,601
Then he comes back here.

154
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,438
Gosh, he's really living
a "that guy" lifestyle with that routine.

155
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,566
I wouldn't say "that guy."

156
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,318
He's pretty much living at the hospital.

157
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,112
"That doctor"?

158
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,530
"That doctor"?

159
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,450
Shall we?
Let's go.

160
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,454
Let me.
It's okay.

161
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,455
Let me.

162
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,248
Give it to me.

163
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,429
Good morning.

164
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,517
What are you wearing?
What?

165
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,729
Hey, Shoulder Pads. Will you fit in there?

166
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:45,942
Geez.

167
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,703
Please wait.

168
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,253
Excuse me.

169
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,755
Fifth floor, right?

170
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,798
Yes.

171
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,217
Thank you.

172
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,301
You're welcome.

173
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,691
What was that for?

174
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,877
I really don't like workplace romances.

175
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,879
What are you saying?

176
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,590
That doctor seems to like me.

177
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,300
Really? Seriously?

178
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,177
I seriously doubt it.
I'm telling you.

179
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,013
I see. I'm going first.

180
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,848
Oh, come on.

181
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,016
I'm positive.

182
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,996
Stop looking back all the time.

183
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,457
Someone might think
you have a crush on them.

184
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,750
Did I do that?

185
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,543
Yesterday at the café,

186
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,920
you kept glancing
when we were with our colleagues.

187
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,464
Geez.

188
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,633
Do you like me that much?
Yes.

189
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,179
I didn't realize I was being so obvious.

190
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,933
Professor Yong Seok-min.

191
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,436
It's the same short white coat,
but I sense a different vibe.

192
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,897
What do you mean? I haven't changed.

193
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,193
Geez. I'm the youngest professor.
An underling.

194
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,072
Are you writing another paper?

195
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,573
You've been writing so many.

196
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,866
There's a lot to study.

197
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,162
I need to go as soon as I get the data.
Professor Chae Song-hwa is waiting.

198
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,832
Actually, she called earlier this morning.

199
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,211
She told me
to make sure you eat before you go

200
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,671
even if you used her as an excuse.

201
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,839
Really?
Yes.

202
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,675
She's really the Ghost.

203
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,344
I'm so touched. My heart's fluttering.

204
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,846
Your heart should only flutter for me.

205
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,806
Come on.

206
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,849
What? Too cheesy?

207
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,019
No. You really made my heart flutter.

208
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,238
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

209
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,447
Are they dating?

210
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,158
How did he know
I was going to the fifth floor?

211
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,576
How long has this been going on?

212
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,204
That's where the residents' office is.
Where else would you go?

213
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,997
This wasn't the first time.

214
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,542
Yesterday, we ran into each other
at a café during lunchtime.

215
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,960
We always go there after lunch--

216
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,796
He was drinking coffee then looked at me
as if mesmerized, and smiled.

217
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,424
As he was leaving,
he turned to look at me and smiled again.

218
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,134
Maybe you're funny-looking to him.

219
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,761
Even today.
How did we just meet right there?

220
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,722
I think he timed it.

221
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,058
Go ask him if he likes you.

222
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,227
Why ask? It's so obvious.

223
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,186
What do you mean?

224
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,855
He kept looking and smiling.

225
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,399
His body reacts before his mind does.

226
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,608
What else could it be?

227
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,279
It's love.

228
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,906
Love isn't something you say with words.

229
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,159
Your body just reacts
without you even realizing it.

230
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,578
It's like an uncontrollable sneeze.

231
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,500
Gosh, did I catch a cold?

232
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,047
The residents' meeting
is at 6:30 a.m., right?

233
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,884
There's so much work,
so why are we doing it so early?

234
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,219
We have to.
I have more than a few things to bring up.

235
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,472
Look at these scrubs.

236
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,057
I washed them so many times
the pants are fraying at the hem.

237
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,143
And the on-call pay.

238
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,770
Isn't this pretty much labor exploitation?

239
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,148
It's absurd how the pay
hasn't increased for years.

240
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,942
That's not what we're discussing today.

241
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,530
Then what? What are we discussing?

242
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,242
Do you really not know?
Do you have no idea?

243
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,660
What's the topic?

244
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,245
You.

245
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,584
These are just
some of the countless reports.

246
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,586
It's just the tip of the iceberg.

247
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,422
"Case one."

248
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,925
"April 22, Professor Jo Joon-mo."

249
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,511
"Shouted due to delayed GS arrangement."

250
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,304
Who was responsible?

251
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,097
He wasn't exactly shouting.

252
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,727
He was just a bit irritated.

253
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,189
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,902
"Case two.
April 24, Professor Jo Joon-mo."

255
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,947
"Was extremely furious
and gave the resident an earful

256
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,283
due to delayed patient echocardiogram."

257
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,701
Was this you again?

258
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,954
I immediately apologized.

259
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,915
She's always quick to apologize.
Be quiet.

260
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,167
This is why
we have to have these meetings.

261
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,047
Professor Jo is known for having
the shortest temper in our hospital.

262
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,800
He hates delays
more than anything in the world.

263
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,885
You can't even get that right?

264
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,178
Yes, I understand!

265
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,183
Dr. Oh isn't the only problem here.

266
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,645
Let me point out a few issues
with you first-years.

267
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,481
You don't properly greet your seniors.

268
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,483
Whenever things get a little hard,
you show it.

269
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,694
If you're going to work anyway,

270
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,364
can't you respond with a smile
when asked to do something?

271
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,907
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,869
Gosh, she's the scariest type of fogey.

273
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,203
A young fogey.

274
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,623
Dr. Oh?

275
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,001
Can you do it?

276
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,878
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,092
But…

278
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,178
How can we not show
we're struggling when it's hard?

279
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,265
What did you say?

280
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,102
I mean, we don't want to show it either.

281
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,604
But

282
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,899
it just shows on our faces.

283
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,905
Wasn't the study group at 7:00 a.m.?
Why are you here so early?

284
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,741
Have you eaten?
Have our first-years eaten yet?

285
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,993
Hello, Dr. Ku.
Hey.

286
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,286
What were you up to?

287
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,040
Da-hye.

288
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,291
Yes?

289
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,002
Don't tell me
you've revived the residents' meeting.

290
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,341
That kind of uncivilized
public execution is forbidden.

291
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,302
I worked hard to abolish that,

292
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,387
so don't hold such meetings

293
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,640
and don't attend them either.

294
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,183
Understood?

295
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,268
Yes, we understand.

296
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,812
Say, "Yes, sir."

297
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,857
Yes, sir.

298
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,487
Right.

299
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:54,161
A patient left this at the ward.

300
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,707
It's for a male resident,
and since it's not me…

301
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,251
Look at you, Um Jay!

302
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,670
Me? Is that for me?

303
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,546
She asked me to tell you
she's very grateful.

304
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,925
She wanted to compliment you
and even wrote down your name.

305
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,304
Professor Seo was elated
and bought us this food.

306
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,974
Thanks, Um Jay.
My pleasure.

307
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,184
She's Cho-rong's mom from Mapo
who runs a flower shop,

308
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,560
and her husband is a car dealer.

309
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,478
Yes, that's her.

310
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,272
If he gets featured
on the Compliment Board,

311
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,400
wouldn't he be the first
among OB-GYN first-years?

312
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,151
That's right.
What?

313
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,486
Even I've never done that.

314
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,196
"The first"? Really?

315
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,614
Probably.

316
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,866
Congratulations.
Congrats.

317
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,995
It hasn't happened yet.
I'll congratulate you once it's official.

318
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,455
Sure. Do as you please.

319
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,917
I thought it'd be Sa-bi for sure.

320
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,920
Making it to the board won't affect

321
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,007
the medical knowledge assessment
or research evaluation.

322
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,050
But isn't it helpful
for the residency evaluation?

323
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,094
The mid-year evaluation is coming up.

324
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,096
I doubt the professors care that much.

325
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,808
My friend's hospital gives
a 20,000-won coffee voucher for it.

326
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,893
That's not the point.

327
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,605
The fact is that
a patient found comfort in what I said.

328
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,608
They said not to get
too emotionally invested in our patients…

329
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,987
But you could do a bit of that.

330
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,988
What did you do?

331
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,034
Well… I put my heart into it
when dealing with my patients.

332
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,621
I empathize with their feelings
and always make sure to speak warmly.

333
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,915
I realized words are crucial--

334
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,833
I see.

335
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,251
I have to go.

336
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,169
But…

337
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,881
I thought it was something profound.
See you.

338
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,716
Isn't this profound?

339
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,177
It was a pro tip.

340
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,470
Speak warmly, was it?

341
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,057
If I do that,
will I also be featured on the board?

342
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,974
You bet.

343
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,728
"Ms. Patient."

344
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,022
"Ma'am."

345
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,032
EXAMINATION ROOM
ATTENDING DOCTOR: JO JOON-MO

346
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,251
This is our first time
being referred to a big hospital.

347
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,176
You've probably already heard,

348
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,056
but the biopsy results
confirm endometrial cancer.

349
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,809
The cancer in the uterus is quite large,

350
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,895
so preserving the uterus
will be difficult.

351
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,444
I heard it might've spread to the ovaries.
Is that true?

352
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,448
Yes, there are masses on both ovaries.

353
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,699
But we can't determine

354
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,538
if they're metastasized cancer
or just simple cysts.

355
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,292
A pre-surgery biopsy
of the ovaries is impossible,

356
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,797
so we'll need to perform a biopsy
during the surgery to know for certain.

357
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,133
I mean…

358
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,344
Cancer?

359
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,305
I'm sorry, Doctor.

360
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,808
My mom hasn't come to terms
with this just yet.

361
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,976
That's okay.

362
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,730
First, you'll need to be admitted
and get MRI and CT scans.

363
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,899
Then we'll schedule your surgery
as soon as possible

364
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,986
to get a better look at the ovaries.

365
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,490
Ms. Geum Seon-mi?

366
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,369
Yes, that's me.

367
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,288
Let's begin the MRI scan.

368
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,414
Okay, I'm coming.

369
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,916
Mom.

370
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,669
I just need some tests and surgery.

371
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,046
Okay.

372
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,882
I've been fasting in preparation.

373
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,467
I was worried
I wouldn't be able to get the tests done.

374
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,803
But we're getting the MRI right away, see?

375
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
I'm relieved.

376
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,851
Mom, I'm fine. Okay?

377
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,145
I'm fine, so why are you crying?

378
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,524
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

379
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,360
Check Ms. Geum's symptoms thoroughly.

380
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,280
Check when and how frequently
the irregular bleeding occurred.

381
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,865
Yes, sir.

382
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,456
There you go again.

383
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,125
Oh, it's just my hobby.

384
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,002
You know that.

385
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,589
She must be tense
since the surgery was moved up suddenly.

386
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,424
Go comfort her well.

387
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
I'm not good at comforting.

388
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,431
Explain things well and visit her
frequently as her attending doctor.

389
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,266
Showing that you care is comforting.

390
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,437
Yes, sir.

391
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,234
By the way…

392
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,612
The patient was very brave,
but her mother was…

393
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,200
She cried for over 30 minutes
after leaving the examination room.

394
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,244
I tried to explain everything,

395
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,829
but she barely listened.

396
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,166
In that case…

397
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,503
Explain well to the guardian

398
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,047
and visit her frequently
as the attending doctor.

399
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,050
Showing that you--
"Showing that you care is comforting."

400
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,760
You know it well.
Tell me.

401
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,221
How exactly do I do that?
I really don't know.

402
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,348
How am I supposed to teach you?
Even I don't know.

403
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,186
Yes, I'm coming.

404
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,357
Work hard.

405
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,655
I read online

406
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,574
that there's a new targeted therapy.

407
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,953
Could that apply to me?

408
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,918
A new chemotherapy drug?
Yes.

409
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,213
Maybe the current drug is too strong.

410
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,800
My body feels so weak,
and I have no energy.

411
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,844
I wonder if it's because of the drug.

412
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,845
Am I right?

413
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,889
You see, I'm still a first-year resident.

414
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,517
I'll ask and get back to you right away.

415
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,311
Goodness.

416
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:57,024
How do you know
even less than your patient?

417
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,029
Hello, ma'am.
Hello.

418
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,072
Oh, my.
It's tough, isn't it?

419
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,490
Goodness.

420
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,201
Physical strength is crucial
during chemotherapy.

421
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,537
You need to eat well and exercise a lot.

422
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,250
You look better
than when you came three weeks ago.

423
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,003
I was worried
I wouldn't see you before leaving.

424
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,797
Right, Doctor.

425
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,844
Strangely, I feel especially weak
and have no energy.

426
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,180
I really feel like I'm dying.

427
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,058
Ma'am, you barely ate yesterday,
didn't you?

428
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,435
My mouth tastes bitter, so what can I do?

429
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,228
I'm sick of hospital food.

430
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,524
Still, you need to eat and exercise a lot.

431
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,568
That's the best thing you can do. Okay?

432
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,446
All right. I will.

433
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,364
I'm going to check tomorrow.

434
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,949
Goodness.
To see if you finished your meal.

435
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,701
I said I would.

436
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,454
All right. Stay strong.

437
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,538
Thank you.

438
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,377
Goodness.

439
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,466
Hey, no patient is going to like it

440
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,760
if you stand there
with that "I don't know anything" look.

441
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,387
But what can I do if I really don't know?

442
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:15,060
Everyone in the hospital
already knows that we're idiots.

443
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,606
Even that kind transport attendant,
Mr. Hwang Min-cheol, doesn't trust us.

444
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,402
There's absolutely no one here
who trusts first-year residents.

445
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,407
This is the advanced version
of the tip I mentioned earlier.

446
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,994
Gosh. Should I tell you or not?

447
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,790
Go ahead. I'll give it a listen.

448
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,376
"Eat well and exercise a lot."

449
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,293
What?

450
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,671
If you're not sure, just say this.

451
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,549
"Eat well and exercise a lot."

452
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:47,884
Is it not true?

453
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,802
It is true.

454
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,847
Eating well and exercising a lot
are shortcuts to good health.

455
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,683
I shouldn't have taken you seriously.

456
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,935
You're just stating the obvious--

457
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:57,853
Hello, Doctor.

458
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,313
Oh, hello.

459
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,232
How's the pain?

460
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,484
It's still a bit uncomfortable.

461
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,861
It's taking some time.

462
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,157
You need to focus on eating well
and exercising a lot.

463
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,908
Did you exercise a lot today?

464
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,785
Not much.
Oh, dear.

465
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,370
That won't do.

466
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,330
Consistency is key.

467
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
Let's walk together.

468
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,501
That would be nice.

469
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,295
I'd be spending
some quality time with you.

470
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,923
Let's walk to the annex.
Okay.

471
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,009
You need to exercise a lot
even when I'm not here.

472
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,553
Yes, I understand.

473
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,638
I'll check on you every single day.

474
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,729
Mom.
Yes?

475
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,647
My hands and feet are fine.

476
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,817
I'm just doing this because I want to.

477
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,570
Oh, right.

478
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,908
They said a window-side bed
might be available tomorrow.

479
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,867
So hang in there.

480
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,953
I like it here. It's close to the hallway.

481
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,290
What's good about it? It's a doorway.

482
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,500
No, it's not.

483
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,087
It's close to the nurses' station,
and the bathroom is right there.

484
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,008
You're so considerate.

485
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,971
You're kindhearted and optimistic, so why…

486
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,890
Here we go again.

487
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,808
Your nose will get chafed.

488
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,103
Hello.
Hello.

489
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,188
Hello.

490
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,940
Is everything okay?

491
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,192
Yes, everything's fine.

492
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,029
Your surgery will probably be
the day after tomorrow in the afternoon.

493
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,656
It's the last slot of the day.

494
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,242
If earlier surgeries are delayed
or there's an emergency,

495
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,701
yours could be pushed back.

496
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,413
Look. She's already fasting today
for the tests.

497
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,375
And she'll be fasting until late
on the surgery day too.

498
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,253
She'll be too weak by then.

499
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,631
Can't the surgery be in the morning?

500
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,467
There are other surgeries
scheduled before hers.

501
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,096
Otherwise, we'd have to postpone the date.
Would you like that?

502
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,558
No, that's okay.
I'll have the surgery as planned.

503
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,476
Okay.

504
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,853
Mom, I'm young. I'll be fine.

505
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,731
You should stop fasting and eat something.

506
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,650
Can you please tell her?

507
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,989
Ma'am, you need to eat to stay healthy.

508
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,782
Please eat.

509
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,993
Don't mind me.

510
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,996
Right, Doctor.

511
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,331
How long will the surgery take?

512
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,918
The hysterectomy alone
takes about an hour and a half.

513
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,672
But it could take up to three hours
if there is ovarian metastasis.

514
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,091
We just did an MRI scan earlier.

515
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,094
Can't you really tell if it has spread?

516
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,472
No, we can't determine that clearly.

517
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,561
But still, it's a major open surgery.

518
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:50,066
But you don't know how long it'll take
or how much you'll need to remove.

519
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,735
That doesn't make sense.

520
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,281
That's often the case in gynecology.

521
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,534
Why is everything like this?

522
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,954
There could be good news too, Mom.

523
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,373
Right, Doctor? My ovaries could be fine.

524
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,792
Well…

525
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,962
I can't tell you
anything definitive right now.

526
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,798
We'll know after the surgery.

527
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,721
You made my mom cry again.

528
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,017
Ms. Yang, stop crying.

529
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,143
Okay.
Okay?

530
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,856
Look, I don't know about all that.

531
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,192
The day after tomorrow, okay?

532
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,778
Just make sure
I can be discharged by then.

533
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,448
Ma'am, I can't guarantee that.
Nothing's for sure right now.

534
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,575
But we need to reinsert your catheter.

535
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,452
Your residual urine is over 400.

536
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,953
Four hundred?

537
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,582
What's that?
Are you talking about my hospital bill?

538
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,418
No, it's the urine left in your bladder.

539
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,254
You're not getting enough urine
out of your body.

540
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,965
Hold on. How do you know that?

541
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,512
Goodness, I must've not flushed.

542
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,013
That's not why.

543
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,102
We'll reinsert the catheter later today.

544
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,895
You can only be discharged

545
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,022
if your residual urine
has decreased by tomorrow.

546
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,273
What should I do?

547
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,984
I have to attend a wedding in three days.

548
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,654
What will I do?

549
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,571
Goodness.

550
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,157
I didn't want any bad luck
before the wedding,

551
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,535
so I didn't even tell
my family about this.

552
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,662
What should I do?

553
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,706
Let's keep this a secret, okay?

554
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,792
I need to attend the wedding.

555
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,796
Doctor, is there any way you can help?

556
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,090
I'd love for you to get discharged.

557
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,677
But a discharge isn't possible
with high residual urine.

558
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,474
Gosh, why isn't my urine
coming out properly?

559
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,520
Then how about you give me some medicine?

560
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,606
Whatever you need to do,
please do it quickly.

561
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,526
I want to leave in three days.
We need to monitor you first.

562
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,736
Why do you need

563
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,947
to monitor my urine again?

564
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,867
It's residual urine, not just urine.

565
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,497
Ma'am.

566
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,834
You're not eating well, are you?

567
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,254
Well, that's because…

568
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,674
How can I eat what you serve here?

569
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,800
I knew it.

570
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,012
Ma'am, you need to eat well
and drink plenty of water.

571
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,515
And exercise. You need to exercise a lot.

572
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,392
That's how you can be discharged.

573
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,102
Are you serious?

574
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,021
Do you think I don't know that?

575
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,233
My stomach hurts from the surgery,
and my knees are aching too.

576
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,529
That's all the more reason
to eat well and exercise a lot.

577
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,700
Okay. I'll do that.

578
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,619
I'll start today…

579
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,789
No, I'll start right now.

580
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,415
Don't worry.

581
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,333
Good.

582
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,338
I'm telling you.

583
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,925
I would've been up all night
with that lady if it weren't for Jae-il.

584
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,178
It's true. It's totally effective.

585
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,808
What's the point of just filling your head
with reading and studying?

586
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,477
The real world isn't just about studying.

587
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,939
I want to try it too,
but I haven't had the chance.

588
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,236
Hello.
Hello.

589
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,115
You guys have become so close now.
You're even getting off work together.

590
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,952
Where are you going?

591
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,036
Home.
Home.

592
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,331
Right. We have homes to go to.

593
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:36,876
Go on then.

594
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,504
Goodbye.

595
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,381
Aren't you guys

596
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,633
hungry?

597
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,885
What?
Food?

598
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,137
Yes. Should we have dinner together?

599
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,975
Is it your treat?

600
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,286
I'm grateful that at least you stayed.

601
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,162
Eat up.

602
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,583
You better be grateful.

603
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,502
Who'd want to stay if someone
offered dinner on their way home?

604
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,171
I made a big mistake.

605
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,299
I really wasn't thinking much.

606
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,095
But I'm glad that they were honest
and asked to take a rain check.

607
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,763
I don't feel bad, and neither do they.

608
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,224
Don't you know Gen Zs?

609
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,976
Of course. I'm a Gen Z too.

610
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,728
No, you're not.

611
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,109
Why aren't you going home?

612
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,278
I need to watch a surgery video.

613
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,326
Why aren't you going home?

614
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,995
You wanted to eat…

615
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,998
I was leaving, you know?

616
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,125
Right. Sorry.

617
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,301
Are you done already?
Yeah.

618
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,510
Take your time.

619
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,638
It's okay. I'm full.

620
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,731
Why ask us to eat with you
if you're going to eat so quickly?

621
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,153
Why come if you wouldn't eat?
Why not leave like a true Gen Z?

622
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,529
I thought we were going out…

623
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,117
I thought we were going somewhere nice.

624
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,828
The cafeteria? Really?

625
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,543
I should apologize again, right?

626
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:45,922
Sorry.

627
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,383
That was so insincere.

628
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,815
Is Hwang Gyeong-ju here?

629
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,776
I'm her dad.
I got a call that she collapsed.

630
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,986
She's over there.

631
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,577
Gyeong-ju, what happened?

632
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,371
Where does it hurt?

633
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,415
Does it hurt a lot?

634
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,458
What's going on?

635
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,838
I'm fine, Dad. It's nothing serious.

636
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,675
Just go back to work.

637
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,759
Go on.

638
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,930
She was fine this morning.
Where is she suddenly hurting?

639
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,432
Does she have appendicitis?

640
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,310
No, that's not it.

641
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,979
Then what is it?

642
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,942
The professor will be here soon.
She just finished a delivery.

643
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,153
Sorry?

644
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,904
Hello.

645
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,449
Are you in a lot of pain?

646
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,160
Let me check your belly.

647
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:16,971
COUNSELING ROOM

648
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,640
I already explained everything
to her and Ms. Geum,

649
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,435
but she wanted another doctor
to explain it again.

650
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,106
You all kept saying you didn't know, so…

651
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,734
I'm just so anxious.

652
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,321
Then let me explain
the procedure again, ma'am.

653
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:34,989
Okay.

654
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,576
First, we'll remove
the suspected ovarian cyst

655
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,703
and send it for emergency biopsy.

656
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,749
Then the endometrial cancer
will be removed through a hysterectomy.

657
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,919
Then depending
on the ovarian biopsy results,

658
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,713
we'll decide
whether to remove the ovaries or not.

659
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,631
I see.

660
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,511
Are there cases
where the ovaries aren't removed

661
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,640
because it's not cancer?

662
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,895
As we mentioned,
we can only determine that during surgery.

663
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,232
I meant if the ovaries were fine.

664
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,859
If her ovaries aren't removed,

665
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,946
does that mean
she can live without hormone therapy?

666
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:19,158
Yes, hormone therapy isn't needed
if only the uterus is removed.

667
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,536
So, after the surgery,

668
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,289
will my daughter be able to study
and work like before

669
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,375
and live a normal life?

670
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:32,755
She'll need chemotherapy
or radiation treatment after the surgery.

671
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,673
I see…

672
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,092
Chemotherapy…
Ma'am.

673
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,803
This is very hard for you, isn't it?

674
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,683
Please tell me something positive.

675
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,936
Tell me things will be okay.

676
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,356
Why is everything so uncertain?

677
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,609
What did my daughter do so wrong?

678
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,575
There needs to be a glimmer of hope

679
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,328
for me to reassure her
that everything will be okay.

680
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,290
That would make me feel less guilty.

681
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,461
Ma'am.

682
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,178
I was wondering who was crying.

683
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,348
Mom, there are people
staring in the hallway.

684
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,977
Is this why you wanted me to take a walk?

685
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,813
Come on.

686
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,233
I told you I'm okay.
People will think someone died.

687
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,279
Don't say such a thing.
That's no way to talk to your mom.

688
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,199
Okay. I get it, so let's go already.

689
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,951
You're starting to embarrass me, Mom.

690
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,287
I'm sorry.

691
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,582
Next time,
please just explain everything to me.

692
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,752
It's so exhausting
to comfort my crying mom.

693
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,879
Okay, Doctor?

694
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,215
I see.

695
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,008
Okay.

696
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,469
What were you thinking?

697
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,888
Hwang Gyeong-ju.

698
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,515
Say something, will you?

699
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,686
You must've thought this through
to have hidden it from me all along.

700
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,689
Gyeong-ju.

701
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,067
You're a freshman in university.

702
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,319
What are you planning to do now?

703
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,032
We've administered
a uterine contraction inhibitor.

704
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,373
We'll monitor you for an hour or two--

705
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,624
Are you not going to talk?

706
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,835
Answer me!

707
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,255
I'll handle it on my own, so just go!

708
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,383
If I go, then what? What if I leave?

709
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,551
Your mom's not coming, so who will?

710
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,303
Who else will come?

711
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,306
God…

712
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,394
Does he know? That crazy son of a…

713
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,564
Does he know about this?

714
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,194
I'm going crazy.

715
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,406
Don't tell me
you're going through this alone.

716
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,323
Do you…

717
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,535
Do you even know whose baby it is?
Dad!

718
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,287
Dad… I mean…

719
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,997
Sir, please calm down--

720
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,081
Give me your phone.

721
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,001
Give it to me!

722
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,504
Gyeong-ju.

723
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,262
Is it you?

724
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,430
Is it?!

725
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,433
You bastard…

726
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,976
Yeong-chan.

727
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:36,981
Are you okay?

728
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,858
Did you wait long?

729
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,654
Shall we begin?

730
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,116
Can you hear the heartbeat?

731
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,247
The baby is growing well at about 2.7 kg.

732
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,666
You've been taking good care of your baby.

733
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,173
That's the baby's head…

734
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,260
Hello?

735
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,433
That's the head.
You can see the eyes and nose clearly.

736
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,769
Right.

737
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,396
I can see them well.

738
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,816
The amniotic fluid volume is appropriate,
and the placenta is in a good position.

739
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,235
The baby's position is also good.

740
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,696
There are no unusual findings for now.

741
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,492
Ta-da.

742
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,370
Ms. Yoon Ae-sin from Haenam gave me these.

743
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,708
Every time we meet, she says
she wishes I could be her son-in-law.

744
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,794
Her daughter visited yesterday.

745
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,464
What? Doesn't she only have two sons?

746
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,511
I see. She must've forgotten
about her daughter.

747
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,262
Come here for a second.

748
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,683
Just ask without expecting much.

749
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,103
What is it?

750
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,777
It's about

751
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,529
a guardian.

752
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,613
Right?

753
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:09,949
See?

754
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,784
I can't believe
you're asking me for advice…

755
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,703
I see.

756
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,997
This is quite tricky.

757
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,291
The patient's father is livid,

758
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,086
and the boyfriend seems suspicious
like he might run away.

759
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,964
Yes, that's what Sa-bi just said.

760
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,759
Things can seem very complicated in OB

761
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,762
since baby issues
overlap with family issues.

762
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,640
But surprisingly,
the solutions are often simple.

763
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,311
A baby's cry.

764
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,022
Think back to your intern days.

765
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:46,068
We tear up and feel emotional
even when a complete stranger gives birth.

766
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,946
So imagine
if it's your own child or grandchild.

767
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,325
Sure, he might be angry with her
and shocked by the situation right now.

768
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,661
But his heart will melt
once he hears the baby's cry.

769
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:01,250
Come to think of it, the dad responded
for the first time and even smiled a bit

770
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,753
when he heard the baby's heartbeat.

771
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,589
That's good then.

772
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,841
The dad… No.

773
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,593
The grandfather… No.

774
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,888
You just need him to hear the baby's cry

775
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,974
and say, "Congratulations,
the baby is so beautiful."

776
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,684
It would be a happy ending.

777
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,810
But the problem is--

778
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,521
The patient's boyfriend.
That's why Sa-bi is here.

779
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,903
Maybe he's scared
because he'll become a dad overnight.

780
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,446
The same goes for moms too.

781
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,573
I know.

782
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,951
But he didn't even know
about the pregnancy,

783
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,536
so he had no time to prepare himself.

784
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,999
Maybe he'll sort out his feelings
and show up by tomorrow.

785
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,211
If he doesn't,
he won't hear the baby's cry.

786
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,797
What's so simple about this solution?
You don't know either.

787
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,840
Why are you mad at me?

788
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,176
You drank my Americano!
Yes, you did!

789
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,970
I'll buy you one tomorrow.

790
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,225
Let's go home. It's way past our shift.

791
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,146
Bye.

792
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,108
You're superfast when it's time to go.
Who's chasing after you?

793
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,908
Where's Oh Yi-young?

794
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,494
Where is she?

795
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,372
Don't tell me
she delayed surgery again and went home.

796
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,084
Damn it.

797
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,176
Hello.

798
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,388
Hello.

799
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,273
What's your problem?

800
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,482
Why are there always delays?

801
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,985
Don't you know
I hate surgical delays more than anything?

802
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,779
I know. I'm sorry.

803
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,197
You and your damn apologies.

804
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,246
What's the reason today that
I have to perform surgery at this hour?

805
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,292
It's a co-op and even urology is waiting.
Do you even know how upset everyone is?

806
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,002
I needed the echocardiogram

807
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,713
and pulmonary function tests done…

808
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,214
What?

809
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,842
I contacted cardiology,

810
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,678
but they told me to wait.

811
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,972
You couldn't even manage
one test schedule properly,

812
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,474
and you're sitting on your hands
because they told you to?!

813
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,437
All I asked
was to get the patient's tests done

814
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,773
and bring her
to the operating room on time!

815
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,151
Is that so difficult?
These are the basics!

816
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,741
If you can't even do this,
it just means you don't want to work.

817
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,618
What is it? Are you going to quit again?

818
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,745
Are you going to give up again?

819
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,497
Excuse me, Doctor.

820
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,208
I need your help.

821
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,255
The IV solution seems to be leaking.

822
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,091
Well…

823
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,429
A nurse will come over
and check it for you soon.

824
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,930
It's a bit urgent.

825
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,893
Maybe Dr. Oh could take a look at it.

826
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,314
Would you like that?

827
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,859
Dr. Oh, go ahead.

828
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,277
Go and check.

829
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:16,862
Bye.

830
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,447
Goodbye.

831
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,747
The professor must be scary.

832
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,374
He's not like that with us.

833
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,085
Yes, a little.

834
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,507
I thought about just walking away,

835
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,134
but you reminded me of my daughter.

836
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,430
No one is good from the get-go.

837
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,809
We all learn from our mistakes.

838
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,186
But I make a lot of them.

839
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,355
Thank you though.

840
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,361
I shouldn't say this
in front of someone who just got scolded…

841
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,990
but you're lucky.

842
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:09,665
You're doing what you want to do,
making mistakes, and getting scolded.

843
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,461
I envy all of that.

844
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,923
If my daughter wasn't sick,

845
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:22,511
she'd be getting scolded
by someone as well.

846
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,265
Then she'd call me

847
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,352
to complain about her boss
and tattle on them.

848
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,068
I only have myself to blame.

849
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,321
I sent her abroad all alone.

850
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,909
I was oblivious to her suffering.

851
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,370
I bragged about her
getting into a good school

852
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,998
and becoming a lawyer.

853
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,794
I don't even deserve to cry.

854
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,427
But I can't help but tear up
every time I look at her.

855
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,023
I'm going to stop crying now.

856
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,985
She's so brave.

857
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,115
And here I am, her mom, crying all day.

858
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,870
I'm going to do all the things
I couldn't do for her from now on.

859
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,583
I'm going to stay right by her side.

860
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,962
I won't let her suffer alone ever again.

861
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,551
It's time I started being a proper mom.

862
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,348
Well…

863
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,184
There's not much I can do for you

864
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,979
but try to find out as quickly as I can

865
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,650
if the cancer has spread to the ovaries.

866
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,239
I'll ask my professor once he calms down.

867
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,450
I appreciate it.

868
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,162
But I don't think that'll be easy.

869
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,415
Look…

870
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,003
Could I ask you for one more favor?

871
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,676
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

872
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,193
Have you decided?

873
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,617
Never mind.

874
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,828
A hot Americano, please.

875
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,288
One hot Americano.

876
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,292
Dr. Ku is treating us.

877
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,086
And one Mega-ricano. Next.

878
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,213
Iced Americano for me.
With an extra shot, please.

879
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,133
Hot Earl Grey tea for me.
Okay.

880
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,386
Plain Pong Crush.

881
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,389
With honey Pong cereal and extra honey.

882
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,854
I'm quitting
if I can't leave on time today.

883
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,607
By the way, are you attending a funeral?

884
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,150
Who passed away?

885
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,694
This is blue-black, not just black.

886
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,112
And it's a new release.

887
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,160
I have a blind date today.

888
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,414
He's 32, and his business
apparently struck gold.

889
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,249
What did he drive again?

890
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,211
Anyway, I really hope it goes well today.

891
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,715
Hey, people are staring!

892
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,384
They're not. Don't worry.

893
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,763
Have you looked in a mirror?

894
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,182
How do you look shabbier with time?

895
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,476
It's as if you suddenly went bankrupt.

896
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,482
Hello?

897
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,983
Okay, we're on our way.

898
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:15,577
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

899
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,748
Your call cannot be connected.
Damn it.

900
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,839
Will Ms. Hwang's guardian
please come to the delivery room?

901
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,007
She's about to deliver.

902
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:29,925
Already?

903
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,552
Ms. Hwang, are you in a lot of pain?

904
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,970
Don't forget to breathe.

905
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,433
Dad, call Yeong-chan…

906
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,935
Okay.

907
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,108
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

908
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,112
IN SURGERY
GUARDIAN WAITING ROOM

909
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,715
Ms. Hwang Gyeong-ju's guardian?

910
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,216
Sir.

911
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,013
What about my daughter? How is she?

912
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,015
Both she and her baby are healthy.

913
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,313
The baby has ten fingers and ten toes
and is breathing well on their own.

914
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:27,941
I see.

915
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,196
Thank you.

916
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,615
You've worked hard.

917
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,368
You'll be able to see her soon
after her post-delivery care.

918
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,620
She'll recover then go to her room--
Just a moment!

919
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,505
I'm sorry.

920
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,841
Why in the world are you so late?

921
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,343
Your immaturity can't be an excuse!

922
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,970
And why was your phone…

923
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,057
Oh, it's dead.

924
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,603
I'm sorry.

925
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,148
I tried to bring my mother,
but I couldn't.

926
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,692
I'm sorry, sir.

927
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,120
She slapped me once,
and that seemed to help her calm down.

928
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,540
I promise to sort things out
with my parents.

929
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,418
I'll convince them and bring them here.

930
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,170
You have my word, sir.

931
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,188
How is Gyeong-ju?

932
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,148
When can I see her?

933
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,526
She's doing fine.
You'll be able to see her soon.

934
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:55,987
Thank you.

935
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,663
RESEARCH CONSENT FORM

936
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,918
Dr. Pyo, you must have plans.

937
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,503
I do. How did you know?

938
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,922
Your makeup looks amazing today,
and you're glowing.

939
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,341
You look like a different person.
I have a blind date.

940
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,135
I see. No wonder you look stunning today.

941
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,972
Your new hairstyle suits you so well.

942
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,266
Everything is perfect
from your makeup to your outfit.

943
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,559
You're flawless.

944
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,145
My hair is the same as always.

945
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,607
What is it?

946
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,861
I have just one favor before you leave.

947
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,370
So tell me. Will I be discharged tomorrow?

948
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,040
I'm afraid we'll need to wait
until tomorrow morning to know for sure.

949
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,418
My urine must be the issue again.

950
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,587
Yes. Goodbye then.

951
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,963
What time in the morning?

952
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,299
Early or late morning?

953
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,343
Well… we'll insert the catheter tonight,

954
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,430
remove it at dawn,
then wait for four hours…

955
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,098
It'd be 9:00 a.m. at the earliest.

956
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,225
No, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.

957
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,852
It'd be 12:00 p.m. at the latest.

958
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,063
The wedding is at 3:00 p.m.,
so I should be able to make it.

959
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,317
You may or may not be able to go.

960
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,819
Goodness. I know that much too.

961
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,738
Goodbye then.
By the way…

962
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:25,160
Your face is blooming like a flower.

963
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,080
Are you going somewhere nice?

964
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,999
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

965
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,501
Make sure to eat and exercise a lot!

966
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,502
Okay.

967
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,758
I have one favor.

968
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,675
No.

969
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,677
An antipyretic
for Ms. Min Bo-ra in Room 1011.

970
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,263
No.
You always say no but end up helping.

971
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,891
If it goes well, I'll hook you up.

972
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,267
I don't think it'll go well.

973
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,896
Do you have the devil's tongue?
I need a charm to ward you off.

974
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,356
It won't work.

975
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,607
Just help me this once.

976
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,984
Ms. Min Bo-ra, okay? An antipyretic.

977
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,196
No.

978
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,827
Min Bo-ra…

979
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,207
Yes, Room 1011.

980
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,628
By the way,

981
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,506
don't they reset the Compliment Board
around the third week?

982
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,507
That's strange.

983
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,010
Hello, sir.

984
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,304
Ms. Geum Seon-mi's work-up is complete.

985
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,473
The surgeries have been
running behind since morning,

986
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,350
so her surgery will proceed at 7:00 p.m.

987
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,685
Goodbye.

988
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,981
Surgery? Who?

989
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,482
Professor Jo Joon-mo?
Yes.

990
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,651
If this surgery is delayed too,
he'll really kill me.

991
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,570
Hey, are you going already?

992
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,781
Her guardian asked for a favor.

993
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:45,782
What is it?

994
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:47,951
Tell me.

995
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,163
She asked you to stay with the patient
from the entrance to the OR

996
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,331
until the anesthesia?

997
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,083
Yes, because she can't enter.

998
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,503
Right, that operating room corridor
is indeed scary.

999
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,673
And she knows you better
than the transport attendant.

1000
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,383
It's not a difficult task anyway.

1001
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,013
Don't tell me
you're going to stay completely silent.

1002
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,974
Then what should I say?

1003
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,392
Anything.

1004
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,978
I can't do that kind of thing.

1005
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,280
In that case…

1006
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,077
I'll be waiting right here,

1007
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,830
so don't worry
and just get a good rest, okay?

1008
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,877
My kind and smart baby.

1009
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,506
Everything will be fine, so don't worry.

1010
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,675
Just trust me.

1011
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,219
Okay. I'm not worried.

1012
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,764
The doctors know what they're doing.

1013
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,393
And it'll take only 1.5 hours
if it's just the uterus.

1014
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,146
Even with the ovarian surgery,
it'll be done in three hours.

1015
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,814
I'll be done in a jiffy.

1016
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,524
An hour and a half.

1017
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,320
It'll be done in an hour and a half.

1018
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:06,946
I know.

1019
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,534
Right, Doctor?

1020
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,287
Right. Yes.

1021
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,248
I'll be back after the surgery.

1022
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,210
Don't be crying out here, okay?

1023
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,503
I won't.

1024
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,755
Why would I cry?

1025
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,758
Everything will be fine after the surgery.

1026
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,138
I'm counting on you, Doctor.

1027
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,058
Okay. We'll head in now.

1028
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,438
I'll be back.

1029
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:49,114
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
EXIT

1030
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,702
What is your name?

1031
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,288
How long have you been fasting?

1032
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,250
SURGERY WAITING ROOM

1033
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,635
We have to verify some things
before you go in.

1034
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,137
What is your name?

1035
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,597
How much longer do I have to wait?

1036
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,683
We just need to verify
your personal information,

1037
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,976
so it won't take long.

1038
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,649
HWANG GYEONG-JU

1039
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,611
Sir, you see…

1040
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,823
I can devote

1041
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,368
my entire life to our child.

1042
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,580
And to Gyeong-ju as well.

1043
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,502
The guardian
of Ms. Hwang Gyeong-ju's baby?

1044
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,337
That's me! I'm the father!

1045
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,729
Were you away today?
You weren't in the room during the day.

1046
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,606
Yes, just briefly.

1047
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,153
I'm so

1048
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,155
happy for you.

1049
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,618
The baby is beautiful.

1050
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,245
Doesn't she take after her mom?

1051
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,042
Her boyfriend seemed really happy too.

1052
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,295
He's already so in love with his baby.

1053
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,549
I'm truly happy for you, sir.

1054
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:40,975
I should be

1055
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,811
happy, shouldn't I?

1056
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,397
Pardon?

1057
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,946
Should I be happy
about becoming a grandfather overnight?

1058
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,827
I know I should be grateful
that the baby was born healthy.

1059
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,956
I know they're being responsible.

1060
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,459
I get that it's a precious life and all.

1061
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,878
I know all that.

1062
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,843
But that baby
who looks exactly like my daughter…

1063
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,931
That innocent baby…

1064
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,185
To me…

1065
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,817
she's like an angel who's come
to make my daughter's life miserable.

1066
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,842
There are a lot of surgeries,
aren't there?

1067
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,678
So many people get surgeries.

1068
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,640
And many of them
have it worse than you, so--

1069
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,726
I know. Misery loves company?

1070
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:07,812
Sorry?

1071
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,231
If that's what you're going for, save it.

1072
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,899
I've heard that too many times.

1073
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,027
Misery loves company? As if.

1074
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,737
I'm the youngest one here.

1075
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,031
I'm the unluckiest of all.

1076
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:24,412
I'll be by your side
throughout the surgery.

1077
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,707
So don't worry.

1078
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,959
Why are you acting out of character?

1079
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,212
Those kinds of words
aren't comforting at all,

1080
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,215
so can't you act like you normally do?

1081
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,677
Someone put you up to this. Am I right?

1082
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,595
Yes.

1083
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,641
He's a colleague of mine. Um Jae-il.

1084
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,938
What's wrong with me?

1085
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:34,774
I'm really fine.

1086
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,160
I'm sorry.

1087
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,624
I'm sorry.

1088
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,056
Ma'am--

1089
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,974
Sir.

1090
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,685
I have a favor to ask.

1091
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,612
CURRENT TIME

1092
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,748
What is it? Are you in pain?

1093
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,624
No, I'm fine.

1094
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,585
Did…

1095
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,755
Did she leave?

1096
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,799
My mom? Yes.
She'll come by again tomorrow.

1097
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,637
She brought baby clothes
and cotton cloths.

1098
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,764
She said you'll need them.

1099
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,558
I see. Please tell her I said thank you.

1100
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:51,559
Okay.

1101
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,148
You're in pain, aren't you?

1102
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,485
Does it hurt a lot?
Should I call the doctor?

1103
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,155
I…

1104
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,242
It's okay.

1105
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,371
Hello.

1106
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,290
Hello.

1107
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:18,836
Here.

1108
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,054
This feels so much better.

1109
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,263
There's more.

1110
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,316
I really feel so much better now.
Thank you.

1111
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,071
Your father had thrown this in the trash.

1112
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,782
I was going to return it to him,

1113
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,326
but the contents seemed to be for you.

1114
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,925
I asked the other mothers
who were being discharged.

1115
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,469
They said you needed these.

1116
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,973
Call me if you need anything else.

1117
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,382
Right.

1118
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,135
Here.

1119
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:51,929
Are you okay?

1120
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,432
Did it hurt a lot?

1121
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,351
It's okay.

1122
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,024
It's okay.

1123
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,331
It's 7:20 p.m.

1124
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,502
Please give her ten more minutes.
Thank you.

1125
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,464
We're okay.

1126
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,883
But what about you?

1127
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,260
Even if we start now,
it'll take at least 30 more minutes.

1128
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:35,139
Professor Jo isn't the type
who'd understand these things.

1129
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,600
You'll get yelled at again.

1130
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,394
I'll tell him myself.

1131
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,573
Sir, I'm calling
about Ms. Geum Seon-mi's surgery.

1132
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,742
Yes, I'll be there
in exactly five minutes.

1133
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,160
We'll start right away.

1134
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,704
Actually, that might not be possible.

1135
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,248
Why? What's the problem now?

1136
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,751
It's me.

1137
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,338
I forgot to do one lab test this morning.

1138
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,508
ABGA.

1139
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,051
ABGA.

1140
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,636
You forgot the ABGA?

1141
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,554
Yes. So…

1142
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,140
Anesthesiology is doing
an emergency ABGA right now,

1143
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,433
but it'll take some time.

1144
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,853
Hey! Where's your head at?

1145
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,106
I have an academic meeting today!

1146
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,150
How many times
did I tell you not to delay this?

1147
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,904
I specifically asked you
not to be late this time.

1148
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,199
Seriously. What is your deal?

1149
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,951
What is wrong with you?!

1150
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,954
I'm really sorry. This won't happen again.

1151
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,205
You idiot!

1152
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,958
Yes, I am an idiot. I'm sorry.

1153
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,429
Thank you.

1154
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,809
Beginning anesthesia.

1155
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,200
SURGERY STATUS

1156
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:23,789
GEUM SEON *: OPERATING ROOM, IN SURGERY

1157
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,598
Oh Yi-young, focus.

1158
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:44,643
You're the reason for this delay,
so why are you checking the time?

1159
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,645
I'm sorry.

1160
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,816
ANESTHESIA TIME, SURGERY TIME

1161
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,485
It's taking longer than usual today.

1162
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,823
It should be here by now.

1163
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,241
This is Pathology.

1164
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,702
Is patient Geum Seon-mi in Room 10?

1165
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,870
Yes, that's correct.

1166
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:05,289
The tissue you sent
is from the ovary, correct?

1167
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,499
Correct.

1168
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,501
From the section we examined…

1169
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:20,763
Explain the results well.

1170
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,099
Stay calm so they won't get shocked…

1171
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,898
If only she prepared for the surgery
at that speed…

1172
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:31,899
SURGERY TIME

1173
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,965
Thank you, Doctor.

1174
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,634
Thank you.

1175
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,969
Thank you so much.

1176
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,607
Stop crying.

1177
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,155
Thank you for your effort.

1178
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,039
I was worried
because the ovarian mass didn't look good,

1179
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,416
but both are benign.

1180
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,418
The bleeding looks fine too.

1181
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,086
I'll finish up here.

1182
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,798
Please count the gauze.

1183
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,724
How have you not gotten permission yet
for tomorrow's first surgery?

1184
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,559
It's the most basic thing.

1185
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:49,935
I'm sorry.

1186
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,438
I'll get it done right away.
Goodbye.

1187
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,347
Ma'am.

1188
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,807
Goodness, you startled me.

1189
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,183
It's nine o'clock.

1190
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:15,354
Goodness, our beautiful doctor
works so hard.

1191
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,397
Are you ready?

1192
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,356
Yes.

1193
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,530
It's okay.

1194
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,075
Why is it still over 300?

1195
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,911
It's okay if I can't be discharged.

1196
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,454
I saw it coming.

1197
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,291
How? Were you feeling unwell?

1198
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,584
Yes, I was.

1199
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,963
I felt bad for worrying you.

1200
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:47,469
I did 12 laps during the day yesterday.

1201
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,473
But at night, I only managed to do eight.

1202
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,558
Eight laps?

1203
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,144
Ma'am, I was just…

1204
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,562
Just…

1205
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,732
Just…

1206
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,360
I shouldn't have said those things.

1207
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,196
I didn't eat much
because I had no appetite.

1208
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,698
I didn't walk enough either.

1209
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,660
I may not be a doctor,

1210
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,663
but even I knew
I wouldn't be able to be discharged.

1211
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,959
You told me many times
to eat and exercise well,

1212
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,545
but I failed to do that.

1213
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:27,509
It's my fault, so don't feel bad. Okay?

1214
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:32,389
But what about the wedding?
What'll you do about it?

1215
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,767
Don't worry.

1216
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,771
I called last night to say I couldn't go.

1217
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,689
I canceled it.

1218
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,441
You canceled the wedding?

1219
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:47,654
Had I done that from the beginning,
I would've saved you the hassle.

1220
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,491
I just really

1221
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,951
wanted to go.

1222
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,834
When I used to be

1223
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,004
young and beautiful like you,

1224
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,591
I thought I always had time
to do things later

1225
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,469
and wait for another opportunity.

1226
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,557
But once you age,

1227
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,768
every opportunity becomes

1228
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:19,937
your last.

1229
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,148
There is no next time.

1230
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,609
And time isn't on your side either.

1231
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,574
So see things while you still have time

1232
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,410
and do things while you still can.

1233
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,871
Then you'll have fewer regrets
when you die.

1234
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,289
And you'll miss them less.

1235
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,754
I hope you'll live

1236
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,049
that kind of life.

1237
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,677
Don't have regrets like I do.

1238
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:55,514
Okay.

1239
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,142
Don't worry about me.

1240
01:13:58,725 --> 01:13:59,935
From now on,

1241
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:04,690
I'll walk diligently every single day
and eat a lot too.

1242
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,651
Ma'am, please only walk

1243
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,612
as much as your knees can handle.

1244
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:14,199
Just 30 minutes twice a day is enough.

1245
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,953
As for food, try to eat
a balanced diet and chew well.

1246
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,622
Overeating is forbidden.

1247
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,335
I'm sorry.

1248
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:26,295
Oh, my.

1249
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,464
Don't be so ridiculous.

1250
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:38,557
Goodness, Ok-im!
What are you doing here all alone?

1251
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,186
How could you not tell us
about the surgery?

1252
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,314
Is she okay?

1253
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,733
Yes, the surgery went well.

1254
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,359
She's doing well.

1255
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:50,527
Mom.

1256
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,238
You should've at least told us.

1257
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,449
We can reschedule the wedding.

1258
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:58,285
Grandma, do you know how shocked we were?

1259
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,121
I see. Are you her granddaughter?

1260
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,331
Yes.

1261
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,791
I'm sorry that the wedding got canceled.

1262
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:05,959
It's okay.

1263
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,712
We can set a new date
after she's discharged.

1264
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,216
You even canceled the wedding
because of your grandmother.

1265
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,344
Well…

1266
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,470
Of course.

1267
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,349
How can we have a wedding
without the bride?

1268
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,142
Sorry?

1269
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:24,853
Well…

1270
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:29,066
Look. She's not the bride.

1271
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,859
It's me.

1272
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:34,404
I'm the bride.

1273
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:39,576
Think about it.

1274
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,745
How could there be a wedding
without a bride?

1275
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:46,708
The wedding will only happen if I'm there.

1276
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,212
I canceled the restaurant
and photographer,

1277
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,589
but I couldn't cancel these rice cakes.

1278
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,216
That's great.

1279
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,345
Yeong, please share these rice cakes
with the hospital staff.

1280
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:02,307
They're all running around day and night

1281
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,560
without even having a proper meal.

1282
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,188
Give my beautiful doctor two…

1283
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,439
No, three pieces!

1284
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,524
Three?

1285
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,110
Here you go.

1286
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,653
Thank you.

1287
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,614
Thank you, ma'am.
Sure.

1288
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,706
Hey! Quick! They're changing it now!

1289
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,082
What? Changing what?

1290
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,005
Oh, my.

1291
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,352
It's not you.

1292
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,771
I knew it. None of his tips worked.

1293
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,191
"Talk warmly"?
Did you guys actually believe him?

1294
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,528
"Dear Nurse Oh Ji-young."

1295
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:59,406
"You were always the first to come running

1296
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,784
and eager to treat me
whenever I was in pain."

1297
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:06,330
"Your actions were
a greater comfort than any words."

1298
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,624
"I'd like to thank

1299
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,835
all the other medical staff as well."

1300
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:14,171
There you are.
"Other medical staff including Um Jae-il."

1301
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,012
I even washed my hair to take a photo
and upload it on social media.

1302
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:24,389
That's great.
Why?

1303
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:28,060
Today is OB-GYN's photo day.
The yearly group photo.

1304
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,519
Gosh.

1305
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,271
Gosh, I hate it.

1306
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,075
Hello.
Hello.

1307
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,409
Is everyone here?

1308
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,619
They should be coming.

1309
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,043
You, the doctor at the very end.

1310
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,837
Yi-young.

1311
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,506
He's calling you.

1312
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:01,093
Yes. Could you please come down one step?

1313
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,429
Thank you.

1314
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,434
Why are we taking this in May
instead of March?

1315
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:13,689
To give time to those
who might've given up, quit, or run away.

1316
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,067
It'd be awkward for both

1317
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,778
those who've left and those who've stayed
if they're in the photo.

1318
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,279
You can't cross out their faces.

1319
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,448
Why isn't Gynecology here?

1320
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,867
They have a conference with GS
that hasn't ended yet.

1321
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,452
They should be here in five minutes.

1322
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:30,747
Then could you take a photo
of just us first?

1323
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,833
Obstetrics will take one first.

1324
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,960
Should we do that?

1325
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:38,755
Sir, please take one photo
of just us first.

1326
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,716
Yes, ma'am. All right then.

1327
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,218
Are all our residents here?

1328
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,387
Where's Ku Do-won?

1329
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,722
I don't see the chief resident.

1330
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,974
I'm coming! We're all here.

1331
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:50,934
Excuse me.

1332
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:53,895
Is everyone here?
Yes.

1333
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,522
Okay, I'll take it now.

1334
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:58,442
Say "cheese" on the count of three.

1335
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,694
Instead of "cheese,"

1336
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:02,696
I'd like to suggest we say "wah-wah."

1337
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,573
What is he saying?

1338
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:08,160
I like it.

1339
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,288
Let's say "wah-wah."

1340
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:14,750
Make sure you say it. I'll be watching.

1341
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,668
I don't think I can.

1342
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,254
I have something else in mind.

1343
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,175
Please say "wah-wah"
on the count of three.

1344
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:27,137
One, two, three!

1345
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:30,557
Wah-wah!

1346
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:54,224
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUESTS
MOON TAE-YU AND HA YOON-KYOUNG

1347
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:57,602
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1348
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,563
Knock, knock. I heard the news.

1349
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,023
That you have the same taste as me.

1350
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,066
Is he seeing anyone at the hospital?

1351
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:04,109
Oh Yi-young.

1352
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,444
Did anyone say
that they're interested in him?

1353
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,196
Me too. I like them a lot.

1354
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,073
Are you really that happy?

1355
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:11,283
How could I not be? We're eating together.

1356
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,576
There is one person.

1357
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:13,785
Who is it?

1358
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,454
Why don't you give it a try, Yi-young?

1359
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:17,873
It's completely unfair.

1360
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,584
Why give the opportunity
to someone who wants to quit?

1361
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,502
What a waste of opportunity.

1362
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,545
I can't do it alone.

1363
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,089
Yi-young has definitely lost interest.

1364
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,466
Professor Seo won't let this one slide.

1365
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,928
Then who'll assist
Professor Seo's surgery?

1366
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,179
Should I go?

1367
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,556
We're friends, so please understand.

1368
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,183
Why make friends when I'm quitting soon?

1369
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,104
I'm sorry.

1370
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,357
Whether we can do it or not
isn't for us to decide.

1371
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,694
If it's for the mother and her baby,
we do it.

1372
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,488
I hope the baby weighs
at least 2.7 kg at birth.

1373
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:52,991
Please save my baby, Doctor.

1374
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,076
Please. Let me meet my baby.

1375
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,039
There is a cheat code I use
when I'm scared and terrified.

1376
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,342
