EPISODE 9

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,530
Hi.

4
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,950
You wore your surgical cap to work?

5
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,619
You should take your bib off.

6
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,455
Hey, this is…

7
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,875
Look at this. I knew this would happen.

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,377
"Born in 1996.
Horoscope for second week of October."

9
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,337
"A week of war
with fights breaking out often."

10
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,841
"Especially with superiors at work,
they're strewn like landmines."

11
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,676
"You can try, but you can't avoid them."

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,930
Last week, you said things would be rosy,
but it was a battlefield for me.

13
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,265
That's the problem.

14
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,476
If that was supposed to be rosy,
imagine this week.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,853
There were 690,000 babies born in 1996.

16
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,481
But it doesn't make sense
they'd all have the same fate.

17
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,565
I don't believe in that.

18
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,275
This is super accurate.

19
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,193
Look.

20
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,195
"Struggling without being fulfilled--"

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,908
Geez, I'm just trying
to tell you to be careful.

22
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,789
Excuse me.

23
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,889
Hi.

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,475
Hello.

25
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,148
You're early.

26
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,817
Yes.

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,407
Then, want some coffee?

28
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,661
Not on an empty stomach.

29
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,080
Same. And I feel just as awkward
with you guys too.

30
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,581
No, that's not what I meant.

31
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,708
My stomach really is weak.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,336
It's the truth though.

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,504
Hello, Professor Seo.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,632
Dr. Tak. I haven't seen you in a while.

35
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,676
-How are you?
-Good.

36
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,096
-Are you on Pediatrics rotation now?
-Yes.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,767
Seeing babies there every day
reminds me of my time in OB.

38
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,229
It's October now, so shouldn't you decide
on a department soon?

39
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,564
I'm still thinking things over.

40
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
I wanted to go into Surgery,

41
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,610
but after working in Internal Medicine,
that was appealing too.

42
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,989
In that case, you can choose
a department where you can do both.

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,075
Like OB-GYN.

44
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,204
Didn't Dr. Pyo tell you about that?

45
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,455
I did.

46
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,707
I did tell you, right?

47
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,959
Yes.

48
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:48,877
Good job.

49
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,839
I heard Nam-kyung was very good to you.

50
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,594
Yes, very.

51
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,431
Wherever I went,
there weren't any doctors like Dr. Pyo.

52
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,184
Right? There isn't.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,815
You should go since you're busy.

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,947
I hope to see you
in our OB-GYN residents' lounge next year.

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,659
Thank you.

56
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,625
I guess he's not coming.

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,877
That can't be. He clearly said he would.

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,755
I thought we were getting one somehow.

59
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,465
Darn it.

60
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,767
You can go up first.

62
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,743
Filming?

63
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,537
Yeah, the professor gave the okay.

64
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,291
They want to see our everyday work lives.

65
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,919
Just be yourself. Don't force anything.

66
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,838
Really? I can just be myself?

67
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,467
But maybe work a bit harder?

68
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,551
Okay.

69
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,845
I got consent
from the patients about filming

70
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,889
and notified those
who didn't want to do it,

71
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,848
so it should be fine.

72
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,766
Okay.

73
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,435
There they are.

74
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,478
Thanks for helping.

76
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,704
Hello.

77
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,456
Goodness. Hello.

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm TV producer Jang Yung-suk.

79
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,668
First-year resident Oh Yi-young.

80
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,130
Nice to meet you. Gosh, this is where
my Mo-ne and Ma-ne were born.

81
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,298
Goodness.

82
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,551
Is that so?

83
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,303
Yes.

84
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,929
Shall we go then?

85
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:05,888
Just a moment.

86
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm here today

87
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,685
with a colleague of mine
who knows hospitals well.

88
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,271
But why is he so late?

89
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,397
Sorry!

90
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,900
-Hello.
-Hello.

91
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,527
This is our camera operator.

92
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,778
-Hello.
-Hello.

93
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,906
I went to the tenth floor,
thinking it was GYN.

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,158
GYN?

95
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm sure I said come to OB-GYN.

96
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,203
Here, OB is Obstetrics. GYN is Gynecology.

97
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,539
Combined, they're called OB-GYN.

98
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,625
I didn't ask that, did I?

99
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,794
-Why were you late?
-I went to the tenth floor.

100
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,881
Why would you go there?
I clearly told you to come to OB-GYN.

101
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,215
GYN is also OB-GYN.

102
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,009
Hey, I never said go to GYN.

103
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,469
I said OB-GYN.

104
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,137
Also, I don't even know what GYN is.

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,681
Shouldn't you know
if you're shooting a show on OB-GYN?

106
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,517
You can shoot a show
without knowing what GYN is, okay?

107
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,728
After doing a few dramas,
you've become arrogant.

108
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,812
Excuse me.

109
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,898
I'm a bit busy.

110
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,609
If you're going to fight,
we can do it next time.

111
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,694
-No, we're sorry.
-No, we apologize.

112
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,029
Let's go then.

113
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,946
Okay.

114
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,993
What was the name of the show?

115
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,120
It's a new show.

116
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,499
The title is Jang Yung-suk's Wee-oww.

117
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,504
It's a reality variety show
set in a hospital.

118
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,882
But a hospital isn't
as dramatic or tense every day

119
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,094
as you might think it is.

120
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,721
It's just a place
where people work and stay.

121
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,306
Yes?

122
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,641
What?

123
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,145
Why is Dr. Myeong in an ambulance?

124
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,316
AMBULANCE ONLY

125
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,526
Please be careful.

126
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,486
Name is Song Na-mu.

127
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,988
She's 38 weeks, elderly primi,
and ROM with contractions.

128
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,367
She's not our patient,
but she's in pain and lives far away.

129
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,160
-So let's admit her.
-Okay.

130
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,053
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

131
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:09,971
That's

132
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,848
mine.

133
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,766
-I see.
-Thank you.

134
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:22,150
How could I ignore a mother
whose water just broke?

135
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,945
She was lucky though.

136
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,866
She was in shock,
so while being transported…

137
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,660
She came in with the mother
who fainted at the department store?

138
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,413
Yes. And it was in front of film crew
on their first day here.

139
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,789
Right place, right time.

140
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,791
So that's why she's being interviewed.

141
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,001
Yes.

142
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:44,213
But why was Dr. Myeong
at a department store during work hours?

143
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,925
Nurse, serology and blood typing
were sent out, right?

144
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,843
Yes.

145
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,264
I'll check Ms. Lee Mi-ju's
amniotic fluid and ultrasound.

146
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,600
Dr. Myeong said she'd do that…

147
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,726
She told me to do it.

148
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,228
I'll do just these two
and check on Ms. Song.

149
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,022
Okay.

150
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,484
I'm Professor Kong Gi-sun.

151
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,652
-You must've been pretty startled.
-Yes.

152
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,989
I had labor induction
scheduled for next week,

153
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,783
so I didn't expect my water
would break before then.

154
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,577
I see.

155
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,163
Since you said you'll give birth here,

156
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,416
I've contacted your hospital
in Haenam myself

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,418
and retrieved your medical records.

158
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:27,256
I went ahead and checked
your lab results myself today,

159
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,925
and everything looks just fine.

160
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,803
That's such a relief.
Thank you, Professor.

161
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,349
I do have many deliveries lined up, but…

162
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,976
I see.

163
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,813
Then, can the doctor who saved me

164
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,690
deliver my baby?

165
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,362
Do you mean Dr. Myeong?

166
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,571
Yes.

167
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,615
There's no need.

168
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,785
Professor Kong is much more skilled
at deliveries than I am.

169
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,746
It just feels like
the way we met was fate.

170
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,209
If you could deliver my baby as well,
I won't ever forget you.

171
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,631
I think that would be a good idea as well.

172
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,552
I'm busy anyway.

173
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,428
Take good care of her.

174
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,514
Okay, then.

175
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,393
Doctor!

176
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,353
I'll do my best.

177
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,522
Of course. I'll put my full trust in you.

178
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,565
Thank you.

179
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,611
-Don't worry.
-Thank you.

180
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,244
She came to Seoul to see a fortune teller.

181
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,163
They said a natural birth
was essential for the baby's health.

182
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,625
Prep with that in mind.

183
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
But, Doctor,
the patient is on the older side,

184
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,755
and her pelvic outlet is a bit narrow.

185
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,424
The EBW is on the heavier side too.

186
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,341
Really?

187
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,429
If it's 3.5 kg, it's still fine.

188
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,513
You scared me.

189
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,850
I promised her a VD.

190
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,937
But what if that doesn't go smoothly
and we have to operate?

191
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,439
I've seen a lot of cases like that.

192
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,940
Don't you think I know that?

193
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,567
But we have to.

194
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,737
I guaranteed her
a natural delivery on camera.

195
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,196
I'll look foolish if we operate.

196
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,239
What?

197
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,075
It even won't be a tall order.
Let's make it a natural delivery.

198
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,246
Okay.

199
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,124
I was too busy to buy you a coffee today.

200
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,042
-Hello.
-Hello.

201
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,922
It's okay. You haven't even eaten yet.
Your lunch box was still there.

203
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,050
No wonder why I felt so hungry.

204
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,220
Jae-il, the intern coming to GYN tomorrow

205
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,347
is Nam Dong-eun, right?

206
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,599
Yes, I told him to come right to the ward.

207
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,809
I heard from a friend

208
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,145
that he's had rotations
with eight departments

209
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,773
and went to work dinners
with seven of them.

210
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,567
He's like me then. Very extroverted.

211
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,027
No, that's not it.

212
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,322
In all seven
of the work dinners he went to,

213
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,408
they had beef barbecue.

214
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,496
And that means he must obviously be…

215
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,830
-perfect!
-Perfect!

216
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,875
I wish someone like that
would join our department.

217
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,210
Doctor.

218
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,961
Don't you worry.

219
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,713
I might not know everything,

220
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,216
but I know how to steal someone's heart.

221
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,469
I've stolen the hearts of every fan,
from young girls to their moms.

222
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,388
Convicted 124 times for theft,

223
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,433
I'm the bandit known as Um Jay.

224
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,729
Hey.

225
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,398
Hello, sir.

226
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,900
I clearly told you on Friday

227
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,236
to call Colorectal Surgery
for a co-op consult, didn't I?

228
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,654
Yes, sir. You did.

229
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,079
But they're all going to a conference
on Friday, so no one will be here.

230
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,247
Sir, I--

231
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,208
I'm sorry, Professor.
I'll do whatever I can to book it.

232
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,376
There's no need.

233
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,836
Why?

234
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,920
Because I booked it.

235
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,298
The professor arranged
the consult himself.

236
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,386
What kind of third-year goes around
forgetting to book consults?

237
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,888
Even first-years don't make that mistake.

238
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,183
What on earth could he
possibly learn from you? What?!

239
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,727
Wait, sir…

240
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,979
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,273
You prepare for surgery like a damn…

242
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,028
Geez. Seriously.

243
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,619
I'm sorry, Doctor.

244
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,414
You told me to do it yesterday.

245
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,500
I know.

246
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,880
I…

247
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,929
I should've checked once more.

248
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,598
Right?

249
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,807
I forgot too.

250
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,978
No, it was my mistake.

251
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,354
Because of me…

252
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,983
I'm sorry, Doctor.

253
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,945
If you know you messed up, it's okay.
Just don't make the same mistake again.

254
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,364
Yes, Doctor.

255
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,284
I won't ever make this mistake again.
I promise.

256
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,288
Doctor Ki.

257
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,582
I'm very sorry.

258
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,125
I get it. It's fine.

259
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,919
I'll go explain the surgery for Room 1004.

260
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,295
Okay.

261
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,178
I guess this is why
everyone calls her Eun-mi the Saint.

262
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,555
Imagine if it was Dr. Cha.

263
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,768
I didn't see the lab update in the notes.

264
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,977
I'll get to it, ma'am.

265
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,939
And I saw we switched
Jang Jin-gyeong's pain meds to fentanyl.

266
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,106
I saw that too!

267
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,321
If a first-year makes a mistake,
the second-year gets blamed,

268
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,489
so I was nervous about it.

269
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,823
But I didn't make a mistake…

270
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,663
Thank you for checking
despite your busy schedule.

271
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,292
Right, so to make sure
I don't have to worry,

272
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,877
let's do better, okay?

273
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,421
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,507
But, Doctor,

275
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,093
I'm organizing
this week's surgery schedule.

276
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,679
The PDS planned
for Ms. Kwon Yu-jin on Thursday

277
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,098
was canceled
and was changed to an IDS instead.

278
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,015
Why is that so?

279
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,893
We were told to do that.

280
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,811
Right.

281
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,065
But when Ms. Park Seong-ok
had surgery last week,

282
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,151
serous carcinoma was suspected on her CT,

283
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,946
and the level of METs was similar,
but we still went with PDS.

284
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,448
Right, so the professor told us to…

285
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,158
Yes, I'll be right there!

286
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,328
I'm busy right now. We'll talk later.

287
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,042
Geez, that darn "second-year"!

288
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,087
-Dr. Cha?
-Yeah, she calls every hour.

289
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,339
"Did you do it? Are you going to?"

290
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,966
She's gotten much better.

291
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,551
She used to call me every 30 minutes.

292
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,761
She never answers my questions.

293
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,264
I'm the one who can't trust her.

294
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,726
Hey, someone with separation anxiety
and trust issues is still better

295
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,271
than a slacker senior
who always steals the credit.

296
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,024
Dr. Myeong?

297
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,901
Yeah.

298
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,944
Or maybe not?

299
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,446
Is that one better?

300
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,157
No. They're all weird in OB-GYN.

301
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,700
That is true.

302
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,827
My anesthesiologist friend told me

303
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,872
watching an OB surgery
is like watching a horror film.

304
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,167
When we're delivering the baby,
everyone's shouting and yelling.

305
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,377
As soon as the baby's out,
we start humming happily.

306
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,589
By the time we're closing up,
we ask in the kindest voice,

307
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,257
"Where do you live?"

308
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
"Have you eaten yet?"

309
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,179
All of this happening within three minutes

310
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,680
makes it super creepy.

311
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,807
No one's normal.

312
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,809
No, there is one person who's normal.

313
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,728
Who?

314
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,396
Dr. Ki Eun-mi.

315
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,898
Yeah, I agree with that.

316
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,361
Did you know Dr. Ki is of mixed ancestry?

317
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,740
She was born half-human, half-angel.

318
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,784
That's why her blood type is angel type.

319
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,204
And starting from today,
she's my role model.

320
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,748
Second only in admiration
to my colleagues, BTS,

321
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,250
she's my hero, savior, and mentor.

322
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,379
There's one more normal person.

323
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,255
Dr. Ku Do-won.

324
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,050
-Right.
-What are you talking about?

325
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,970
Mr. Routine voluntarily shows up early
every day at 4:30 a.m.

326
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,262
You think that's normal?

327
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,472
He doesn't anymore.

328
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,141
He sometimes gets in at 6:00 a.m.

329
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,643
How do you know that?

330
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,602
I saw him.

331
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,813
What?

332
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,815
I mean, I didn't see him.

333
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,027
Sometimes, he wasn't in the cafeteria.

334
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,613
At 5:00 a.m.

335
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,408
Mr. Routine has changed.
He used to be my role model.

336
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,076
How many role models do you have?

337
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,496
OH JOO-YOUNG

338
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,791
-I have to go.
-Where?

339
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,002
To have dinner.

340
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,378
You were just eating!

341
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,556
Seung-won.

342
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,057
What?

343
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,440
I…

344
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,443
What is it?

345
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,365
Yi-young…

346
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,913
Don't fight with her.

347
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,961
Sweetie! Honey!

348
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,879
Sweetie!

349
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,843
-What's this? You bought groceries?
-Yeah.

350
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,011
-Like what?
-What you asked.

351
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,597
-Let me see.
-Kiwis and loach soup.

352
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,265
I don't like loach soup though.

353
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,267
I didn't buy this for you.

354
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,020
And the oranges?

355
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,773
I really don't like loach soup.

356
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,817
-Hey, be careful!
-It's hot!

357
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,653
Really, Seung-won?

358
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,989
Sorry, love is an involuntary reflex.

359
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,783
I couldn't help it.

360
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,493
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

361
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,168
I'm carrying a life. Remember?

362
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,754
Please be careful around me.

363
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,174
You just had the embryo transfer today.
It's still a cell.

364
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,426
How dare you refer to our Forever as "it"?

365
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,386
"For" what?

366
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,847
You take "young" from Joo-young
and "won" from Seung-won,

367
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,266
and you get "young-won" or forever.

368
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,936
What do you think?
Good nickname, right?

369
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,730
What a cheesy nickname.

370
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,066
Did you have trouble with anything today?

371
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,984
I was so happy I couldn't tell.

372
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,362
There were four embryos this time.

373
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,406
Two were transplanted and two were frozen,
so we could try again.

374
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,992
It's like a savings plan.
It's so reassuring.

375
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,621
I thought no more egg retrievals
meant no more shots, so I was happy.

376
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,872
But now it's a different one.

377
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,624
-Shots?
-Yeah.

378
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,335
Shots to thicken the uterine lining.

379
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,171
It helps with implantation
and chances of maintaining the pregnancy.

380
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,174
But it hurts a lot.

381
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,551
Why?

382
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
They're progesterone shots,

383
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,637
but unlike the others,

384
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,640
it's oil-based and causes hard lumps
at the injection site.

385
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,433
So they're nicknamed "rock injections."

386
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,478
You know more than our first-years do.

387
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,481
Well, I've got IVF experience
under my belt.

388
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,985
Hey, first-year,
just come to me with your questions.

389
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,115
Stop eating that and eat proper food.
You said you wanted loach soup.

390
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,034
She said avocados, kiwis,
and loach soup are good for implantation,

391
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,619
so we bought a week's worth.

392
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,289
Just having a balanced diet will do.

393
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,832
Yeah.

394
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,083
See? That's enough of this.

395
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,459
Gosh, it's too cold.

396
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,836
Have some hot loach soup.

397
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,213
You're so funny.

398
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,757
Did I tell you about our trip?

399
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,092
A trip? All of a sudden?

400
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,970
We have to wait over a week
to find out if implantation worked.

401
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,181
We thought of doing something
to pass the time faster.

402
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,640
Well, if I stay home,

403
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,227
I'd stare at the pregnancy test all day
and get stressed about it.

404
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,314
She promised me
she won't do any tests this time.

405
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,900
That's great.

406
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,818
Have fun and enjoy a change in scenery.

407
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,946
Can you hand me my phone?

408
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,245
PREGNANCY TEST KIT

409
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,426
Hello?

410
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,511
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

411
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,441
Would you like to think it over?

412
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,151
No, I'll do it.

413
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,861
Okay. Then--

414
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,821
Wait, I don't think I can do it.

415
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,491
Okay. Then we'll just forget about--

416
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,701
No, I'll do it. Please sign me up.

417
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,204
You made a good choice.

418
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,333
It's an installment savings plan
for young to middle-aged adults.

419
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,502
It's 150,000 won per month
for a year. Correct?

420
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,419
Yes.

421
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,008
We also have two-year plans.
Would you like to hear about them?

422
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,593
No, I need the money next year.

423
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,929
I might become an aunt by then.

424
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,518
I wanted to buy an infant car seat,
but it was so expensive.

425
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,728
So you're going to be an aunt.

426
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,313
Congratulations in advance.

427
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,314
Is it a boy or a girl?

428
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,317
We don't know yet. It's still just a cell.

429
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,363
But whatever it may, I'll be happy.

430
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,907
It sounds like you
and your sister are close.

431
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,576
We're really not. She hates me.

432
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,163
I hope you see
the plan through until the end.

433
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,044
Excuse me,

434
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,172
I have a question.

435
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,010
To extend my overdraft account next year…

436
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,886
We just need your proof of employment.

437
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,723
And if I don't have that?

438
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,266
That might make it hard.

439
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,435
Right.

440
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,357
What brings you to the bank?

441
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,485
Well… Nothing, really.

442
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,864
Here.

443
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,994
I already had breakfast though.

444
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,829
No, it's not for you.

445
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,500
Your sister likes the streusel bread here.

446
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,211
But I'm stuck here today.
Could you give it to her?

447
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,215
I like streusel bread too.

448
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,427
Even more than my sister.

449
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,561
I'll buy you some next time.

450
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,146
That's what you always say.

451
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,273
You said you'd buy me crabs too.

452
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,651
They're just empty promises, right?

453
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:43,987
Look at this.

454
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,363
You forgot, didn't you?

455
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,327
Dr. Oh, I…

456
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,297
Would you like to have dinner with me?

457
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,512
-Tomorrow at 9:00 p.m.?
-Okay.

458
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,972
Shouldn't you check your schedule--

459
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,974
I'm free. Absolutely…

460
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,811
I can make it.

461
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,363
Your phone.

462
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,032
What should we eat?

463
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,496
-Your phone.
-Where should we go?

464
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,214
Dr. Oh.

465
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,217
Your phone.

466
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,135
Right.

467
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,806
Yes?

468
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,641
I'll be right there.

469
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,781
I'm almost there, Sa-bi.

470
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,075
Me too.

471
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,413
What's going on?

472
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,372
Doctor.

473
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,960
The professor asked me
to remove the drainage bag.

474
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,044
Okay.

475
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,006
The Number 1 bag.

476
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,803
What did you just remove?

477
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,138
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,139
Being sorry doesn't--

479
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,724
Our intern didn't know--

480
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,475
We should've been here with him.

481
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,977
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,229
Then what do we do?

483
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,857
Won't this cause problems?

484
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,359
Yesterday, the Number 1 bag
barely had any drainage,

485
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,070
so the professor said
to remove it first this morning.

486
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,408
The Number 2 bag also has barely had
any drainage since yesterday afternoon.

487
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,203
The color and volume
in the bags look fine,

488
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,371
so removing both should be fine.

489
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,373
There's nothing to worry about now.

490
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,460
Really? It's okay?

491
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,006
Still, we'll let the professor know

492
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,717
and check when the remaining bag
can be removed

493
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,760
and we'll let you know.

494
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,679
So you're saying she's okay?

495
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,597
Yes.

496
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,225
We're sorry for alarming you.

497
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,185
I was so scared.

498
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,270
Please make sure and ask.

499
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,521
Of course.

500
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,942
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,109
Right.

502
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,737
We'll let you rest.

503
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,748
Dr. Nam.

504
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,875
Why did you call us both? We're busy.

505
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,631
I called you first, but you didn't answer.

506
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,968
So I called him,
and he said he'd come right away.

507
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,554
But then, you said you were coming too.

508
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,307
I usually don't get angry
at anyone so easily.

509
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,268
But why do you keep making
ridiculous mistakes?

510
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,979
And it's all on the chart. So why?!

511
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,148
It can happen.

512
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,442
Today's his first day at GYN,
so it's hectic for him.

513
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,860
Right?

514
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,281
I'll call the professor and find out.

515
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,825
Thank you.

516
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,994
Have you had lunch yet?

517
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,916
Get yourself some coffee and snacks.

518
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,127
And get some fresh air too.

519
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,006
Thank you.

520
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:31,965
Go on.

521
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,508
It's okay.

522
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,930
Hey, you have to tell him
exactly what he did wrong.

523
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,683
He probably knew what to do,
but was just too nervous.

524
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,813
Are you trying to lure him over to OB-GYN?

525
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,607
No. I'm trying to copy what Dr. Ki does.

526
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,900
Just copying her won't work.

527
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,862
Excuse me.

528
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,363
Yes? How can we help you?

529
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,115
Are you, by any chance…

530
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,616
Excuse me.

531
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,039
-Yes?
-You're him, aren't you?

532
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,291
-It's you, right?
-Sorry?

533
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,084
HI-BOYZ!

534
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,879
You're Um Jay, right?

535
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,047
Yes.

536
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,021
How did you recognize me?

537
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,232
I've been a huge fan of yours
since middle school.

538
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,195
I cried so much when you disbanded.

539
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,239
You debuted on February 4, 2011.

540
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,158
Your first music show win
was on June 2, 2012.

541
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,660
And you suddenly disbanded
on December 28, 2013.

542
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,790
Jay.

543
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,127
Thank you.

544
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,465
Your mother will be fine.

545
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,634
Yes, I think she will.

546
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,472
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

547
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,808
Doctor.

548
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,601
Have some tea.

549
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,269
Thank you.

550
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,946
Is something wrong with Ms. Song?

551
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,615
No, she removed the NST
to go to the bathroom.

552
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,158
I helped her put it back on.

553
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,410
When did you examine her?

554
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,412
Three hours ago, and she was at 2.5 cm.

555
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,496
And the ultrasound?

556
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,040
I checked yesterday
when she came and it was fine.

557
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,167
Then check it again now.

558
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,461
What? Why?

559
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,963
Tell Ms. Song

560
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,923
that I especially asked you to check.

561
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,758
I'm going into surgery, so text me.

562
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,469
Surgery? You don't have any today.

563
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,596
I'm assisting.

564
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,681
Go check now.

565
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,599
Okay.

566
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,979
I'm going for an ultrasound.

567
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,689
Okay.

568
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,569
Ma'am, we'll put you under now.

569
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,113
We'll put the injection in your back.

570
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,450
You may be afraid since you can't see,
but it doesn't hurt too bad.

571
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,828
I'll hold your hand.

572
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,960
Please bend forward a little more.

573
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,759
And lastly, don't forget
to remove the Foley catheter

574
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,886
-from Ms. Yoo Ji-an tomorrow morning.
-Okay.

575
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,387
If she can't self-void--

576
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,681
We'll need to reinsert the Foley,
so I'll make sure.

577
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,644
And this is really the last thing.

578
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,481
Prescriptions and consent forms
for tomorrow's surgeries--

579
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,690
Doctor?

580
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,485
Ms. Oh Seol-eun's been vomiting,
so I asked for an antiemetic.

581
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,487
Right. I'll prescribe it now.

582
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,615
And the professor said to change
Ms. Kim Yoon-jin's anti-cancer drug.

583
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,824
Right.

584
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,242
You're right.

585
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,497
Gosh, what was that anti-cancer drug?

586
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,499
-Gemcitabine and carboplatin.
-Right.

587
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,254
You got it right.

588
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,054
But, Doctor,

589
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,725
for patients on gemcitabine only,
we prescribed 1,000 per BSA.

590
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,188
Is it right to use the same dose
when it's on a regimen with carboplatin?

591
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,689
STRUCTURED TREATMENT PLAN

592
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,775
Why don't you look it up before you ask?

593
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,860
That'll help you study too.

594
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,987
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,079
We do use the same dosage.

596
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,789
See? It is the same dosage.

597
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,750
Try to remember these things.

598
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,586
Don't ask because you forget again.

599
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:40,964
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,468
Is Ms. Song all right?

601
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,971
She was in pain,
so I gave her a PCA an hour ago.

602
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,389
She's better now.

603
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,349
Ma'am!

604
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,812
I'm sorry.

605
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,355
Are they still filming?

606
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,523
I think so.

607
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,817
Damn, I'm at home.

608
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,318
Then…

609
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,654
I'll prepare Ms. Lee Yong-shim's
results for tomorrow--

610
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,864
Wait.

611
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,325
I think I need to see Ms. Song.

612
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,161
What? You said you're at home.

613
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,997
I am, but…

614
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,958
I should go and see.

615
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,668
Wait.

616
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,169
Let's do this.

617
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,551
What?

618
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:32,307
MYEONG EUN-WON

619
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,349
Hi, Dr. Oh.

620
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,066
Ms. Song, I'm away right now
due to a paper I'm writing.

621
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,526
But I was just worried.

622
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,361
Despite the hassle, I hope you understand.

623
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,405
You didn't have to call like this.

624
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,991
I'm just so grateful. Thank you, Doctor.

625
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,202
You're looking well.
Everything will be fine.

626
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:58,166
I was in and out of pain all day.
It's a bit scary.

627
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,210
I'm getting reports in real-time.

628
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,963
If anything happens,
I'll be there even if it's late at night,

629
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,006
so don't worry.

630
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,841
Thank you.

631
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,551
Dr. Oh.

632
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,510
Yes?

633
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,721
I can't see your face.

634
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,726
-I'm here.
-Right.

635
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,355
Monitor contractions and the baby
and text me every hour.

636
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,314
Every hour?

637
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,274
Yeah. Keep up the good work.

638
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,489
My goodness. She's such an amazing doctor.

639
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,657
I know, right?

640
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,494
I'll be back in an hour then.

641
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,037
Okay.

642
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,501
Hello, Doctor.

643
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,380
The intern's supposed to observe surgery,
but he's not here or picking up either.

644
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,924
Let me try calling him.

645
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,842
Okay, bye.

646
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,572
Hello, this is intern Nam Dong-eun.

647
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,449
Sorry?

648
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,994
I am observing the surgery.

649
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,788
Really? Where are you right now?

650
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,541
I'm at OR 2.

651
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,337
Hello?

652
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,221
Dr. Nam.

653
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,849
OR 2 was for Urology.

654
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,267
OB-GYN is OR 10.

655
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,898
I mean, you're supposed
to observe a hysterectomy,

656
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,735
so why observe a prostatectomy?

657
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,403
There's no uterus there.

658
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,196
Gosh, I'm sorry.

659
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,281
Hey, Dr. Nam.

660
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,288
It can happen.

661
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,459
ORs are chaotic and nerve-wracking.

662
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,545
You can get the people and rooms mixed up.

663
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,090
I'll be more careful from now on.

664
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,303
I told Dr. Ku

665
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,680
you received a call
for an EKG in the ward.

666
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,308
So tell him that if he asks.

667
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,311
Okay. Thank you.

668
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,276
But have you always been bad with numbers?

669
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,155
I was good at math,

670
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,616
so I'm not sure why I'm like this.

671
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,664
She forgets to do her own work,
but gets on my case to do better.

672
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,750
It's better than badgering
while slacking off.

673
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,376
If I ask, she says, "Ask later."

674
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,170
If I do, she says, "Why don't you know?"

675
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,214
It's better than "Do it again"
without checking!

676
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,507
Again, again!

677
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,716
Hey, be quiet!

678
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,134
-I'm upset!
-I'm upset!

679
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,388
Since when did you two get along so well?

680
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,849
Yeah, stop bad-mouthing them.

681
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,602
And it's not hard only for you.
It's hard for our seniors too.

682
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,981
After mentoring the intern,
I realized how hard it was.

683
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,693
It must have been a pain
for them to mold us into decent doctors.

684
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,989
That's still an ongoing process, okay?

685
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,580
For crying out loud.
Can we get some work done?

686
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,540
Sorry.

687
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,127
Use scratch paper for scribbling.

688
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,963
Hey, this isn't scribbling.

689
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,840
Someone asked for my autograph.

690
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,882
Yeah, right.

691
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,761
Hey. Sa-bi, you saw it.

692
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,179
You were there.

693
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,722
Hey, tell her!

694
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,933
Room 1020's guardian is a Hello Girl.

695
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,977
A Hello Girl? What's that?

696
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,353
That's the name of his fan club.

697
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,189
From our hit songs
to the variety shows we were on,

698
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,358
she knows all of our history.

699
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,111
She cried more when we broke up
than for her mother's surgery.

700
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,030
I don't care if it's HI-BOYZ or BYE-BOYZ,

701
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,993
but if you're not going to quit,
you should start doing some work.

702
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,247
TO PARK YU-HYEON
HELLO GIRL! FOREVER! THANK YOU

703
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,791
I will after my meet-and-greet.

704
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,128
Want to come too?

705
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,131
No, right?

706
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,632
See you tomorrow.

707
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,805
Hello?

708
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,308
Yes, I'm on call tonight.

709
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,352
I'll go check now!

710
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,647
I heard she was bleeding and checked.

711
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,400
It's continued,
and pulse is up from two hours ago,

712
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,401
so I called you.

713
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,114
Yes, we'll keep an eye on this for now.

714
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,658
What? But she's bleeding a lot.

715
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,953
Ma'am.

716
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,541
Sometimes, there can be some bleeding
from the surgical site.

717
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,376
Really?

718
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,838
I don't have to do
the surgery again, right?

719
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,842
Maybe if there's more bleeding,
but it's still okay right now.

720
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,721
Let's keep an eye on it until the morning.

721
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,181
Okay.

722
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,399
Doctor, it's not active bleeding, right?

723
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,318
Does she need embolization?

724
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,906
The pad count's low,
and the bleeding's just mild and oozing.

725
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,449
We can monitor her for now.

726
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,453
We need to check her hemoglobin,
so do a lab test for that.

727
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,371
Okay.

728
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:45,012
ACTIVE BLEEDING
ONGOING FROM THE STUMP AT 6 O'CLOCK

729
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,653
Hello, this is Kim Sa-bi.

730
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,447
Doctor, it's about Ms. Yoo San-ho,
who you checked at 2:00 a.m.

731
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,116
Yes. What is it?

732
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,537
Judging from the continued bleeding,
I think it's active bleeding.

733
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,122
I said it wasn't.

734
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,916
The bleeding's minimal but persistent.

735
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,127
And her hemoglobin's dropped to the tens.

736
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,964
I followed up and BP's 100 over 70,
pulse is 105, pad count is 200.

737
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,216
I checked everything too.

738
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,010
She's fine.

739
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,111
6:00 A.M. PAD COUNT

740
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,947
Hello, this is Kim Sa-bi.

741
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,700
Professor.

742
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,204
It's about Ms. Yoo San-ho
who had a hysterectomy today.

743
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,664
She's had vaginal bleeding since midnight.

744
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,168
It appears to be active bleeding.

745
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,381
Hey, Kim Sa-bi!

746
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:48,135
Repeat what you said to me
when you called at 2:58 a.m.

747
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,722
Ms. Yoo San-ho.
BP is 100 over 70. Pulse is 105.

748
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,599
Pad count is 200.

749
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,310
And hemoglobin is in the tens.

750
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,438
-Cha Da-hye.
-Yes, sir?

751
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,273
What should we do in this case?

752
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,652
Closely monitor her until morning.

753
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,237
If there are no abnormalities,

754
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,656
we should notify you
during morning rounds.

755
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,660
Right?

756
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,288
-Cha Da-hye.
-Yes, sir?

757
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,251
Why be on call
if you're not going to help? Why?

758
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,255
A first-year calling a professor
directly is ridiculous.

759
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,674
Then why have seniority
or senior doctors at all?

760
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,677
I'm sorry, sir.

761
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,305
Between the first-year
who calls about such things

762
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,933
and the second-year
who doesn't check them,

763
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,103
you two are a complete mess.

764
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,608
You two

765
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,320
better not continue
to work so cluelessly like this.

766
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,248
I'm sorry, Dr. Cha.

767
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,293
The thing is, I thought…

768
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,801
Hey, Sa-bi. Want to eat?

769
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,488
It's today, isn't it? Right?

770
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,451
If something happens by chance--

771
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,870
Don't say that. That's inviting bad luck.

772
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,131
See you later.

773
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,974
Doctor, I think it's started.

774
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,017
Right.

775
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,481
We'll have her begin pushing.

776
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,486
Ma'am, we're going to start pushing now.

777
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,029
Watch me and follow along.

778
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,072
Okay.

779
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,449
Where's Dr. Myeong?

780
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,534
She's with an outpatient.

781
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,993
You can push with me,

782
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,496
and when we're ready for delivery,
she'll come.

783
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,455
Okay.

784
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,873
-Let's get in position.
-Okay.

785
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,795
Pull below your thighs and hold them.

786
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,088
One, two, three.

787
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,589
Push.

788
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,218
More, more! As long as you can!

789
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,346
Take a breath, and again.

790
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,014
Push harder. We have a ways to go.

791
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,061
Okay, one, two, three. Push!

792
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,314
Push!

793
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,775
A bit more!

794
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,443
Ma'am, you have to keep it together.

795
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,112
If you don't push, the baby won't come.

796
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,656
The baby's done all it can.
You just need to push.

797
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,743
Doctor, there's too little progress.

798
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,412
It's been almost two hours.

799
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,663
Damn it, what could be wrong?

800
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,668
MYEONG EUN-WON

801
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,553
DOCTOR, WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR TWO HOURS.
THERE'S NO CHANGE. SHOULD WE PREP THE OR?

802
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,929
Why isn't she replying after reading?

803
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,434
Ma'am, are you really tired?

804
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,023
-Let's try another ultrasound.
-Okay.

805
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,288
I made eye contact with the baby.

806
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,748
You can see its eyes.

807
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,380
It's easier to deliver
when the baby's face-down,

808
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,257
but it's face-up,
so you're finding it hard.

809
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,678
Then what do we do?

810
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,722
Well…

811
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,768
You're going to have to
push more and much harder.

812
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,810
Let's try it.

813
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,562
Okay, push harder. Again.

814
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,315
One, two, three, and inhale!

815
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,318
Push!

816
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,113
Harder! Longer!

817
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,073
More!

818
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,078
Just a second.

819
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,374
Yes, Doctor?

820
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,501
Doctor, it's about Ms. Yong Jin-suk.

821
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,670
Did you check
the chest X-ray interpretation?

822
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,632
I did put in a request earlier,

823
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,801
but I haven't checked yet.

824
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,594
I'm sorry.

825
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,263
Then what about
the OTPT follow-up results?

826
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,474
Just a moment.

827
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,017
Let me check.

828
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,986
When I saw it earlier,

829
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,656
I don't think the results were in.

830
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,866
What about the hemoglobin level?

831
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,120
I'm not sure about that either…

832
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,163
I see.

833
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,874
I'll go to the ward later
and check myself.

834
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,251
It's okay.

835
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,128
Thank you, Doctor.

836
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,505
I'm sorry.

837
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,260
-Shouldn't you go?
-No.

838
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,845
It's okay.

839
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,265
You didn't know anything.
Won't you get in trouble?

840
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,686
Nope. He's a first-year resident.

841
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,895
He's super nice.

842
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,356
He never gets mad or annoyed.

843
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,774
He doesn't even scold me.

844
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,485
You're so lucky.

845
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,446
Should I choose OB-GYN?

846
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,491
If I don't do my work, he does it for me.

847
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,911
He covers up my mistakes
and does anything I ask for.

848
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,081
He's a bit of a… How do I put it?

849
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,500
He's kind of a pushover.

850
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,751
Damn.

851
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,423
I can just wing it, and he does the rest.

852
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,848
Your name was Nam Dong-eun?

853
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,436
Enjoy your food.

854
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,344
Dr. Nam.

855
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,929
Ms. Baek Geum-yeong's ABGA.

856
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,932
I was going to do it now. I swear.

857
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,099
I did it.

858
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,893
You seemed busy earlier.

859
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,023
Thank you.

860
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,404
And…

861
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,116
I'm sorry.

862
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,621
It's fine.

863
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,041
When you're an intern,
ABGA is the hardest to do.

864
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,919
And your hands shake
if they start to hurt.

865
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,756
No, it's not that. Earlier--

866
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,174
By October of your first year,

867
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,634
you just toss the syringe,

868
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,637
and it lands perfectly in their wrist.

869
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:30,847
Doctor.

870
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,765
That was a joke.

871
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,105
You can go home now.
I don't have any more tasks for you.

872
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,195
It's all right.

873
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,406
You can go.

874
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,245
Okay.

875
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,086
Good night, sir.

876
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,095
I'm sorry.

877
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:12,889
See you tomorrow.

878
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,901
Jae-il, Ms. Yoon Su-mi's
blood test results…

879
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:30,991
Doctor.

880
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,761
You don't even smoke. Why come here?

881
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,140
They say if you smoke
when you're frustrated, you feel better.

882
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,435
I wanted to imagine what it was like.

883
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,857
What do you want me to do?

884
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,317
What?

885
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,070
That bastard.
You want me to go yell at him?

886
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,739
Or drag him here to make him apologize?

887
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,492
You're not going to do that.

888
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,622
I mean…

889
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,417
I just don't think
it's my place to interfere.

890
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,296
Right.

891
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,132
It's my problem to solve.

892
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,679
Um Jae-il.

893
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,974
Getting mad
and scolding someone isn't easy.

894
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,603
The one scolding feels uncomfortable,
self-conscious, and unpleasant.

895
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,647
But you still have to do it.

896
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,983
We do it for a reason.
If you make a mistake, you'll be scolded.

897
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,068
And for interns,

898
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,154
they need someone who scolds them
to teach them what's right

899
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,656
rather than a nice person.

900
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,492
I don't think so.

901
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,579
Instead of being scary and scolding,
when they said, "It's okay,"

902
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,164
"You can do better next time,"

903
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,709
"It was our mistake, not yours,"

904
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,546
it made me want to do better
and never make a mistake again.

905
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,630
Who did that?

906
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,631
Dr. Ki Eun-mi.

907
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,426
Hey, that's…

908
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,013
That's because you're nice.

909
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,393
Since you're nice,
you accept her kindness with thanks.

910
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,436
That's who you are.

911
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,729
That's why that worked on you.

912
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,232
There aren't many people like that
in the world or even here.

913
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,317
Most would take advantage of
and belittle you.

914
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,656
Life's easy when you're mean.
Who'd live foolishly like you guys?

915
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,493
What do I do now then?

916
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,248
I can't tell you to be mean though.

917
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,710
Gosh, I don't know.

918
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,758
Scold mistakes and praise success.
Start with that.

919
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,886
Then don't you think
you'll develop a sense

920
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,222
of when to get mad and when to comfort?

921
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,475
Right.

922
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,812
If you're just clear about that,
the juniors seemed to appreciate it.

923
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:07,856
Okay.

924
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,735
But, Doctor…

925
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,947
have I ever told you I loved you?

926
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,157
And very much at that.

927
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,701
Bye.

928
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:25,999
Wait for me!

929
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,589
Ma'am, you have to breathe
to get oxygen to the baby.

930
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,634
Inhale deeply and exhale.

931
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,135
Very good.

932
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,137
Breathe in and exhale.

933
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,139
Doctor, did you get my text?

934
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,849
I don't think a VD will work.

935
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,309
Try for another 30 minutes.

936
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,520
No, we can't. We really can't now.

937
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,605
I told you the baby's OP.

938
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,148
The baby's not coming at all.

939
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,942
Did you do things properly?

940
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,693
Yes, we've worked really hard.

941
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,487
And she's still pushing now.

942
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,781
It's been almost three hours
and it's still in station.

943
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,865
The fetus is OP too.

944
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,451
The mother's too exhausted to go on.

945
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,619
So?

946
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,914
She's been pushing for almost three hours,
and you want surgery now?

947
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,707
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

948
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,292
Should I book an OR?

949
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,338
Doctor?

950
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,049
Hey, are you telling me
to do a full C-section?

951
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,801
Don't you know that's the worst?

952
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,927
I know.

953
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,097
But I think we need to.

954
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,767
I said I promised her a VD.
How many times have I told you?

955
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,229
No! We have to do surgery!

956
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,190
Hey, are you out of your mind?
How dare you use informal--

957
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,655
Hold your breath a bit more.
Just once more!

958
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,323
Are you okay, Ms. Song?

959
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,491
Let me take a look.

960
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,661
Doctor, it hurts so much!

961
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,165
She can't push and has been in labor
for almost three hours.

962
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,250
They said an OR is open.

963
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,257
She's having a really hard time,
and if the baby…

964
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,467
If deceleration worsens…

965
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,226
Dr. Oh!

966
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,565
Why haven't you booked an OR yet?

967
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,234
Were you waiting
until the fetal monitor signs dropped?

968
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,069
Is your judgement that poor?

969
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,738
I've been saying--

970
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,324
What are you doing?
Get her to the OR! Now!

971
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,100
I LIKE YOU A LOT TOO

972
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,983
-Hello?
-Hello, I'm the flower courier.

973
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,361
Instead of the lobby,
please come to the parking lot.

974
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,196
Come all the way in, please.

975
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,364
Well, the thing is…

976
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
I'm sorry.

977
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,617
What?

978
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,453
Were you the one who called?

979
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,247
-Are you Ku Do-won?
-Yes.

980
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:12,916
I'm sorry.

981
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,502
I ran into a bus out front.

982
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,503
So they're…

983
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:18,880
No, it's okay.

984
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,508
Are you all right?
Were you hurt anywhere else?

985
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,593
No, I'm fine.

986
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,928
But the flowers are…

987
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,346
I'm sorry.

988
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,515
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

989
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:29,975
I'm sorry.

990
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,687
-Mr. Park Jeong-woong?
-Yes?

991
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,356
-Do you feel any pain anywhere else?
-No.

992
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,399
Hello?

993
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,401
This is Bon Moment.

994
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,318
Yes?

995
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,278
I'd like to confirm your reservation.

996
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,030
For two at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow…

997
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,198
No, it's today.

998
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,826
Sorry? You reserved it for tomorrow.

999
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,036
I reserved for the 13th.

1000
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,456
Yes, that's tomorrow. Today's the 12th.

1001
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,042
Damn it.

1002
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,380
I'm sorry.

1003
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,590
I'm sorry, but are there any tables today?

1004
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,635
We're fully booked today.

1005
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,100
I'm sorry, I can't do tomorrow,
so I'll have to cancel.

1006
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,228
Pull. More!

1007
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,649
Remove the instrument.

1008
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,487
Fundal.

1009
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,828
The baby's out.

1010
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,664
It's 7:35 p.m., and it's a boy.

1011
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,792
He's healthy and so beautiful.

1012
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,377
You can see him soon.

1013
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,171
Thank you.

1014
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,469
We'll remove the placenta
and start suturing now.

1015
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,846
You may feel some discomfort.

1016
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,318
CENTRAL OPERATING UNIT

1017
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,028
Nice work, Dr. Oh.

1018
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:06,946
You did great,

1019
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:11,326
but you'll need to study more
on dystocia criteria and section timing.

1020
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,537
It's okay.
You can ask me questions anytime.

1021
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,130
Mr. Jang, we got it.

1022
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,841
Thrills, touching moments,
and quotable lines. It has it all.

1023
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,968
I think this will be a hit.

1024
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,936
SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE
OB-GYN

1025
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,449
Who is it?

1026
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,035
It's Kim Sa-bi.

1027
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,088
I'm sorry.

1028
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,718
I was wrong. I made a mistake.

1029
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,263
It's fine.

1030
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,723
I already got yelled at anyways.

1031
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,267
What else can I do?

1032
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,607
If you're not going to listen to me
and do your own thing,

1033
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,401
why bother updating me?

1034
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,154
Why? Just do things on your own now.

1035
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,405
You're smart.

1036
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:32,907
I'm sorry.

1037
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,661
It's all my fault,
so I don't know what to say.

1038
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,625
So instead of just verbally apologizing,

1039
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,713
I thought about
what I should do going forward.

1040
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,928
From now on, I won't mess around
and solely trust my own judgement.

1041
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,852
So to do that, until all my suspicions
and curiosities go away,

1042
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,022
I'm going to ask you everything.

1043
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,443
Until I'm absolutely sure
and have no more questions left--

1044
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,444
Don't.

1045
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,737
What?

1046
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,905
I said don't.

1047
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,990
Don't ask me questions!

1048
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,534
I don't know either! Okay?

1049
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,954
We're all in the same boat!
We're both idiots!

1050
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,625
How can a second-year admit
to a first-year that they don't know?

1051
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,751
That's embarrassing!

1052
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,505
Damn it, this is so embarrassing.

1053
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,971
But not knowing
is nothing to be ashamed of.

1054
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:38,973
What?

1055
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,808
I'm sorry.

1056
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,020
Damn it, Sa-bi.

1057
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,897
But, Dr. Cha…

1058
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,524
Well,

1059
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,152
there's nothing
I'm curious about in that book.

1060
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,030
I know everything in it.

1061
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,160
Well, good for you.

1062
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,703
How very nice!

1063
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,914
I'm sorry.

1064
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,500
Don't smile.

1065
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,294
I'm still angry!

1066
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,006
Don't smirk!

1067
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,050
I said I'm still mad!

1068
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:25,853
Ta-da.

1069
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,482
I really needed this right now.
How'd you know?

1070
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,609
Because we're a team.

1071
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,702
I told Nam Dong-eun
to finish the dressings before leaving.

1072
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:43,246
He tried his best.
But he can't help being slow.

1073
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,540
After I finish this, I'll do it.

1074
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,458
Damn it.

1075
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,628
Hey, you were the same.
You don't remember, do you?

1076
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,047
Doctor, how can you smile right now?

1077
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,258
Then should I cry
that he didn't do the dressings?

1078
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,517
I'll start with Room 1011.

1079
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,643
Forget it. Go home.

1080
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,353
You go home instead.

1081
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,688
I can do it.

1082
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,773
No, I can do it. I'm doing it.

1083
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,393
Why is there so much to write?

1084
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,898
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

1085
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,193
I, Oh Yi-young,

1086
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:41,114
can no longer stand
Dr. Myeong Eun-won's tyranny.

1087
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,908
It's become too hard
to hold back my pent-up anger,

1088
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,285
which is why I am resigning.

1089
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,708
PRINT

1090
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,006
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

1091
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,597
Hey!

1092
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,645
Here.

1093
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,565
I don't give these to anyone.

1094
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,649
It's nonalcoholic.

1095
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,746
Dr. Myeong?

1096
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,457
Why does she only pick on me?

1097
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,461
You were in her doghouse in March.
Did something happen after that?

1098
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,005
I stood up to her once.

1099
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,673
Or did I confront her?

1100
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,636
In any case, we just don't get along.

1101
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,055
She's… weird.

1102
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,307
She has no damn shame.

1103
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,518
I thought I was watching a one-woman show.

1104
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,562
When I was texting
and calling her for surgery,

1105
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,897
she went on and on about a VD.

1106
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,898
Then all of a sudden,

1107
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,025
"What are you doing? Get an OR!"

1108
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,280
She glared at me all through the surgery.

1109
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,323
But with the camera on,

1110
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,451
"Ask me anything if you have questions."

1111
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,622
Like that. Gosh, she thinks
she's some master surgeon.

1112
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,082
I was sure this was nonalcoholic.

1113
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,001
I can't do it anymore.

1114
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,085
I won't take it.

1115
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,672
You're really quitting?

1116
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,049
Yeah.

1117
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,259
I'm leaving before I cause trouble again.

1118
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,177
Trouble?

1119
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,764
Hey, those rumors were true?

1120
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,098
At the local hospital?

1121
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,815
You sure are incredible.

1122
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:43,903
But isn't it such a waste?

1123
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,406
You've made it to October
enduring this mean and nasty first year.

1124
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,866
I won't come back anyways.

1125
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,368
I don't need this.

1126
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,327
Really?

1127
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,330
Then I guess you don't need that either.

1128
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,545
The end-of-year bonus.
We get it in December.

1129
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,464
You just need to wait two months.

1130
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,758
That's too bad.

1131
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:09,887
How much is it?

1132
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:11,722
Quite a bit.

1133
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,771
Why do they give bonuses in December?

1134
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,357
That's so annoying!

1135
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,444
KU DO-WON

1136
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,951
Yes, Doctor?

1137
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,287
I'm sorry.

1138
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,540
But could we reschedule our plans?

1139
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,958
Why?

1140
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,212
I'm sorry. Something came up.

1141
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,842
Fine.

1142
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,052
Okay, bye.

1143
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,805
What was that?

1144
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,849
How come nothing ever goes my way?

1145
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,101
I told you.

1146
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,228
"A week of war."

1147
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,190
I told you it's really accurate.

1148
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,413
In any case, don't read me
my fortune anymore.

1149
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,917
Me too. It's better not to know.
There's no solution anyway.

1150
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,253
Hey, we can't go on like this.
Let's go change our luck.

1151
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,047
I checked our horoscopes today.

1152
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,299
-Don't.
-What is it? What did it say?

1153
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,427
Sa-bi's lucky number is 12.

1154
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,721
Yi-young's lucky drink is beer.

1155
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,056
Nam-kyung's lucky place?

1156
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,057
Karaoke.

1157
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,476
-What? You saw it too?
-Yeah.

1158
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,894
Okay, but listen.

1159
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,896
Today's the 12th.

1160
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,607
And none of us are on call.

1161
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,983
So we can drink beer.

1162
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,944
And where do we go after drinking?

1163
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:49,612
Karaoke!

1164
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,365
It sounds like you made up
those connections just to hang out.

1165
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,532
No.

1166
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,910
Our horoscopes are telling us to have fun!

1167
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,120
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

1168
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,081
Let's have fun for just one night!

1169
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,375
She won't go though.

1170
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:05,670
Let's go.

1171
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,422
What? What's gotten into you?

1172
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,632
Today, I…

1173
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,053
Whatever. Let's drink.

1174
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,805
You're serious, right? Then…

1175
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,100
We need raw eggs for karaoke.

1176
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,310
You carry raw eggs around?

1177
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,062
You never know when you'll go.

1178
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,313
Got anything else?

1179
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,982
Like anti-hangover drinks?

1180
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,527
Ta-da!

1181
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,737
Here, take one each.

1182
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,407
You're the best, Jae-il.

1183
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,242
What else is in there?

1184
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,119
I knew this day would come.

1185
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,621
Okay. Bottoms up, everyone.

1186
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,248
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

1187
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,505
Hey, let's go. We can't waste a minute.

1188
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:55,344
We should have been friends

1189
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,264
And let everything go

1190
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,725
Seeing you with someone else…

1191
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,602
Hey, you're really not singing?
There are only three minutes left.

1192
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,479
No, I'm not in the mood.

1193
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,816
You're not singing either?

1194
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:11,986
You're going to sing?

1195
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,447
I need to go to the restroom.

1196
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,449
Then I'll do a song. Okay?

1197
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,826
At least listen to the last song first.

1198
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,079
To see you a bit longer

1199
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,291
If I see you again--

1200
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,084
Hey!

1201
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,086
I was just at the climax of the song!

1202
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,796
Goodness, I'm sorry.

1203
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,048
You did that on purpose.

1204
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,799
Since you came to karaoke with me,

1205
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,718
you have to hear this before going.

1206
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:43,559
I pray it's not the end

1207
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:46,687
I want to hold onto this night

1208
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,107
I can't let you go like this

1209
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,445
Nothing can come between us

1210
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,076
I'm blinded by love…

1211
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,702
He came here to do this.

1212
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,454
Is this the song?

1213
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,498
Yeah, HI-BOYZ.

1214
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,333
And made you cry a lot

1215
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,544
I can't help but love you

1216
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,632
We were both so young

1217
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:18,844
The foolish memories of my first love

1218
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:22,139
I hope this song

1219
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:26,477
Can send us back to those days

1220
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,440
When that day comes, I'll tell you then

1221
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,609
You were my whole life

1222
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,486
Jae-il!

1223
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,363
This is amazing.

1224
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,073
When that day comes

1225
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:43,160
I'll come running to you

1226
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,079
He's looks so different.

1227
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,292
If that fateful day ever comes

1228
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,293
Why is he so good?

1229
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:59,593
I hope we can go back to those days

1230
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,514
When that day comes, I'll tell you then

1231
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:07,476
You were my whole life

1232
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,186
The end of longing

1233
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,188
When that day comes

1234
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,859
I'll come running to you

1235
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:22,783
If that fateful day ever comes

1236
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,248
I hope we can meet again

1237
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,750
I'll keep wishing on and on

1238
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,342
Holy cow, Sa-bi!

1239
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,056
Did you save that?

1240
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,561
-The K-pop idol!
-Sa-bi, is this right?

1241
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:51,687
Is it?

1242
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,231
Kim Sa-bi!

1243
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,566
Don't. I said don't!

1244
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,027
So you've always liked them?

1245
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:58,944
I don't know.

1246
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,406
-Sa-bi. I'm pretty good, right?
-It's here.

1247
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:03,908
My taxi's here.

1248
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,910
Bye. I want to see an encore next time.

1249
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,119
Bye!

1250
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,495
Once is enough for me.

1251
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,413
See you tomorrow.

1252
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,549
Why is it taking so long?

1253
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,136
What about you?

1254
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,096
I didn't call one yet.

1255
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,140
I wanted to see you all off first.

1256
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,523
Hey.

1257
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,234
Want me to do it for you?

1258
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,443
What?

1259
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,781
Damn it.

1260
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,326
Hey, what's with you?
Why didn't you tell me?

1261
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,245
How did you

1262
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,789
hold in all that excitement during work?

1263
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,503
I'm saying this
to set the record straight.

1264
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,505
I am a fan.

1265
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,091
But not of yours.

1266
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,592
What?

1267
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,679
I liked Top Key, not you.

1268
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,347
Liar.

1269
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,642
And your first music show win
was June 9th, not June 2nd.

1270
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,060
You were a nominee on June 2nd.

1271
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,563
That Hello Girl guardian
had the dates wrong.

1272
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,440
Just so you properly know.

1273
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:21,485
Okay, then.

1274
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,407
Bye.

1275
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,242
Bye!

1276
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,080
Weren't you supposed to be busy?

1277
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:16,874
Yes, well…

1278
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,420
You didn't lie to avoid
having dinner with me, did you?

1279
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,589
Why would I lie like that?

1280
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,758
Then why did you cancel on the day of?

1281
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,055
I'm sorry.

1282
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:41,690
I was so excited
to have dinner with the person I like.

1283
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:51,950
I'm heading in first.

1284
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,419
To be honest,
tonight's reservation was canceled.

1285
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,213
I bought flowers too, but…

1286
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,550
They got ruined.

1287
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,596
I even wrote you a card.

1288
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,564
I left it there.
I really did write one though.

1289
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:28,737
So I only have this left.

1290
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:34,618
I…

1291
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:39,832
Oh Yi-young…

1292
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,296
I like you…

1293
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,676
You like me?

1294
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:52,803
Really?

1295
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,765
Are you confessing your feelings to me?

1296
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:58,684
Yes.

1297
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:12,781
I…

1298
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,495
I've said how I felt a lot,
so I don't have to tell you, right?

1299
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,257
Then…

1300
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:33,760
Then…

1301
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:41,727
We're…

1302
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,966
Let's not tell Joo-young for now.

1303
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,010
I want her IVF to go well first.

1304
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:58,971
Then I'll tell her.

1305
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:02,724
You can do whatever you want,
and I'll go along with it.

1306
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:31,920
That's right.

1307
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,550
Right, they went on a trip.

1308
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,845
They'll be gone for a few days.

1309
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,638
I think they said for four days.

1310
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:49,146
I have to go to the hospital.
Did I not tell you?

1311
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,814
No.

1312
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,859
So, I have work…

1313
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,903
I mean, I have papers to read.

1314
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,865
-What?
-What?

1315
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,659
I forgot.
I'll sleep at the hospital tonight.

1316
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,581
Are you uncomfortable
with just the two of us here?

1317
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,252
It's been just the two of us
this whole time though.

1318
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,051
I guess being in the house is a bit much.

1319
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,603
Here's okay though?

1320
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:51,958
Get in.

1321
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,543
I'll go with you to the first floor.

1322
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,157
I heard the trailer for Wee-oww was out.

1323
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,704
What if all my fans rush here
after seeing this?

1324
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,372
Don't worry. There's only eight.

1325
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:31,957
Nine including you?

1326
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:32,999
Not me!

1327
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:37,129
But who will be the main character?

1328
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:39,756
Is it Yi-young?

1329
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,468
Yi-young, you delivered the baby
where the camera was.

1330
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,137
And you wanted to do the surgery.

1331
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,805
Forget it. It's embarrassing.

1332
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,475
Here it is.
"Trailer for Wee-oww Episode 1."

1333
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,813
A new era of human reality TV in 2023.

1334
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,440
Jang Yung-suk's Wee-oww.

1335
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,943
The place where you can never
let your guard down.

1336
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,070
Push harder! One last time!

1337
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,698
Were you waiting
until the fetal monitor signs dropped?

1338
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:06,324
Is your judgement that poor?

1339
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,536
A split second
can determine life or death.

1340
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:12,122
And those moments add up
to create a miracle!

1341
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,833
And it's where you meet beautiful people.

1342
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,126
Don't worry.

1343
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:17,878
You can ask me questions anytime.

1344
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,841
How could I ignore a mother
whose water just broke?

1345
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,761
She was lucky though.

1346
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:29,306
See for yourself
on Jang Yung-suk's Wee-oww.

1347
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,606
Myeong Eun-won again? Again?

1348
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,357
Why does everything good happen to her?

1349
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,525
Why?

1350
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,987
Hey, it's not her fault.

1351
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,572
Damn you, Jang.

1352
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,533
I'm never watching his shows again.

1353
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,665
Hey, did you see Yi-young's face?

1354
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:57,918
When was it?

1355
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,377
-At 17 seconds.
-It was?

1356
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:03,799
Going home?

1357
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:07,302
Did you see it?

1358
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,261
No.

1359
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,806
No what?

1360
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:11,723
What?

1361
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,433
What didn't you see?

1362
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,568
PLEASE DON'T PUSH THE DOOR

1363
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:29,825
Hey!

1364
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:30,784
Excuse me.

1365
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,118
Please be careful.

1366
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:35,914
Please go on.

1367
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:24,087
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUESTS,
NAH YUNG-SUK & SHIN WON-HO,

1368
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,797
THE ETERNAL COMEDY DUO

1369
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,175
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1370
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,469
-Don't they seem weird these days?
-In what way?

1371
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:32,512
It's a bloody rivalry.

1372
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:35,140
Did you tell Prof. Kong
the surgeries have been delayed?

1373
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,017
If we have two, I should get one.

1374
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,351
Why does she get both?

1375
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,561
I need that one.

1376
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,354
That's what I was going to say.

1377
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,647
I need it.

1378
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,316
Is she playing mind games with me?

1379
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,318
-It's Prof. Seo's patient.
-Hold on.

1380
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,611
Professor Kong said…

1381
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:50,280
You should come during lunch
when we're on break.

1382
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:52,073
I told you several times I just heard too.

1383
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:53,825
I'll be quick!

1384
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:54,743
Did you two fight?

1385
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:56,620
-No!
-You did.

1386
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,580
Why would I? I have no reason to.

1387
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:00,373
Are you in a contest to see who's worse?

1388
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:02,375
What?

1389
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,419
What are you going to do?
Get married? You?

1390
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,503
Who is it?

1391
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,588
Is it someone from work?

1392
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,132
Do you want to keep this a secret
or tell everyone?

1393
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:10,634
The first-years don't know anything.

1394
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,761
I wonder if I should tell them first.

1395
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,387
-Who was that?
-Are you…

1396
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,223
What are you doing?

1397
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,769
Are you here to save lives
or to take them?

1398
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:21,728
I'm sorry.

1399
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:24,147
If you want to be alone,
come here during the day.

1400
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:25,482
And go there at night.

1401
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,525
I haven't been here in so long. Gosh.

1402
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,028
We were both so young

1403
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:34,199
The foolish memories of my first love

1404
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:37,494
I hope this song

1405
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:41,998
Can send us back to those days

1406
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:47,087
When that day comes, I'll tell you then

1407
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:50,590
You were my whole life

1408
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,009
The end of longing

1409
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,594
When that day comes

1410
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:58,682
I'll come running to you

1411
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:06,147
If that fateful day ever comes

1412
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:13,029
I hope we can meet again

1413
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,323
I'll keep wishing on and on

1414
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,411
