00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,313
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,418
Doctor, in third grade,

4
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,212
I was diving at a swimming pool.

5
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,967
My face hit the pool floor,
and I broke my front teeth.

6
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,137
-Okay.
-So,

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,098
these are crowns.

8
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,560
They could break during intubation,

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,020
so I'm just reminding you.

10
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,271
Yes, I'll be careful.

11
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,522
Thank you.

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,108
Are you going to start now?

13
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,610
Yes, I'm ready.

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,528
I'm not.

15
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,905
Let me know when you're ready.

16
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,490
The anesthesia's ready.

17
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,492
Yes, we're wrapping up.

18
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,286
I…

19
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,081
want to go back.

20
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,877
Hey, if the pathology results are out,

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,338
you need to put them together
and send them to me.

22
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,589
I'm sorry, sir.

23
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,008
What about the cervical cancer data?

24
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,968
I was going to email it to you today.

25
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,847
Okay. That includes
the added patient data, right?

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,098
Well…

27
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,935
What, it doesn't?

28
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,813
Damn it, seriously?

29
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,066
Look, just

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,485
put it together and send it by tomorrow.

31
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,738
By tomorrow?

32
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,865
Yeah, you need to send it
tomorrow at the latest,

33
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,159
so I can add it to the paper.

34
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,328
Hey, what's wrong?

35
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,830
Hey, over here! Come here now!

36
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,414
Hey, Sa-bi!

37
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,917
What's the matter? Hey, Sa-bi!

38
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,422
This…

39
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,429
I think you'll need surgery.

40
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,722
-Surgery?
-Laparoscopic?

41
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,932
Is it bad?

42
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,975
How big is the fibroid?

43
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,184
It's not malignant, right?

44
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,352
It looks pretty big.

45
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:25,937
Professor.

46
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,191
Hey. Excuse me.

47
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,609
-Hello.
-Hello.

48
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,694
Don't you all have work?

49
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,571
Sir, we have the lab results.

50
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,615
Hemoglobin is 6.2,
so I prescribed two units of RBC.

51
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,200
My goodness.

52
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,911
You must have been really dizzy.

53
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,624
I called Anesthesiology.
OR 3's last slot tomorrow was canceled.

54
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,542
What should we do?

55
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,460
What should we do?

56
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,214
Well? Ms. Resident?

57
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,429
I think we should.

58
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,513
It's too big.

59
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,932
Let's do the surgery.

60
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,813
If we can see the myoma
from an abdominal ultrasound,

61
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,273
then it must be huge, right?

62
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,190
Didn't it hurt?

63
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,233
Of course, it did.

64
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,485
She was struggling for months
due to period cramps.

65
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,113
I told you to have it checked immediately.

66
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,574
She took a ton of meds for dizziness.

67
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,243
It's anemia caused by bleeding.
Why take headache meds?

68
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,202
I know, right?

69
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,121
She pores over everyone else's charts.

70
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,873
But she doesn't take care of herself.

71
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,250
Hey, is it going to be
scolding or worrying?

72
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,168
Just do one.

73
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,837
She's already upset as it is
since she can't work.

74
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,884
-Hello.
-Hello.

75
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,677
You don't need any explanation, right?

76
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,763
Did you fast?

77
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,473
Yes. Not even a sip of water.

78
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,849
She's not on any meds.

79
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,392
And she signed the consent form.

80
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,727
I'm her guardian.

81
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,647
She's not telling her mom.
She said it would be more of a hassle.

82
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,358
All right, then.

83
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,943
Doctor.

84
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,570
Could we stay with her
just until she's under--

85
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,655
No.

86
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,323
You'll make a ruckus in there.

87
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,575
Please, Doctor.
She says she's really scared.

88
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,535
She's been there
and seen this surgery a ton.

89
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,954
What's there to be scared of?

90
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,164
That's enough. I'll take care of it.

91
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,457
Let go. Go on.

92
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,417
-Just once--
-Just go, will you?

93
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,008
Let's go already!

94
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,343
For goodness' sake.

95
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,638
Come back healthy and sound!

96
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,974
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
EXIT

97
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,815
Here. You know how to put it on, right?

98
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,651
Nam-kyung.

99
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,528
I'm assisting. I forgot.

100
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,115
Why you?

101
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,533
Me? I'm on call.

102
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,575
Where's Dr. Ki?

103
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,618
She's in OB surgery.

104
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,619
Dr. Ku?

105
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,620
The delivery room.

106
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,248
Hey.

107
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,416
I'd rather it be Yi-young.

108
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,167
She at least sutures well.

109
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,379
Hey! Yi-young!

110
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,715
Yi-young!

111
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:04,887
What is it?

112
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,515
Nothing.

113
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,891
I must be hearing things.

114
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,603
Sa-bi will be okay, right?

115
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,855
Of course she will be.

116
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,064
It's not a major surgery.

117
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,233
The medication's going in.

118
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,965
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

119
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,097
What is it now?

120
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,974
What are you unhappy about this time?

121
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,852
It's nothing.

122
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,982
I mean…

123
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,651
Couldn't the first-years come early?

124
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,278
They can go on rounds in advance

125
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,698
and brief the seniors
before the professors arrive.

126
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,699
That'd be so nice.

127
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,660
They don't know how to do that.

128
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,162
We're lucky they show up at all.

129
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,956
I guess so.

130
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,797
But doesn't it feel like
something's missing today?

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,381
-Right? You felt it too?
-Yes.

132
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,218
I checked everything for the handover.

133
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,304
Maybe it's because
Dr. Kim's been hospitalized.

134
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,972
No, I don't think that's it.

135
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,808
What time is it?

136
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,312
He's not here.

137
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,441
He's really not.

138
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,568
Who?

139
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,653
Dr. Ku.

140
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,073
You're right!

141
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,076
I mean, rain or shine…

142
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,953
He's always here at this time.

143
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,080
What happened?

144
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,541
Is he sick?

145
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,589
Can we play some music?

146
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,800
Sure. I connected the Bluetooth for you.

147
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,552
Nice.

148
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,059
But is something wrong?

149
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,021
I mean, you always left
at 4:00 a.m. on the dot.

150
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,274
Why are you going into work with me today?

151
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,986
I slept in.

152
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,573
Is that even possible with you?

153
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,702
You had a lot of stuff anyway,
so it worked out well.

154
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,622
They don't let us go home

155
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,666
or give us time to do laundry.

156
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,420
I get why we're called residents.

157
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,548
Because we live at the hospital.
Why do we even have our own homes?

158
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,509
You don't.

159
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,471
I had one too, okay?

160
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,306
A 640-square-foot apartment
on jeonse lease.

161
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,018
By the way, I was really curious.

162
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,228
What happened to your deposit?

163
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,397
It was used for a good cause.

164
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,485
But why did you quit the local hospital?

165
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,279
Well, you know.
It was for a variety of reasons.

166
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,280
Then…

167
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,908
Your overdraft account…

168
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,702
I made big progress this month.

169
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,455
It's now negative 29,708,000 won.

170
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,706
That's impressive!

171
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,459
But why are you suddenly curious?

172
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,461
What?

173
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,713
We've lived together for a year now,

174
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,256
and you've never asked.

175
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,885
I haven't?

176
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,263
Do you…

177
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,308
What?

178
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,105
Do you think I'll ask for money?

179
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,943
As if I had any money to lend.

180
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,323
Can you pull over at the next street?

181
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,824
-I have to buy something.
-Okay.

182
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,629
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

183
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,971
HAM DONG-HO
REJECT ACCEPT

184
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,934
HAM DONG-HO

185
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,570
I stopped by on the way.

186
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,530
Your usual with extra sauce.

187
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,366
Thanks. I've been craving this.

188
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,993
I'll eat it later.

189
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,828
Hey, Sa-bi.

190
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,497
I heard you had bad nausea
early this morning from the epidural.

191
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,415
Are you okay?

192
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,041
Yeah.

193
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,376
-By the way, Nam-kyung.
-Yeah?

194
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,877
When you did the dressing,

195
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,006
I noticed it came a bit undone here.

196
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,633
No, it's not.

197
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,760
You're just mistaken
since you're still dizzy.

198
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,058
I'll put on some Steri-Strips later.

199
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,061
You did the sutures half-heartedly,
didn't you?

200
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,188
Who do you think I am?

201
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,148
Hey, Sa-bi!

202
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,608
Are you okay?

203
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,277
Gosh, you were snoring
so loudly this morning.

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,486
It wasn't me!

205
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,031
Jae-il, did you prescribe the NSAIDs?

206
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,032
Oh, right.

207
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,868
I'm in real pain.

208
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,370
The PCA's out now, so it's really painful!

209
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,039
Goodness, don't be such a baby.

210
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,624
I'll do it for you later.

211
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,791
Forget it. I'll do it.

212
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,877
No, I'll call Nurse Ju-yeon now.

213
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:31,881
Is that a new phone?

214
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,798
Yeah.

215
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,761
A clean break from the past.
A new phone for new beginnings.

216
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,220
Hey, the NSAIDs first--

217
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,347
It must be real this time.

218
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,681
I guess they really broke up.

219
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
Yeah, it's totally over.

220
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,977
I erased all our chats,
his number, and photos.

221
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
What was his number again?

222
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,564
I really

223
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,358
don't even remember.

224
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,193
Instead of you saying it was over…

225
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,986
I think he said it was over.

226
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,615
Don't you usually call that
"being dumped?"

227
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,658
My prescription first--

228
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,950
Are we in high school?

229
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,827
Dumped? I wasn't dumped.

230
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,705
Don't pretend to know
when you've never dated before.

231
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,457
Forget it. Just get out.

232
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,833
Go.

233
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,251
I have to go anyway.

234
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,337
But before I do, try this.

235
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,589
My lungs are normal.

236
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,091
At my age, this isn't necessary.

237
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,676
Still, do it. So we can see you're fine.

238
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,844
Yeah, go on.

239
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,851
Your lungs are fine. And your bowels?

240
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,022
-Are you gassy?
-No.

241
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,524
So go.

242
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
Please go.

243
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,957
There it is.

244
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,208
We can tick that off.

245
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,418
Well, they're working well.

246
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,461
Bye!

247
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,046
It wasn't me.

248
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,132
I said it wasn't me!

249
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,342
It wasn't me!

250
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,388
Hey, I'm choosing lunch.

251
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,389
See you later.

252
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,727
Yes, Professor?

253
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,230
Now?

254
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,482
Okay, I'll attach the balloons.

255
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,567
Okay, bye.

256
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,945
Hey, Prof. Seo said to buy a cake.

257
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,238
We're having a 100-day party.

258
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,782
A 100-day party for what?

259
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,286
So annoying.

260
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,955
Why aren't you here? I'm done setting up.

261
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,957
Where did you set up?

262
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,958
Where are you?

263
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,211
I've been waiting at NICU.

264
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,671
You said there's a 100-day party.

265
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,381
Geez, it's not there.

266
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,800
Then where?

267
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,859
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

268
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,454
It's already been 100 days
since you were admitted.

269
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,664
You've done so well in carrying the baby.

270
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,835
But this is something
to be congratulated for, right?

271
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,295
Of course.

272
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,881
You're supposed to be celebrated
during the entire pregnancy.

273
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,927
And you're unable to do that
with your family since you're stuck here.

274
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,803
So we should help you celebrate.

275
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,222
Is that so?

276
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
Well,

277
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,019
for 100 days, the mothers here
with high-risk pregnancies have had

278
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,564
a lot of good and bad things
happen to them.

279
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,692
I made it through
without any major incidents.

280
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,945
Gosh, so I guess it is
a reason to celebrate.

281
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,572
Thank you.

282
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,534
Did you make a wish?

283
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,451
Yes.

284
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,038
Even if it meant I had to stay here
a thousand more days,

285
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,208
I wished for my baby to be born healthy.

286
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,337
I'm sure it's been hard staying here.

287
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,214
And it's been very uncomfortable.

288
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,465
Two years ago,

289
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,301
I stayed here for 80 days
when I had my twins.

290
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,513
So, I'm pretty used to things.

291
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,015
But gosh, not seeing my twins,

292
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,769
San and Deul, is kind of hard.

293
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,855
Let's get through just two more weeks,

294
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
have our 113-day party and…

295
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,819
No, let's have a party
for the birth and go home.

296
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,154
Okay.

297
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,200
Shall we share the cake
with the other mothers here?

298
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,662
Let's just have it between us.

299
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,580
Between us?

300
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,498
They just got here

301
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,834
and haven't opened up yet.

302
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,429
Hi, San and Deul!

303
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,972
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

304
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,098
Did you sleep well?

305
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,266
Did you eat?

306
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,226
-We had snacks!
-What?

307
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,604
You can't eat snacks for breakfast!

308
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,815
Where are you, Mommy?

309
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,774
It's the doctors.

310
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,610
-Hi, Doctors.
-Hi, Doctors.

311
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,989
It's here!

312
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,158
-It's here!
-Delicious tteokbokki is here!

313
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,826
I can't wait!

314
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,244
Why did it take so long?

315
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,621
I was starving to death.

316
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,207
This is going to be so good.

317
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,960
Did you get two?

318
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,379
Now, this is it.

319
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,632
Gosh, I just had cake,
but this smells incredible.

320
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,301
Doesn't eating cake
make you crave tteokbokki even more?

321
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,636
Like a sweet and salty loop.

322
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,888
But I feel bad for Sa-bi.

323
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,723
This is her favorite.

324
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,142
-Who cares? We can eat it again.
-That's right.

325
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,479
Yo, Um Jay!
You didn't forget any toppings, did you?

326
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,438
Of course not!

327
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,857
-Just like Sa-bi told me, extra cheese!
-Yeah!

328
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,484
-Extra sausages!
-Yeah!

329
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,235
-And--
-And with glass noodles!

330
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,966
You said we'd eat this together
when I was discharged.

331
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,347
No.

332
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,683
Put the fish cake on the rice ball.

333
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
Yeah.

334
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,147
Wrap the rice cake in cheese

335
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,315
and eat with the sausage.

336
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,239
It's so good!

337
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,283
Can you roam around like this?

338
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,744
I'm bored to death, so what else can I do?

339
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,829
Bored?

340
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,039
Damn it, I'm so jealous.

341
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,582
I slept so much I can't sleep more.

342
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,460
Hey, it's barely been a day
since your surgery.

343
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,422
Hey, Yi-young.
I heard Ms. Ji's been here 100 days now.

344
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,423
How did you know?

345
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,341
I was bored,
so I looked at patients' charts.

346
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,802
She's at 32 weeks and a day today.

347
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,555
Counting backwards,
it's exactly 100 days since she came.

348
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,181
That's why we had a party earlier.

349
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,226
Has her cervix been all right?

350
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,729
Yeah. It's been fine with meds.

351
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,730
And the EBW?

352
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,523
It's fine at this stage.

353
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,526
It was at 1,900 grams
on the ultrasonography yesterday.

354
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,320
-Good amniotic fluid levels?
-Yeah. I just checked and…

355
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,199
Why don't you just do it then?
I'll stay in bed.

356
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,701
Yeah, just do that.

357
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,119
I wish I could.

358
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,497
Hey! You have to dip
the rice ball in the sauce!

359
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,001
If you're going to be
mad like that, just eat.

360
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,586
You'll get a bad attitude.

361
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,671
Then can I have just one?

362
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,548
No, you eat this.

363
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,810
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

364
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,771
You've been like this the whole time?

365
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,567
You've been lying
on your left side for days,

366
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,277
so of course your arm is numb.

367
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,571
I told her to lie on her back.

368
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,115
But she didn't want to.

369
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,117
I heard if some pregnant women

370
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,327
lie flat on their back,

371
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,704
they can faint from low blood pressure.

372
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,957
I asked if that was true
and she said she didn't know.

373
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,089
In late pregnancy,

374
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,342
the uterus expands and becomes heavy,

375
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,844
and lying on your back
may put pressure on blood vessels,

376
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,429
which could lead to fainting.

377
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,932
Then it helps to lie on your side.

378
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,562
That's why people say that.

379
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,440
Right, Dr. Oh?

380
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,526
Yes.

381
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,821
But you don't have to
worry about that yet.

382
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,030
Really?

383
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,533
Can I really lie on my back?

384
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,534
Yes.

385
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,037
If needed,
I'll tell you to lie on your side.

386
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,624
Goodness.

387
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,252
You must have read the same blog.

388
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,587
Twins, right?

389
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,590
By the looks of it, at 24 weeks?

390
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,050
Yes.

391
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,595
Twins, 24 weeks, left side, fainting.

392
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,223
If you search online,
the top result that shows is…

393
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,349
Was it Tiger Mom?

394
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,308
Or Meow Mom?

395
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,852
That's right. It's Tiger Mom!

396
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,478
I read that too two years ago,

397
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,730
so I only laid on my left side.

398
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,440
I thought my arm was going to fall off.

399
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,903
The professor told me the same thing,

400
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,072
so I laid on my back after that,

401
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,490
and everything was fine.

402
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,992
I wondered

403
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,994
where I'd heard this before.

404
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,538
Those twins

405
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,748
grew well into week 35

406
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,959
and were born healthy at 2.9 kg.

407
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,419
Really?

408
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,803
Gosh, my arm.

409
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,224
I'm a bit sad.

410
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,895
I think you trust Yeon-du more than us.

411
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,313
No, I don't.

412
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,814
It's not that.

413
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,151
I mean, she's been here a long time,

414
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,444
so I trust her.

415
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,280
If there's anything you don't know,
feel free to ask.

416
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,991
I'm a high-risk pregnancy expert.

417
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,246
"I'll find out."

418
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,749
Not even "I'll ask the professor,"

419
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,833
but "I don't know"?

420
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,252
You think a resident should say that?

421
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,962
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,548
Yi-young. You're not afraid
of me anymore, are you?

423
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,217
Right?

424
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,260
No, I am afraid.

425
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,887
I'm afraid of you,

426
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,514
but I was more afraid of my own ignorance.

427
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,185
So that's what you were afraid of?

428
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,562
Then let me fix that for you.

429
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,814
Sorry?

430
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,233
Starting today,

431
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,109
study a chapter of Williams a day,

432
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,111
summarize it, and send it to me.

433
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,113
I'll quiz you daily based on that.

434
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,700
After doing that,
all your fears will disappear.

435
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,286
-Professor--
-What?

436
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,205
It's starting from today.

437
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,290
You only have a few hours left.

438
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,092
Doctor?

439
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,060
Doctor.

440
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,646
On the ultrasound this morning,

441
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,858
I was wondering
if the cervical length looked okay.

442
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,528
Right, I meant to tell you.

443
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,577
I'm sorry, ma'am.

444
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,580
It's maintaining well
at the same length it was three days ago.

445
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,667
Okay.

446
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,003
Umbilical blood flow looks good too.

447
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,754
But, Doctor,

448
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,465
you're a bit close…

449
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,303
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,014
This is what the professor
seemed to do, so…

451
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,351
Gosh, you don't have to bend down so far.

452
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,148
Right.

453
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,486
Even sitting is hard for us,
so we're lying down most of the time.

454
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,947
So she was trying to meet us at eye level.

455
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,574
Right.

456
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,744
Your ultrasound looked good. Don't worry.

457
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,496
Thank you.

458
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,755
I get that you're tired,

459
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,841
but not replying to my text
from earlier today's a bit rude.

460
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,385
Right. I'm sorry.

461
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,470
I was so busy today.

462
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,680
I asked if you were free tonight.

463
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,474
I'm on call tonight.

464
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,102
We haven't found time
for three weeks, you know.

465
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,937
-Has it been that long?
-Yes.

466
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,440
Then how about this Friday?

467
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,983
Friday…

468
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm not on call, and I'm free.

469
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,988
Really? You're free on Friday?

470
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,700
Yes.

471
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,952
Okay, in three days then. On Friday.

472
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,579
Okay, sure.

473
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,831
What would you like to eat?
What do you like?

474
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,917
I like everything.

475
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,752
Me too.

476
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,128
Somewhere nearby is best, right?

477
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,590
-Hello.
-Hello.

478
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,467
Hello.

479
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,053
What brings you here, Dr. Ham?

480
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,763
I got a call for an epidural.

481
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,062
Aren't you getting in?

482
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,107
We still had things to talk about.

483
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,942
Please go up first.

484
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,362
I'll be up soon.

485
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,364
Okay.

486
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,451
I'll reserve a nice place nearby.

487
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,328
Yi-young.

488
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,089
Never mind. See you later.

489
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,507
Have a nice day.

490
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,484
HAM DONG-HO

491
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,654
YOU DO HAVE A DAY WHEN YOU'RE FREE, RIGHT?

492
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,322
Or maybe not?

493
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,992
DON'T FORGET FRIDAY!
YOU'RE OKAY WITH ANYTHING?

494
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,785
I'LL MESSAGE YOU
ONCE I HAVE THE PLACE

495
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,633
Hey, I was curious about something.

496
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,760
I have this friend.

497
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,722
Your friend?

498
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,017
Sorry.

499
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,935
Yeah. She's an office worker.

500
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,061
Let's say that's true.

501
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,646
What is it? Is she sick?

502
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,606
No.

503
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,400
Someone keeps asking her
to have dinner together.

504
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,944
It was a big surgery… I mean…

505
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,405
They worked on a big project together.

506
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,157
And I guess she helped him out a lot.

507
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,909
-He must be thankful.
-He likes her.

508
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,120
But there's someone else she likes.

509
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,748
So should she have dinner with him or not?

510
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,541
-Sure.
-No.

511
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,336
Asking to have dinner

512
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,712
means it's a date.

513
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,839
No, it's not.

514
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,216
He's just saying,

515
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,343
"Let's have a meal
since we worked hard together."

516
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,511
Colleagues can share a meal, you know.

517
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,805
So should I?

518
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,058
I mean, should I tell her to go?

519
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,352
Yeah. If you make a big deal out of it

520
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,771
and say, "I can't. I like someone else,"

521
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,147
you'll be so embarrassed later.

522
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,941
So just go and have dinner.

523
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,568
And in case it turns out they do like her,

524
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,196
she can tell them then
that she likes someone else.

525
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,657
Really?

526
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,034
You guys watch way too much TV.

527
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,996
Having someone like us,
having a crush on someone,

528
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,957
or confessing your feelings

529
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,333
aren't that easy to do.

530
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,584
It's actually very hard.

531
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,547
What's suddenly gotten into you?

532
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,133
Do you have a blind date
at 6:00 a.m. or something?

533
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,220
No, but someone's buying me a meal.

534
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,721
Who?

535
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,891
My first love.

536
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,478
Today? Out of the blue?

537
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,437
Where?

538
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,898
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

539
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,066
My tutor from high school.

540
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,818
I was totally in love with her.

541
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,279
I went to med school because of her.

542
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,196
She's a doctor?

543
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,073
At our hospital?

544
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,074
No.

545
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,160
It would've been so nice if she was.

546
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,037
I even confessed my feelings then.

547
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,748
But she said I'd find
tons of people like her at college,

548
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,417
so I should study hard instead.

549
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,584
But there weren't any.

550
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,920
What kind of person is she?

551
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,466
She's amazing.

552
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,803
The way she talks
and her facial expressions

553
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,471
can seem very cold and curt, but…

554
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,849
She's so lovely when she smiles.

555
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,976
And her favorite things

556
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,312
are studying and spicy tteokbokki.

557
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,148
Isn't that adorable?

558
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,611
I know someone like that.

559
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,696
Me too.

560
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,908
-That's Kim Sa-bi.
-Yeah!

561
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,328
-Hey!
-Hey!

562
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,954
You guys are so slow!

563
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,248
When are you going to do
the handovers and pre-rounds?

564
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,043
Hey, how dare you?

565
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,461
She's worlds apart from her.

566
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,174
Don't be ridiculous.

567
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,511
What's with him? Where's he going?

568
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,847
To meet his first love.

569
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,433
Hello?

570
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,185
The hospital?

571
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,854
You're doing what?

572
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,314
Wait, hold on.

573
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,940
Okay.

574
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,234
-What is it?
-Hong Gi-dong?

575
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,698
Ms…

576
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,534
Hey!

577
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,677
What brings you here?

578
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,013
Did you come here on purpose
to have a meal with me?

579
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,640
No.

580
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,519
I came to see a professor
for my PhD dissertation progress report.

581
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,855
I came a bit early.

582
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,191
And I remembered
you always asked to meet up.

583
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,485
So you did think of me.

584
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,571
Yeah. We always talked about
meeting up but didn't.

585
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,448
Right.

586
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,491
How have you been?

587
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,451
How's your residency going?

588
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,744
It's hard, right?

589
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,746
Yes, it's so hard.

590
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,290
How did you do this
for four years, Gyeo-ul?

591
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,584
Ms. Jang.

592
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,338
Not Gyeo-ul. It's Ms. Jang.

593
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,426
Okay. Ms. Jang.

594
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,055
It seemed like yesterday
you were whining about falling grades.

595
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,766
But it is cool seeing you in a lab coat.

596
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,978
It's all thanks to you.

597
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,438
After HI-BOYZ disbanded,

598
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,815
I studied with you for two years
and got into med school.

599
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,735
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have become a doctor.

600
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,070
Me too.

601
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,323
If it weren't for the pay
from tutoring you,

602
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,908
I wouldn't have graduated.

603
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,039
But…

604
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,835
do you remember that you were

605
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,545
my first love?

606
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,713
I was?

607
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,381
No, I don't remember.

608
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,300
That was so long ago.

609
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,634
More than ten years.

610
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,139
Why aren't you eating?
You always asked me to treat you.

611
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,978
This isn't what I wanted.

612
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
Take me out to another meal next time.

613
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,858
Not in these scrubs,

614
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,193
but in our personal clothes.

615
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,367
Well,

616
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,287
just go get changed and you can eat then.

617
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,789
You're playing dumb, aren't you?

618
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,291
-Right?
-Yeah.

619
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,709
Was it obvious?

620
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,253
I usually have a good poker face.

621
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,383
PEDIATRICS
AHN JEONG-WON

622
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,762
Just a second.

623
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,723
Hi.

624
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,683
Not yet.

625
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,061
I'm meeting with someone.

626
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,814
My surgery's at 4:00 p.m. today,
so it's fine.

627
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,733
I'll be there as soon as I can.

628
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,652
Okay, bye.

629
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,155
Do you have to go?

630
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,240
No.

631
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,825
Did something happen at the hospital?

632
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,701
It wasn't the hospital.
It was my boyfriend.

633
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,038
We're having lunch later,
so he asked when I was coming.

634
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:32,956
Wait…

635
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,166
Who's your boyfriend?

636
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,001
You don't know him.

637
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,127
Since when?

638
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,838
It's been a while.

639
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,632
Why are you telling me this now?

640
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,260
Why do I need to tell you?

641
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,344
Geez…

642
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,263
Then why…

643
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,641
Why are you taking me out for a meal?

644
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,728
Bread.

645
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,356
I bought you some bread.

646
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,607
Damn it.

647
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,404
Goodness.

648
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,322
When will you grow up?

649
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,589
How did meeting your first love go?

650
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,173
Fine.

651
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,967
I saw her off.

652
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,885
Why did she come?

653
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,469
For her PhD…

654
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,599
Hey. Go rest, will you?

655
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,516
Doesn't it hurt?

656
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,935
It does. It still hurts.

657
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,609
Then why are you
going around looking for work?

658
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,069
I can't stay in bed anymore.

659
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,072
Okay, work then.

660
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,616
You can work,

661
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,952
but please don't tell the patients
that surgery hurts.

662
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,120
They'll get scared.

663
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,039
But it's the truth.

664
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,707
I can't lie.

665
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,708
Geez.

666
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,628
I now know
we've been explaining things wrong.

667
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,339
Who said laparoscopic surgery
doesn't hurt? It hurts like hell.

668
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,007
And it's not simple at all.

669
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,092
There's surgery, anesthesia,
and hospitalization.

670
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,552
And you.

671
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,471
Stop nagging us for urine samples.

672
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,139
We don't like using Nelaton catheters.

673
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,726
I guess you only know
if you go through it.

674
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,186
Do you get it now?

675
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,228
What?

676
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,396
You mean the patients?

677
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,314
No.

678
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,399
How itchy unwashed hair is.

679
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,027
I've never seen you with unwashed hair.

680
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,699
That familiar smell.
Is it the smell of humanity?

681
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,700
It's not me!

682
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,327
Of course it is.

683
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,250
Hey, that's my room. No one's in there.

684
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,585
YOON
ATTENDING DOCTOR: KI EUN-MI

685
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,921
KIM
ATTENDING DOCTOR: UM JAE-IL

686
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,173
As I told you during outpatient care,

687
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,258
the cyst found on the ovary

688
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:53,304
appears benign
based on its size and shape.

689
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,973
And on the ultrasound,

690
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,183
it looks like a simple cyst,

691
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,686
so there's no need for any major concern.

692
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,397
But even so,

693
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,149
the ovaries have to be removed?

694
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,277
Yes, since you've already
gone through menopause,

695
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,405
the ovaries and fallopian tubes

696
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,532
no longer function at all.

697
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,784
So, it'll be better to remove them now

698
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,248
to lower the risk of any future diseases.

699
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,291
I see.

700
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,460
It's actually quicker and simpler to do

701
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,046
than to remove just the cyst alone.

702
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,673
You don't have to worry.

703
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,509
Well, this is such a nice hospital

704
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,387
with such wonderful doctors,

705
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,805
so I'm sure it'll go well.

706
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,225
Oh, my.

707
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,770
You're the mother of our resident?

708
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,025
Hey, what happened?
Why didn't you tell us?

709
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,110
Well…

710
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,903
I just found out too.

711
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,988
I'm sorry, Professor.

712
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,031
No need to be sorry.

713
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,825
Don't be. Ma'am, you should've told us.

714
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,535
You didn't say
at outpatient care either.

715
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,997
I didn't want to worry her
when she's busy.

716
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,249
I didn't want to be a bother,

717
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,168
and I wasn't going to come,

718
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,838
but still, it's nice to get surgery
at your daughter's hospital.

719
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,049
And you get a discount too!

720
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,760
-Welcome, ma'am.
-Thank you.

721
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,094
We're very glad you're here.

722
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,012
-Thank you.
-We are.

723
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,930
You did very well.

724
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,891
Please take care of my Nam-kyung.

725
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,975
Don't.

726
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,604
At home, her dad spoils her so much
like a princess.

727
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,400
So I don't know if she can
take care of herself in the real world.

728
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,948
Anyways, please be gentle with her.

729
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,451
Princess, we'll take good care of you.

730
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,624
What? Come on.

731
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,044
Princess Pyo.

732
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,091
Is everything okay?

733
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,761
Yes, there's no bleeding,

734
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,847
and the baby's fine. Don't worry.

735
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,849
What a relief.

736
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,935
By the way, Doctor,

737
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,729
I haven't slept at all these days.

738
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,440
I wake up every hour.

739
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,900
Is there any way to fix that?

740
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,904
We're limited on what medications
we can use during pregnancy.

741
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,697
We can't give you sleeping pills.

742
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,533
I know that too.

743
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,619
But being unable to sleep
can't be good for the baby.

744
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,413
Is there another way besides drugs?

745
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,793
Instead of lying in bed during the day,

746
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,461
if you move around a bit--

747
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,964
What if that induces uterine contractions?

748
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,425
Moving around won't induce contractions.

749
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,095
Are you sure this time?

750
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,097
Yes, I am.

751
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,893
I don't know how to help you sleep…

752
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,896
I mean,

753
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,357
let me ask the professor.

754
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,443
With placenta previa and bleeding,

755
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,529
it's no surprise you can't sleep.

756
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,616
It's because your head
is filled with a lot

757
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,910
of thoughts, worries, and concerns.

758
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,291
There's a sleeping pill I use
for when that happens.

759
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,709
She can't.

760
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,627
Taking unprescribed meds
would be dangerous.

761
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,093
When you have a lot on your mind,
you need to be active.

762
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,928
But we're scared of that too.

763
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,599
So we try to keep
at least our fingers busy.

764
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,476
I've already made 500 cranes.

765
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,151
Does folding cranes
really make you fall asleep?

766
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,611
Of course.

767
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,112
I'm living proof.

768
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,573
The clinical trial's over.

769
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,700
Thank you.

770
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,869
But if you still can't sleep, tell me.

771
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,704
I have another way too.

772
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,093
Excuse me, ma'am!

773
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,595
I mean, Ms. Ji.

774
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,514
I need a solution
before the professor comes,

775
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,767
but I have no one to ask and no time.

776
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,976
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

777
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,189
It's about Ms. Lee.

778
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,691
She has bad constipation,

779
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,777
but doesn't want to take laxatives.

780
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,238
Right, constipation.

781
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,073
For that,

782
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,207
I did my research on this place,
so it's trustworthy.

783
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,960
They deliver orders
to the hospital lobby too.

784
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,878
Tell her to try this first.

785
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,089
Thank you.

786
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,345
But I'm wondering…

787
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,100
if it's okay for me to drink as well?

788
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,687
Trust me.

789
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,022
I do.

790
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,697
Everyone, I just learned
something amazing.

791
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,074
This will work right away.

792
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,118
I need it too, so how about a group order?

793
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,036
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

794
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,830
You came for outpatient care in secret,

795
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,999
and you didn't tell me
you booked your surgery.

796
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,293
I didn't want you to worry.

797
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,211
Then you should've kept it
completely secret.

798
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,797
I work here. How could I not find out?

799
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,967
Okay, I said I was sorry.

800
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,180
Mom, your surgery's tomorrow,
so you have to fast starting at midnight.

801
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,142
Yeah, they already
explained everything earlier.

802
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,977
If you eat anything,
they'll cancel surgery.

803
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,147
That'll inconvenience all the doctors,
nurses, and anesthesiologists.

804
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,481
I said I got it.

805
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,441
Mom.

806
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,069
Don't bother the nurses either, okay?

807
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,488
And don't say anything to the professors.

808
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,824
What on earth would I ever say?

809
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,368
Mom, don't even ask questions.
Just ask me.

810
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,663
And, Mom, please don't talk about me here!

811
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,415
It's my place of work!

812
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,416
All right, already.

813
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,710
How many times
do you have to say the same…

814
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,839
Hey, did you eat yet? What did you eat?

815
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,341
Just some bread.

816
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,425
Why only bread?

817
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,843
I don't have time.

818
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,428
You should have a proper meal.

819
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,765
They say young people these days have
weak immune systems since they don't eat.

820
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,141
I saw it on Dongchimi.

821
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,476
Okay.

822
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,020
Hey, take some dumplings
while you're here.

823
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,356
I brought a lot for you to share.

824
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,316
Mom, not now.

825
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,986
You know, you have to line up
for our dumplings these days.

826
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,071
These are a delicacy.

827
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,240
Mom, they don't like dumplings here.

828
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,161
Oh, no. I really have to go.

829
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,829
-Just eat one before you go.
-Mom, stop.

830
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,956
I mean, just take one in your mouth.

831
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,874
Mom!

832
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,376
I said I don't want it!

833
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,379
I'm busy! I'm working right now!

834
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,175
Gosh, that temper of yours.

835
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,345
That temper.

836
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,056
I told you I didn't want it.

837
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,349
All right!

838
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,773
You'll come later after work, right?

839
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,651
Yeah.

840
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,278
What time? When?

841
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,198
Are you going to eat first?
Do you want me to steam these and wait?

842
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,616
I don't know.

843
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,701
-I have to go.
-Okay, go.

844
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,744
-Mom.
-What?

845
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,162
Please don't talk about me, okay?

846
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,581
-I won't.
-Seriously, don't.

847
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,083
-I'm going.
-Go.

848
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,679
Your father's coming
for Chuseok this year.

849
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,888
He called this afternoon.

850
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,807
-He is?
-Yeah.

851
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,560
He said it'd be hard on you
and your sister to visit him.

852
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,146
Well, I don't mind.

853
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,357
You didn't tell him, right?

854
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,984
About what?

855
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,196
About my infertility treatment.

856
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,240
You didn't tell him
I'm doing it again, right?

857
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,826
I didn't. Don't worry.

858
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,454
For what? It'd obviously just upset him.

859
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,623
-Good job.
-Yeah.

860
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,918
By the way, why did you cry
in your sleep last night?

861
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,176
I dreamed about that day again.

862
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,262
The day you cried the most in your life?

863
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,180
Yeah.

864
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,851
This time, I was crying in my dream,

865
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,481
but my throat closed up,
and I really couldn't breathe.

866
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,067
I couldn't even scream
and woke up flailing.

867
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,820
You remember that day?

868
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,864
Of course.

869
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,533
I saw your sister cry
for the first time then.

870
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,119
Yi-young?

871
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,704
Yeah, in front of the bathroom.

872
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,542
She scolded me for crying so much.

873
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,211
I can't believe her.

874
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,068
One shot please, Doctor.

875
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,070
FOLLITROPIN

876
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,242
Here we go again.

877
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,661
Yeah.

878
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,249
I really hope this will be the last time.

879
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,751
Please.

880
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,296
Ms. Oh, please take a seat here.

881
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,297
Okay.

882
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,927
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

883
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:36,971
Okay.

884
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,683
We'll disinfect first.

885
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,767
Okay.

886
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,894
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

887
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,397
Nam-kyung did?

888
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,314
Yeah.

889
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,108
In middle school,

890
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:53,070
she studied all the time
and didn't really hang out with friends.

891
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,575
During field trips and field days,
she was always alone.

892
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,369
But am I talking too much about her?

893
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,329
No, it's so interesting.

894
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,873
It's totally different
from the Nam-kyung I know.

895
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,502
Well, the thing is

896
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,506
she brightened up a bit after college.

897
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,967
According to her, after the surgery,

898
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,844
her personality changed or whatever.

899
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,220
Surgery?

900
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,848
-Her nose--
-Fillers!

901
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,808
It wasn't surgery! They were fillers!

902
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,436
Mom, stop and just go to sleep!

903
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,895
Goodness, you scared me!

904
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,981
Gosh, instead of your nose,

905
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,442
they should've fixed your temper.

906
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,111
How many times
do I have to tell you they were fillers?

907
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,280
Gosh, who'd put up
with that kind of temper?

908
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,574
That's why she's never dated
and is always alone.

909
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,658
What?

910
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,953
Others have boyfriends
and go on blind dates, but she doesn't.

911
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,080
Who knows if she'll ever get married?

912
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,708
That's not true.

913
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,835
-She had a guy named Gi-dong--
-Hey, Sa-bi!

914
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,714
You need to sleep now
so you can heal faster.

915
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,466
You said you wanted to get back to work.

916
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,552
Sleep.

917
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,645
But I think

918
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,980
I'm pretty lucky.

919
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,526
All of my daughter's friends
are doctors and nurses.

920
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,822
Even my hospital roommate is her friend.

921
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,579
I told you to just go home and sleep.

922
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,956
Why sleep here?

923
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,084
Because it's a hassle.

924
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,503
But you said your lounge has beds.

925
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,629
Whatever.

926
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,090
Mom, I'm going to sleep now.
You should sleep too.

927
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,016
By the way…

928
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,187
my surgery tomorrow

929
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,272
really is minor, right?

930
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,525
There are no minor surgeries.

931
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,193
Gosh, that startled me.

932
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,698
If it was serious,
would I be here right now?

933
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,117
You think I'd be able to sleep?

934
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,209
You won't be in the operating room

935
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,669
for my surgery, right?

936
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,962
I can't.

937
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,131
I have another surgery.

938
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,717
You didn't tell me,
so I had no time to change my schedule.

939
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,053
Good. Don't come.

940
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,556
I'm still going with you to the OR.

941
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,473
Don't worry.

942
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,892
I won't.

943
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,729
Mom, I'm so sleepy.

944
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,858
You should go to sleep too.

945
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,359
Sleep, sleep.

946
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,072
Good night.

947
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,326
Good night.

948
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,514
What's with him?

949
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,185
Hey!

950
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,562
Have you been possessed
by a workaholic ghost?

951
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,771
Go away!

952
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,357
Everyone's busy.
The least I can do is not be a burden.

953
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,067
Geez.

954
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,946
It's my third POD,
and I'm still being prescribed mucolytics.

955
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,531
I think we can discontinue that.

956
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,241
Let's just discharge you now.

957
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,869
I'd like to, but Prof. Jo said no.

958
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,454
Isn't Dr. Ryu your doctor?

959
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,622
He is.

960
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,292
But Prof. Jo said my hemoglobin levels
were still low so I should rest more.

961
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,460
He saw your chart?

962
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,213
That's a surprise.

963
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,299
I don't know. Maybe he's bored.

964
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,136
Oh, right!

965
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,472
For Ms. Kim Seon-yu,

966
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,475
it seems we'll have to remove
more of her bowel than expected.

967
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,060
-Ms. Kim Seon-yu?
-Yeah.

968
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,358
We're consulting with General Surgery.

969
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,693
She needs surgery and cancer treatment.

970
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,529
How many days has she been on TPN for?

971
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,365
Damn it.

972
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,166
You should take it easy
and rest even at home.

973
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,087
If there's vaginal bleeding again,
come straight to the delivery room.

974
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,547
Yes, I will.

975
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,423
Your due in two months, right?

976
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,469
Let me know when the baby comes.

977
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,180
Me too.

978
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,431
And send some photos.

979
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,353
In that case,
since you know all our numbers,

980
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,146
make a group chat and let us know.

981
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,233
Gosh, I'm jealous.

982
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,610
All I want is to be able to go home too.

983
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,861
You will too.

984
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,495
How can you eat more of those?

985
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,706
You ate a bunch in your ward earlier.

986
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,791
Yeah, I had some
at the nurses' station too.

987
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,543
The GYN ward's having a dumpling party.

988
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,752
The OB ward too.

989
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,298
Wherever the dumplings went got a ton
of fun facts about Nam-kyung too.

990
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,424
Princess Pyo.

991
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,969
I told Mom not to talk about me.

992
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,096
It turns out their dumpling place
is super famous.

993
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,764
It's a popular spot in that area.

994
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm so jealous of you, Nam-kyung.

995
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,893
You get to eat dumplings and see your mom.

996
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,811
What?

997
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,188
My parents live abroad.

998
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,024
They run a laundromat in the US.

999
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,650
How did you know?

1000
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,319
If you search "Um Jay,"
it's all online.

1001
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,446
Impressive.

1002
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,745
Hey, Sa-bi.

1003
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,497
Mom wants to know your address
so she can send you steamed buns.

1004
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,874
Really? When? A lot?

1005
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,208
-What about me?
-Me too!

1006
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,505
But why steamed buns and not dumplings?

1007
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,007
She asked me what I like.

1008
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,425
And I said I like red beans.

1009
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,927
I just said it in passing.

1010
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,262
But she has a great memory.

1011
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,388
My mom?

1012
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,473
Yeah.

1013
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,142
The lunches she packed
for your elementary school field trips.

1014
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,269
Flowers she bought
for your high school graduation.

1015
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,354
She remembers it all.

1016
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,149
My mom never came
to any of my graduations.

1017
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,067
It made me jealous.

1018
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,943
What's there to be jealous of?

1019
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,779
Your mom's a big-shot doctor.
That's great.

1020
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,031
-What's great about that?
-What's not great about that?

1021
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,699
At least your moms are in the country.

1022
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,701
Geez, you're all are so immature.

1023
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,745
At least you have moms.

1024
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,874
Isn't that enough? You're so greedy.

1025
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,426
I should get going. Bye!

1026
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,928
-Good luck!
-Thanks.

1027
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,435
BEWARE OF FALLING

1028
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,522
Our professor's famous
for being a good surgeon.

1029
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,066
He could do yours with his eyes closed.

1030
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,527
I know.

1031
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,780
But you said you had surgery.
Don't you have to go?

1032
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,574
After I see you go in, I have to go.

1033
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,203
You can do this, right?

1034
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,124
I won't be doing anything.
The doctors will.

1035
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,334
It'll be over in an hour.

1036
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,129
Just think of it as taking a nice nap.

1037
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,046
Okay.

1038
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,132
Goodness.

1039
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,096
-Mom.
-Yeah?

1040
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,681
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

1041
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,563
We'll go in now.

1042
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,690
Please take good care of her.

1043
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,941
Don't worry.

1044
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,193
We'll take you in now.

1045
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,197
I can do it!

1046
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,657
I can do it.

1047
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,427
Excuse me, Doctor.

1048
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,762
Please take good care of her.

1049
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,929
She's my mom.

1050
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,765
Yes, I heard.

1051
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,017
It's a simple procedure, so…

1052
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,144
Well, you already know.

1053
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,103
Yes.

1054
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,354
Doctor.

1055
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,900
My mom really can't stand the cold.

1056
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,818
When the surgery's over,

1057
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,654
could you put a few more blankets on her?

1058
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,989
Yes, I will.

1059
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,574
Thank you.

1060
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,123
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

1061
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,416
Hi, San and Deul!

1062
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,545
Are you back from preschool?

1063
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,464
Did you eat?

1064
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,758
Yes, we did!

1065
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:39,054
I'm really going to come home soon now.

1066
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,639
When?

1067
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,682
Well,

1068
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,102
after two more sleeps, I'll be home.

1069
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,646
Really?

1070
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:50,482
I was supposed to go after ten sleeps,

1071
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,860
but I missed you both so much,
so I'm coming sooner.

1072
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,445
And the baby?

1073
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,405
And the baby?

1074
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,576
Let me ask

1075
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,038
if the baby

1076
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,456
can come with me.

1077
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,624
Okay.

1078
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,793
Watch some TV and play.

1079
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:11,837
I love you.

1080
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,049
-I love you.
-I love you.

1081
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,336
The routine NST
didn't show any issues this morning.

1082
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,381
But she said just a bit ago
the baby wasn't moving well.

1083
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,134
So we did another NST,

1084
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,635
and we couldn't get a heartbeat.

1085
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,471
We did an ultrasonography,

1086
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,391
and it seems to be an IUFD.

1087
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,896
Any other symptoms?

1088
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,983
The lab results were fine
with no other symptoms of note.

1089
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,281
So what do we do now?

1090
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,868
I'll move her to tomorrow's first surgery
and tell her guardian to come.

1091
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,829
Right. Then…

1092
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,331
What do I do now?

1093
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,207
What?

1094
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,294
I don't know if there's a point

1095
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,589
in giving a medical explanation.

1096
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,342
And when I think about it as a fellow mom,

1097
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,928
it makes it even harder to talk about.

1098
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,014
If I tell her I have no words,

1099
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,141
that would be meaningless.

1100
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,478
I don't know what to say to her.

1101
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,299
To explain the procedure…

1102
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,134
I'll do it. Just prepare the consent form.

1103
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,052
No.

1104
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,847
I will do it.

1105
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,699
The abdomen was clean with no adhesions.

1106
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,243
The cyst looked completely benign
even to the naked eye.

1107
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,577
That's a relief.

1108
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,997
They were done in twenty minutes,

1109
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,123
so she should be fine.

1110
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,290
Right.

1111
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,754
Her belly was stitched up nicely too.

1112
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,172
You're right.

1113
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,340
Goodness.

1114
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,259
I remembered you said
she easily gets cold,

1115
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,219
so I put three more blankets
when she came out.

1116
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,137
You did?

1117
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,639
Hey, you're a patient too, you know.

1118
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,266
Right. That's why I know.

1119
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,893
You didn't have to do that.

1120
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,441
Mom, are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

1121
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,194
It hurts.

1122
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,075
Ma'am, it's normal for it to hurt a lot.

1123
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:33,413
You just had surgery, so it'll feel like
your ribs and back are being crushed.

1124
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,458
It's going to hurt
for a few more hours.

1125
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,626
It won't be okay for a bit.

1126
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,505
I'll be her doctor for today.

1127
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,631
I'm not busy anyway.

1128
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,467
Thanks, Sa-bi.

1129
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,767
Mom, I have to go.

1130
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,561
If it hurts, don't bear it.

1131
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,687
Tell Sa-bi.

1132
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,564
She'll give you some painkillers, okay?

1133
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,317
Bye. Thanks.

1134
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,195
Nam-kyung.

1135
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,698
What? What is it, Mom?

1136
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,827
Don't eat bread.

1137
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,164
Eat a proper meal.

1138
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,837
Why would I eat at this hour?

1139
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,256
Have a proper meal.

1140
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,675
Okay, I will.

1141
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:43,858
You should eat.

1142
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,072
It's been a long time since lunch.

1143
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,141
Suddenly…

1144
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,562
something so unexpected happened.

1145
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,608
You've been through a lot.

1146
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,613
Doctor.

1147
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,866
Yes?

1148
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,751
The surgery's in the morning.

1149
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,753
You have to fast starting from midnight.

1150
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,214
And you can't eat
for six hours after surgery.

1151
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,341
Okay.

1152
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,843
So…

1153
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,764
If you don't eat now,

1154
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,602
you'll get hungry later on.

1155
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,568
Then…

1156
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,741
you'll hate yourself
for being hungry at a time like this

1157
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,368
and wonder if you deserve to be a mom.

1158
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,337
That's what my sister told me.

1159
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,049
She usually doesn't cry much.

1160
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,180
But she cried a lot then.

1161
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,808
When she woke up the next morning,

1162
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,478
she cried because she was hungry.

1163
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,983
She was afraid
the baby would be hungry too.

1164
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,820
She thought since she didn't eat,

1165
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,282
maybe the baby
couldn't eat anything either.

1166
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,077
I told her

1167
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,622
the baby didn't need food anymore.

1168
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,959
But it didn't help.

1169
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,679
It's already been more than five years,

1170
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,765
but sometimes,
she still dreams about that day.

1171
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,856
So,

1172
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,442
even if you have to force yourself,
try to eat.

1173
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,862
You must be so sad,

1174
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,740
so at least you won't have to
think about this.

1175
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,024
That's good.

1176
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,026
It doesn't hurt? Your stomach isn't sore?

1177
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,820
No, they must've done a good job.

1178
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,740
Did you take the pain meds?

1179
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,160
Yeah, Dr. Sa-bi was with me
and made sure I took them on time.

1180
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,915
She said you two were the closest.

1181
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:09,832
What?

1182
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,710
Yeah.

1183
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,878
I guess.

1184
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,546
Were you busy today too?

1185
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,839
Of course.

1186
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,300
I have another surgery to go to later.

1187
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,470
What kind?

1188
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,805
Would you know if I told you?

1189
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,687
I mean, which professor's surgery is it?

1190
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,355
The one I always talk about.

1191
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,439
The Witch?

1192
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,357
No.

1193
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,570
The one who always screams in the OR?

1194
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,073
What was it? It was "Devil" something.

1195
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,991
Kong… what was it?

1196
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,285
Mom, be quiet. Someone will hear you!

1197
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,286
No.

1198
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,831
If I ever run into them here,

1199
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,416
I'll give her a piece of my mind.

1200
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,500
You're allowed to scold.

1201
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,419
But why scream at all of you?

1202
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,962
They must be insane!

1203
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,255
What are you saying?

1204
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,215
You better not, okay?

1205
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,258
Dr. Pyo?

1206
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,637
Hello, Professor.

1207
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,889
Isn't our surgery soon?
What are you doing?

1208
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,058
Nothing, ma'am.

1209
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,560
I was just leaving.

1210
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,815
Hello, Professor.

1211
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,026
I'm…

1212
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,115
Nam-kyung's mother.

1213
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,034
Hello.

1214
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,579
I'm Prof. Kong Gi-sun,

1215
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,706
and I work with Nam-kyung.

1216
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:33,833
Was your surgery all right?

1217
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:34,917
Yes.

1218
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,839
Nam-kyung's told me

1219
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,633
all about you.

1220
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:48,806
Look,

1221
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,434
Professor…

1222
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,606
my Nam-kyung…

1223
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,365
still has a long way to go.

1224
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,535
I did my best to raise her,

1225
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,163
but you might find her difficult at times.

1226
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,791
I'm so worried
she might be inconveniencing

1227
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,168
all the amazing doctors here.

1228
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,086
I'm very sorry.

1229
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,922
Gosh, no.

1230
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,841
Our Dr. Pyo is an amazing doctor.

1231
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,095
Gosh, thank you so much.

1232
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,767
My daughter's doing something meaningful
thanks to her wonderful professor.

1233
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,602
Please take good care of her.

1234
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,520
Gosh.

1235
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,563
Don't you worry.

1236
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,568
Take your time, Dr. Pyo.

1237
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,904
Have a good night.

1238
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,115
-See you soon.
-Good night.

1239
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,579
Geez, you scared me!

1240
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,497
Kong?

1241
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,082
Yeah, that's her.

1242
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,500
The screamer.

1243
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,001
Quiet, she'll hear you.

1244
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,839
Stop joking around!

1245
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,426
Is it nice to be back?

1246
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,513
They told you to take the weekend off.

1247
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,933
All right, that's a good attitude to have.

1248
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,727
Let me know if you need more work.
You can have some of mine.

1249
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,604
Me too! I have loads to give too.

1250
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,147
We'll see.

1251
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,234
I'm buying to celebrate my return.

1252
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,654
Chocolate Honey Pong Crush for me.

1253
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,572
Me too.

1254
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,240
Two Chocolate Honey Pong Crushes,

1255
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,450
one hot Americano,

1256
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,910
and for Nam-kyung…

1257
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,079
A mega iced Americano.

1258
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:35,997
All right.

1259
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,292
And one hot peppermint tea, please.

1260
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:40,918
That's five total, right?

1261
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,086
Yes, that's right.

1262
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,170
Thank you.

1263
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,381
One of these too.

1264
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,093
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1265
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,391
Your appointment's next week, right?

1266
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,728
If you feel dizzy
or pain in the surgery site,

1267
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,438
don't wait and just come.

1268
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:01,647
-I can come right away?
-Yes.

1269
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,691
Gosh, thank you so much.

1270
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,193
And please take good care of my Nam-kyung.

1271
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,322
It's so reassuring to know
she has such good friends.

1272
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:17,955
You can close the shop for a day.

1273
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,665
You should eat lunch before you go.

1274
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,542
Your Dad's working so hard all by himself.

1275
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,046
Tell your friends

1276
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,007
I said thanks for coming to say goodbye,

1277
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,217
for liking my dumplings,

1278
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,387
and for being your good friends.

1279
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:34,847
All right.

1280
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,558
I could take the bus.

1281
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,435
You just got discharged.
You can take a taxi.

1282
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,686
I'm fine though.

1283
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,147
Mom, it's already been paid for.

1284
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,274
You'll waste money
if you don't take it. You sure?

1285
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,610
Gosh, why waste money
on something like that?

1286
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,529
Just take it.
Skipping one taxi ride won't make us rich.

1287
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,406
Okay, don't get all frustrated.

1288
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,579
Mom, don't come here anymore.

1289
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,832
I'm busy as it is.

1290
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,543
You being here is a hassle for me.

1291
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,171
Geez.

1292
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,756
So,

1293
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,675
don't get sick.

1294
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,930
Okay.

1295
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,065
Were you scared
when they sent you to a big hospital?

1296
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,066
Yeah.

1297
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:31,737
My vision blurred and my heart raced.

1298
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,574
Were you scared of the surgery?

1299
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,159
Yeah.

1300
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,370
I almost…

1301
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,331
cried.

1302
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,459
The hospital bed was uncomfortable too.

1303
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,628
It was tough, wasn't it?

1304
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,505
No.

1305
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,510
I had a really nice time.

1306
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,053
What?

1307
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,347
It was the first time
since you were in middle school

1308
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,766
that we got to sleep together like that.

1309
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,352
For me,

1310
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:07,481
it was a really happy three days.

1311
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,487
Why are you saying that?

1312
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,989
My gosh, what's with you?

1313
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,618
Look at this.

1314
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,245
Goodness.

1315
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,998
After always yelling at me
with that temper…

1316
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,670
Mom.

1317
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,214
Don't cry.

1318
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,674
Mom.

1319
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,302
Stop crying, okay?

1320
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:37,762
Okay.

1321
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,306
-Don't cry.
-Mom.

1322
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,016
Don't cry.

1323
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,813
Mom.

1324
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,155
You're still a baby, aren't you?

1325
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,622
You're eating by yourselves again?

1326
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,082
-Hello.
-Hello.

1327
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,209
Did your mom get home well, Nam-kyung?

1328
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,585
Yes, she did.

1329
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,128
Goodness. You did a great job.

1330
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,379
Thank you.

1331
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,054
Isn't that Yi-young's phone?

1332
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,931
Gosh, she's so absent-minded.

1333
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,474
She was in such a rush.

1334
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:26,393
If I hadn't told her,
she would've left with her scrubs on.

1335
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,148
Pick it up.

1336
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,447
Hello, this is Oh Yi-young's phone.

1337
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,367
"Are you a thief?" she says.

1338
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,035
Can't you tell by my voice?

1339
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,246
You left your phone at the lounge.

1340
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,374
I'll put it on your desk,
so take it later.

1341
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:49,834
Bye.

1342
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,045
Did Yi-young go somewhere?

1343
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:54,964
She had dinner plans.

1344
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,799
With who?

1345
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,343
I don't know who, but I think it's a guy.

1346
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,178
How do you know that?

1347
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,973
Remember that story
about her friend or whatever?

1348
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:04,890
That?

1349
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,643
You weren't there,
so you don't know, right?

1350
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,436
Someone asked her to dinner,

1351
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,940
but she asked if it was because
he was thankful or he liked her.

1352
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:14,483
And?

1353
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:15,985
That it was about her friend.

1354
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,279
Yeah, right. It was totally about her.

1355
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,281
Have you ever seen her meet a friend?

1356
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,158
-No.
-Right?

1357
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,409
She's going to see a guy.

1358
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,452
Welcome.

1359
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,996
The name your reservation is under?

1360
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,747
Ham Dong-ho.

1361
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,792
-We'll take you to your room.
-Room?

1362
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,252
This way.

1363
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,179
Here is your room.

1364
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,524
Come in.

1365
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,916
You didn't show,
so we were scared you had an emergency.

1366
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:12,833
You don't, right?

1367
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:13,959
That's right.

1368
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:17,630
Dr. Ham said he has ordered for us.

1369
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,840
We can have a drink tonight, right?
Take a seat.

1370
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:20,925
Come on!

1371
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,927
Yeah, we all went through
that night together.

1372
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,011
So we should celebrate.

1373
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,346
Of course we should.

1374
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,680
We saved a baby.

1375
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,934
Weren't we so cool that night?

1376
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,060
Right, Dr. Oh?

1377
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,062
I guess so.

1378
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,232
I think you were the coolest, Dr. Oh.

1379
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,734
But why are you here?

1380
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:41,111
That really hurts my feelings.

1381
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,947
I'm the one who found Dr. Ku.

1382
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,823
That was the turning point
of that surgery.

1383
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,408
So of course I should be here.

1384
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,077
Of course. "Make the cut deeper."

1385
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,412
Dr. Ku made my heart skip!

1386
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,081
I'll mix the drinks.

1387
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,212
Sometimes, Dr. Ku acts like
he's the lead in a medical drama.

1388
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,755
But he really was cool.

1389
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:00,965
-Really.
-Wait.

1390
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,133
Yi-young, mix the drinks deeper.

1391
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,553
What are you talking about?

1392
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,764
What is that laugh?

1393
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,099
Here you go!

1394
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,475
Thank you.

1395
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:12,768
Good job, everyone!

1396
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,645
-Good job!
-Good job!

1397
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,696
-Which way are you going?
-I'm…

1398
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:24,863
-I'm this way.
-Me too.

1399
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,282
-I'm going this way.
-Me too.

1400
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,158
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow!

1401
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,243
See you tomorrow!

1402
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,995
-What's going on, you two?
-Bye, Yi-young!

1403
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,038
-They make a cute couple.
-Yeah.

1404
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:37,251
I never thought Dong-ho
would treat us to such a nice place.

1405
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,377
Right?

1406
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,670
I wish he told us earlier.

1407
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,256
Who makes plans the day before?
I almost didn't make it.

1408
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,925
That's better than me.
He only texted me this morning.

1409
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,469
Who cares? Nothing beats a free meal.

1410
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,097
Hey, how about another drink?

1411
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,349
-I have to take care of my kid.
-I have work tomorrow.

1412
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,018
I have to go home and watch TV.

1413
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:00,774
Are you going home?

1414
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,651
No, to the hospital.

1415
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,820
I left my phone there.

1416
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,075
-About today…
-Yes?

1417
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,037
Did you think it would just be us two?

1418
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,954
No.

1419
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,958
I was worried you'd think it was a date.

1420
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,126
Not at all.

1421
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,963
I'm not the type to easily be mistaken

1422
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,965
or misunderstand things like that.

1423
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,384
I see.

1424
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,762
Now that I think about it,

1425
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,889
I don't think I told you
I invited the others.

1426
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,309
It's okay. I had fun.

1427
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:37,686
All right.

1428
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,606
Thank you so much for the meal.

1429
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:42,608
You're welcome.

1430
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,153
Can I ask you something though?

1431
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:49,448
You don't have to answer.

1432
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:52,409
Let's hear it first.

1433
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,747
The person you like…

1434
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,082
How did you know?

1435
01:12:59,083 --> 01:12:59,917
So it's true.

1436
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:02,669
No one knows about that.

1437
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,048
I never told anyone.

1438
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,717
That may be so, but it was obvious.

1439
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:12,388
We have the best viewing spot in the room.

1440
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,140
Sa-bi's discharge party?

1441
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,101
No, I have dinner plans tomorrow.

1442
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,021
How many times do I have to repeat this?

1443
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,940
I'm substituting for Sa-bi's surgery.

1444
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,235
Three deliveries in a row.

1445
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,404
Are the patient's results in?

1446
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,239
Yes, they are.

1447
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:32,157
Here.

1448
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,077
We'll deliver the baby
and remove the ovarian cyst today.

1449
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,831
It's larger than expected
and stuck in the back.

1450
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,000
There may be some adhesions.

1451
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,509
Then are we removing this cyst as well?

1452
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,593
That's the bladder.

1453
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:53,679
Right, thank you.

1454
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,473
I'll go check on Ms. Seong's OR.

1455
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,391
Okay.

1456
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:12,739
I see.

1457
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:15,993
So it's that obvious.

1458
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,332
Isn't it tough to have a one-sided crush?

1459
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,500
It is tough.

1460
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,462
These days,
I'm smiling, but not on the inside.

1461
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,173
Then…

1462
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,259
Can't you stop?

1463
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,226
How about me?

1464
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:52,905
I've never thought about it.

1465
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,410
The one I like
much more than I appear to is…

1466
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,162
Dr. Ku Do-won.

1467
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,251
I'm sorry.

1468
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,255
No need to be sorry.

1469
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,218
I understand.

1470
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,178
Then…

1471
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:20,807
I'll have to hope you two don't work out.

1472
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:22,601
What?

1473
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,811
I'll be jealous if it works out.

1474
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:28,398
Gosh.

1475
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:31,235
I'm not giving you any ORs from now on.

1476
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,986
Hey, you can't do that.

1477
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,363
Whatever. It's my choice.

1478
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,532
I didn't realize how petty you were.

1479
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,824
Yes, very.

1480
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,410
Still, you can't let
personal feelings affect work.

1481
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,328
Whatever.

1482
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:43,288
You can't say that. You're a doctor!

1483
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,800
KU DO-WON

1484
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,012
CALL ME WHEN YOU FIND YOUR PHONE

1485
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,110
You didn't bring your car?

1486
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:14,820
No.

1487
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:17,447
By the way,

1488
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,827
did you wait to explain
the consent form to me?

1489
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:23,537
We can do that tomorrow.

1490
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,166
I can handle that much on my own now.

1491
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,712
No, I just thought I might as well…

1492
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:33,422
And I had some work left.

1493
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,133
Did you eat?

1494
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:38,594
Yes, with Dr. Ham.

1495
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,265
And the team from that hectic surgery.

1496
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,350
We all celebrated together.

1497
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,148
I had black bean noodles
and sweet and sour pork too.

1498
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:52,566
And yangjangpi.

1499
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:54,776
And I had four flower buns.

1500
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:01,366
You ate a lot.

1501
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,588
I wish I could do that.

1502
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:17,841
What?

1503
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,636
I want to do that too.

1504
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,304
Here?

1505
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:27,392
Now?

1506
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,519
Yes.

1507
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:37,944
Would that be okay?

1508
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:43,950
I'm…

1509
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:48,246
Well…

1510
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:51,667
I'm not so sure.

1511
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:53,627
But I keep…

1512
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,422
thinking about you.

1513
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:05,222
My legs hurt a lot
after walking from the hospital.

1514
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:07,557
Want to sit too?

1515
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,351
Is it too cramped?

1516
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,170
ELEVATED HEART RATE

1517
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:01,671
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST,
SHIN HYUN-BEEN, OUR ETERNAL JANG GYEO-UL

1518
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:05,425
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1519
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:06,551
Filming?

1520
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,679
They want to see our everyday work lives.

1521
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,681
Just be yourself. Don't force anything.

1522
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:14,017
And it was in front of film crew
on their first day here.

1523
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,602
Right place, right time.

1524
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:18,396
It just feels like
the way we met was fate.

1525
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,608
They said a natural birth
was essential for the baby's health.

1526
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,026
Prep with that in mind.

1527
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,279
She forgets to do her own work,
but gets on my case to do better.

1528
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,781
"Did you do it? Are you going to?"

1529
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,825
It's better than "Do it again"
without checking!

1530
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,201
Then check it again now.

1531
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,285
Again, again!

1532
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,286
Hey, be quiet!

1533
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,705
-I'm upset!
-I'm upset!

1534
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,582
Look at this. I knew this would happen.

1535
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,835
"Born in 1996.
Horoscope for second week of October."

1536
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,795
"A week of war
with fights breaking out often."

1537
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,129
That's so annoying!

1538
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,257
I usually don't get angry
at anyone so easily.

1539
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,634
But why do you keep making
ridiculous mistakes?

1540
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:48,760
It can happen.

1541
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,054
Today's his first day at GYN,
so it's hectic for him.

1542
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,390
Are you trying to lure him over to OB-GYN?

1543
01:20:53,473 --> 01:20:54,683
I might not know everything,

1544
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,893
but I know how to steal someone's heart.

1545
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,230
It's you, right? HI-BOYZ!

1546
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,150
Did I tell you about our trip?

1547
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,485
A trip? All of a sudden?

1548
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:07,863
They'll be gone for a few days.

1549
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:09,906
I think they said for four days.

1550
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,123
