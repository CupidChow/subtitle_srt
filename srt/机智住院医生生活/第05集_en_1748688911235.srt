Cheers!

EPISODE 5

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,566
What department is your boyfriend in?

5
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,735
- You promised to tell us.
Well…

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,821
Should I tell you an interesting story?

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,489
You're curious, right?

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,950
It's the story of my first delivery.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,744
You tell that story at every team dinner.

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,912
Give it a rest, Twenty Questions.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,499
That's rich coming from you,
Screaming Devil!

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,877
Please tell me, Professor.
I'm really curious.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,337
I was a first-year,
and it was the third week of September.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,047
It was a Sunday, right?
Yeah.

15
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,926
All the professors had gone
to a conference in Busan.

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:58,016
Then, a perfectly fine patient
suddenly went into labor.

17
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,393
And I was the only one there
who could deliver the baby.

18
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,355
When I called the professor,
I was told, "Prepare promptly!"

19
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,358
and to deliver it well.

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,738
Gosh, you could already see
the baby's head.

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,281
Oh, no. Really?

22
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,826
Hey, who was the one who called pediatrics
because the baby wasn't breathing?

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,370
If I hadn't called them and performed NRP,

24
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,663
you wouldn't be here.

25
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,000
A baby less than 30 weeks old
and barely weighing 1 kg

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,044
was trying to pop out.

27
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,506
I heard you have to be careful
with their heads if they're too premature.

28
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,716
Did you perform an episiotomy?
I did!

29
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,762
Just as I was picking up
the episiotomy scissors…

30
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,806
Um Jae-il!

31
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,309
"CHEER UP" by TWICE!

32
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,937
Correct.

33
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,774
I didn't hear anything.
How could he get it so quickly?

34
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,691
Everyone,

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,527
I'm a former idol.

36
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,783
Okay, next question.

37
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,204
Um Jae-il!

38
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:05,500
"Eve, Psyche & the Bluebeard's Wife"
by LE SSERAFIM.

39
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,462
He really got it right!

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,799
He really got it.
Next question, please!

41
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,634
Gi-dong, just hear me out.

42
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,802
No, listen.

43
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,846
Why didn't you answer your phone?

44
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,013
Me?

45
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,058
I'm working, so of course
I can't answer the phone.

46
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,893
But you don't even work.

47
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,437
She's drunk, isn't she?
Let's talk tomorrow.

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,856
You want to break up?

49
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,276
Hey, fine. Let's break up.

50
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,278
That's what I've been wanting to say.

51
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,654
I think she just got dumped too.

52
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,198
You wanted to break up first,
so don't call me--

53
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,033
Hello?

54
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,785
Hey.

55
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,706
Pick up, Hong Gi-dong.

56
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,293
If you don't pick up, we're done.

57
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,837
Your call could not be connected.
After the tone, please…

58
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,053
Dried pollack.

59
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,639
Is the dried pollack out now?

60
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,898
It really didn't work out.

61
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,778
Excuse me.

62
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,364
Excuse me, I'm…

63
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,408
I'm sorry, but…

64
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,286
Could we…

65
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,790
If you don't mind, could we sit--

66
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,042
No, you can't sit with me.

67
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,129
I'm having a get-together
with my colleagues.

68
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,048
And I already have someone I like.

69
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,051
Good night then.

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,183
No, I…

71
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,352
That's not what I meant.

72
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,938
That's our dried pollack.

73
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,566
That's ours.

74
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,448
Weren't you
in the Yulje OB-GYN get-together?

75
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,034
That get-together

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,453
just ended.

77
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,003
Oh Yi-young.

78
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,562
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,336
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

80
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
Joo-young!

81
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,416
Hurry up!

82
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,461
She's going to be the death of me!

83
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,390
Why put on sunscreen
when you'll be stuck in the hospital?

84
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,975
I know, right?

85
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,352
Do you even remember
how you got home last night?

86
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,354
Just how much alcohol did you drink?

87
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,566
Joo-young, I think my body
has gotten weak lately.

88
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,319
I only had a few glasses,
and I got tipsy right away.

89
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,279
Did you make any mistakes while drinking?

90
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,989
You said you were with your colleagues.

91
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,034
Of course not. How old do you think I am?

92
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,336
What's wrong?

93
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,587
What's with that expression?

94
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,339
Hey!

95
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,757
Cheers!

96
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,929
I heard our juniors gave us new nicknames.

97
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,764
No. We didn't.

98
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,475
Oh, come on.
We know you guys have names for us.

99
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,434
What are they?

100
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,852
There really aren't any.

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,395
I swear.

102
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,108
No.

103
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,859
No. Nothing happened.

104
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,611
Nothing happened at all.

105
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,570
No.

106
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,488
Are you sure?

107
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,118
You didn't start blabbering
and blast people with harsh truths, right?

108
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,037
What?

109
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,164
What?

110
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,673
It's okay. I'm just really curious.

111
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,678
What were they again?

112
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,887
Legends?

113
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,765
Our heroes?

114
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,433
Stop being so boring.

115
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,185
We're not that old-fashioned.

116
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,353
What are they?

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,194
Don't.

118
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,698
Don't, don't, don't.

119
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,283
Twenty Questions.

120
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,535
What's that?

121
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,246
You suffocate us to death
with never-ending questions

122
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,165
whenever you open your mouth.

123
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,877
That's hilarious.

124
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,213
Kids these days come up
with the best nicknames.

125
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,257
The Screaming Devil.

126
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,304
It means you're a devil
who screams all the time.

127
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,388
Clever, right?

128
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,142
That's interesting.

129
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,186
That's very interesting.

130
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,439
You're Malig--

131
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,649
That hurts!

132
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,237
Geez. You look so innocent,
but your slaps really hurt.

133
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,993
Should we order some dried pollack too?
Sure! I'm down!

134
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,244
Let's do it!

135
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,631
You did do something.

136
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,924
You messed up.

137
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,636
I had a bad feeling when you said
you had a team dinner.

138
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,804
What did I say about drinking?

139
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,889
Answer me.

140
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,766
You said to watch my mouth.

141
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,060
Yes, exactly.
Did you watch your mouth or not?

142
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,314
Geez. You're impossible.

143
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,359
I don't know who said such nonsense

144
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,736
about your sibling
being your best friend in life.

145
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,613
I bet they were an only child.

146
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,116
At least you can end friendships.
You can't even throw your sibling away.

147
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,246
I think I'll be late anyway.
Should I just not go?

148
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,413
Shut your trap.

149
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,671
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

150
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,968
Good morning.

151
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,219
Jesus Christ!

152
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,430
Did you get home safe?

153
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,350
Yes, I did.

154
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,479
Hello.

155
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,397
Hello.

156
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,487
It looked like you drank a lot last night.
Are you okay?

157
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,699
Yes, I'm fine.

158
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,661
Kids these days seem to know
how to have fun without feeling awkward.

159
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,913
Even with professors around,
they speak their minds.

160
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,748
Right, Professor?

161
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,375
Weren't you shocked yesterday?

162
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,086
That's why

163
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,546
it was fun.

164
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,048
That's what get-togethers are all about.

165
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,510
By the way, Yi-young.
Yes?

166
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,015
The data on the preeclampsia patient
seemed to be a bit lacking.

167
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,438
How about compiling about 20 more cases?

168
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,107
Sounds good. Right?

169
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,027
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,365
She's acting so nonchalant.

171
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,576
I just can't figure her out.

172
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,870
Isn't that even more annoying?

173
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,081
No, I actually like it.

174
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,001
Have a good day.

175
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,004
How dare she?

177
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,396
Ma'am, just a moment. She'll be here soon.

178
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,939
Is something wrong?

179
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,442
No, everything will be okay.

180
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,403
It'll be fine.

181
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,868
What? What's going on?

182
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,245
Doctor, she's 12 weeks pregnant.

183
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,372
But I think I see

184
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,541
an ovarian tumor on the ultrasound.

185
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,459
What?

186
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,838
Ma'am, I'm just going to
take a look at something.

187
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,298
Okay.

188
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,927
Is this what you're referring to?

189
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,428
Yes, that.

190
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,013
This

191
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,014
stool?

192
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,974
Excuse me?

193
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,769
And this is…

194
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,316
a rather sizeable piece of stool.

195
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,404
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,200
Ma'am, have you been struggling
to go to the bathroom lately?

197
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,120
Yes, I've always had constipation issues.

198
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,747
But recently, it's gotten worse.

199
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,291
I was going to mention it
during my appointment later.

200
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,795
I'll prescribe you some medication
that's safe to take during pregnancy.

201
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,130
Thank you.

202
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,091
I didn't know ultrasounds
were this detailed though.

203
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,177
Yes, I'll see you later.

204
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,262
Okay.

205
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,730
ULTRASOUND ROOM 15

206
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,694
Dr. Um, did you seriously
call me here during my busy day

207
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,154
just to look at some stool?

208
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,572
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,909
It looked just like
an ovarian teratoma from textbooks.

210
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,536
And you're saying I missed it?

211
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,580
No, that's not what I meant.

212
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,375
Then what? You're saying a tumor this big
suddenly appeared out of nowhere?

213
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,919
Don't you think it's strange

214
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,547
to believe you could see
a tumor in the first place?

215
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,966
Right.

216
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,135
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,514
I doubted it as well,
but I just wanted to make sure--

218
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,932
I have a lot of patients today.

219
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,102
Do you know how much they'll complain
if the wait time increases?

220
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,812
Doctor, I'll teach him right.

221
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,772
I was supervising him,

222
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,525
but I had to stop by
the delivery room for a minute.

223
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,526
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,363
Dr. Um, there's a patient
waiting inside. Go on in.

225
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,532
Can he go?

226
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,826
Go.

227
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,513
Hello.

228
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,056
Hello.
Hello.

229
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,892
Mom, when can I meet my younger sibling?

230
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,644
Just three more nights to go.

231
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,688
Ma'am, take deep breaths.

232
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,357
We're almost there.

233
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,692
Deeper. Take deeper breaths.

234
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,572
About Ms. Jin Gyeong-hye,
who has cervical cancer…

235
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,991
We need to perform a hysterectomy
during the C-section,

236
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,369
so I've scheduled
surgery for next Thursday.

237
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,538
Please check
if Prof. Ryu Jae-hui is available.

238
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,622
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,541
And tell him we'll get the consent form.

240
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,458
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,921
By the way, Professor,
don't you have the triplet delivery today?

242
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,132
Yeah, we're doing a C-section
since the first baby's in breech.

243
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,219
The patient has low platelets,
so we're doing general anesthesia.

244
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,596
I'm worried about excessive bleeding.

245
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,641
Right, did Nam-kyung book
three incubators?

246
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,353
Sorry.

247
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,483
Don't you need to go?

248
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,277
Pardon?
It's time for GYN rounds.

249
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,822
Right. I should get going then.

250
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,761
Oh, dear.

251
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,139
It is a recurrence.

252
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,100
Yes. According to the chart,
she was fine for three years.

253
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,895
But her follow-up CA-125
came back around 123.

254
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,689
And the APCT and chest CT
show signs of recurrence.

255
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,066
I see.

256
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,653
What should we do?

257
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,905
Well…

258
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,368
I'll explain it to her.
Okay.

259
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,580
What's my schedule for today?

260
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,957
You have a myoma surgery at 5:00 p.m.

261
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,168
The patient is on aspirin
due to a history of stroke.

262
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,669
I've arranged a neurology consult.

263
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,880
I've requested a cardiology consult
for her arrhythmia

264
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,590
and ordered an operative risk scan.

265
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,383
You are perfect, Doctor…

266
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,969
Kim Sa-bi.
Right, Dr. Kim Sa-bi.

267
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,054
Sorry.

268
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,351
But, Dr. Kim.

269
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,438
There must be
about 50 fibroids in this surgery.

270
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,940
Fifty?

271
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,358
Yes.

272
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,819
Then, it'll take
about three or four hours.

273
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,821
Yeah, that's right.

274
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,533
But to reduce
the chance of fibroid recurrence,

275
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,162
it's best to remove
as many visible ones as possible.

276
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,706
I see.

277
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,379
People who like OB tend to find GYN a bit

278
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,256
tedious, right?

279
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,887
Right. We do the same thing for hours.

280
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,055
There aren't many

281
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,557
dramatic events either.

282
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,436
Yes, it can be a bit boring
when compared to obstetrics.

283
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,106
What?
Oh, that's not what I meant…

284
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,360
"Boring"?

285
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,112
But you know what?

286
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,864
That's a good thing.

287
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,366
Look.

288
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,369
You've already adapted
and gotten used to it.

289
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,413
You're doing an excellent job.

290
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,790
Is that so?

291
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,958
Absolutely.

292
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,379
So, I'm counting on you
for the surgery later.

293
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,340
Keep up the good work.

294
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,184
Hey.

295
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,396
What's on the menu?

296
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,732
I'm coming right now.

297
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,568
He's not here yet?

298
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,111
He's on his way now.

299
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,320
How old is he?

300
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,156
No, I'll pass. Sorry.

301
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,119
He's your brother's friend?
Then he must be a lawyer too.

302
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,081
No, it's okay. I said I'll do it.

303
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,750
Okay. Send me his number.

304
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,751
Thanks.

305
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,712
Going on another blind date?

306
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,756
Mind your own business.

307
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,883
Didn't you say you had one last month too?

308
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,925
We broke up then.

309
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,511
And now?
Now, we're totally done.

310
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,889
You'll totally get back together again.
Not at all.

311
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,223
This time, it's for real.

312
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,392
You've dated for seven years?

313
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,061
And broke up about 70 times.

314
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,146
That's being a bit dramatic.

315
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,397
I'd say about 50 times.

316
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,400
Where's Jae-il? I'm hungry.

317
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm here! Here's your hot
and fresh tteokbokki!

318
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,201
What great choices.
Great combinations. Who made the order?

319
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,577
You did, didn't you?
Yes.

320
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,246
Are you praising yourself?
These were already in combo sets.

321
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,207
Ordering combo sets was still a good idea.

322
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,418
All right. You can have them all, Sa-bi.

323
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,920
Awesome.
Where's the chicken feet?

324
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,837
Right.

325
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,839
Here you go.

326
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,301
Nam-kyung, you're going
to wear a hole into your phone!

327
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,303
You can't reach your boyfriend?

328
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,763
They're on a break.

329
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,680
Permanently.

330
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,682
Permanently for this month only.
Hey.

331
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,310
I can never tell
if they're together or not.

332
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,395
Whenever I ask,
she always says they broke up.

333
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,191
This one's not spicy.

334
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,276
One original and one mild.

335
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,238
You ordered them.
You don't even know what you ordered.

336
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,573
Why is she so aggressive?
Because they broke up?

337
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,408
They're on a break.
Permanently.

338
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,077
Permanently for this month only.

339
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,120
Hey!

340
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,788
Nam-kyung, your phone.

341
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,417
What now, Mom?

342
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,338
Why are you asking an OB-GYN
about Auntie's leg numbness?

343
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,256
I don't know.

344
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,384
I mean, how would I know that?

345
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,220
Mom, I need to go into surgery. Bye.

346
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,765
Was that your mom?
Yeah.

347
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,351
She always calls when someone's unwell.

348
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,603
She calls about my grandma's indigestion

349
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,355
or my aunt's cough.

350
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,439
As if I'd know.

351
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,567
Don't take it out on us.

352
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,570
She always asks,
"Have you eaten? Are you sleeping well?"

353
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,446
"Why can't you sleep?
Are you cold or hot?"

354
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,739
Geez.

355
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,200
Isn't your mom like that too?

356
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,994
My mom doesn't call me.

357
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,454
Is being indifferent hereditary?

358
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,999
You take after your mom, don't you?
Yeah.

359
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,333
My mom was beautiful.

360
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,670
My mom doesn't seem to care much either.

361
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,840
She's probably just busy.
I heard she's a professor.

362
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,092
How did you know?
Prof. Jo mentioned it.

363
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,760
She's at Bumyeong University Hospital.

364
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,970
That's my dad.

365
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,055
My mom recently moved
to Samho University Hospital.

366
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,056
Are they both doctors?

367
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,808
My brother too.

368
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,436
A family of doctors.

369
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,154
Yes?

370
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,532
What is his problem?

371
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,538
Okay. I'll be there.

372
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,837
You're done eating?

373
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,510
He failed today too.

374
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,683
The intern keeps failing,
so the patients are upset.

375
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,769
I'm upset too.

376
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,521
Still, please don't be too hard on him.

377
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,857
- Is it ABGA again?
Yes.

378
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,400
And…

379
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,237
Tapping too.

380
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,531
DRAINING EXCESS FLUID
FROM THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY WITH A NEEDLE

381
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,049
I poked her right wrist several times,
so it'll hurt a bit.

382
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,135
Damn it.

383
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,596
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,151
She'll make sure to do it
without any pain.

385
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,154
Really?

386
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,115
No.

387
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,992
This will hurt a bit.

388
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,952
It's normally a bit painful.

389
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,123
Gosh. Okay.

390
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,509
I couldn't see
the veins in her wrist at all.

391
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,593
Be quiet.

392
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,766
I've never done this before.

393
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,854
I read that you should touch
the dorsalis pedis artery with one hand

394
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,855
and--

395
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,690
Seriously.

396
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,194
I still have a lot of patients left.

397
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,822
I'm already behind on my work,
so I need to be quick and go.

398
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,615
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,414
If there's something else to work on,
should I help with that?

400
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,500
Forget it. Just stay still.
That's how you can help.

401
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,254
Then maybe I could adjust the bed--

402
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,298
Just shut up and get lost.

403
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,665
Dr. Oh.

404
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:58,835
I know.

405
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,504
It's just that…

406
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,006
I'm so busy.

407
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,343
I was in a hurry and said it by accident.

408
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,929
Even still, "get lost"?
In front of a patient, no less?

409
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,722
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,058
But…

411
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,143
I did make a mistake,

412
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,312
but he deserved to be scolded too.

413
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,524
He said he couldn't do it.
The least he could've done was keep quiet.

414
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,652
He was unable to do it,
so he was blabbering out of embarrassment.

415
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,237
And I never said not to scold him.

416
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,531
But if you're going to do it,
do it in private.

417
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,242
I was too upset
at the time to think about that.

418
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,671
Thanks to you, no one will want
to be treated by Dr. Tak.

419
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,507
I bet the word's already spread
all over the GYN ward.

420
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,342
He's just an intern, okay?

421
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,178
He hasn't been here for even three months.

422
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,348
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,350
Can't you control your anger?

424
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,520
Do you have to lash out to feel better?

425
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,688
Yes.
Hey!

426
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,070
I mean, no. I'll work on it, sir.

427
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,887
You didn't press it.

428
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,347
Right.

429
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,727
You must be very tired.

430
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,192
I raised my voice a bit earlier.

431
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,360
I'm sorry. Are you upset?

432
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,530
It's nothing to be upset about.

433
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,617
And you don't need to apologize either.

434
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,995
I deserved to be scolded.

435
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,956
I apologized to the intern too.

436
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,958
Good. Well done.

437
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,629
Surprisingly, at times,
I notice you actually have common sense.

438
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,552
It's already past midnight.

439
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,641
SATURDAY, MAY 20

440
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,975
It really is past midnight.

441
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,727
What is it? Are you Snow White?

442
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,231
Or was it Cinderella?

443
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,776
It's not your first time coming home late,
so why are you so surprised?

444
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,152
Today is my birthday.

445
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,990
May 20. It sounds like "Oh Yi-young."

446
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,284
I guess some people do

447
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,079
actually name their kids that way.

448
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,207
I mean, happy birthday.

449
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,587
We live in the same house,
but you don't even know my birthday.

450
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,008
I'm sorry. I'm not good
at remembering people's birthdays.

451
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,969
But since it's yours,

452
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,137
I'll buy you anything you want.
Just say the word.

453
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,141
Really?
Yes.

454
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,854
Then, instead of a gift,

455
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,524
can you grant me one wish?

456
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,403
Well, let me hear it first.

457
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,779
Just do it, will you?

458
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,031
Okay, I'll do it.

459
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,743
Until we arrive home…

460
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,080
So, until we reach the 14th floor,

461
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,541
just say okay to everything I say.

462
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,676
What are you doing? Get in.

463
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,272
Can you buy me dinner?
Okay.

464
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,650
Frozen pork belly?

465
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,654
We already planned to eat
with our siblings next weekend.

466
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,655
I'll pay for it then.

467
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,575
Damn it.

468
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,999
Can we watch a movie?

469
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,584
Okay.

470
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,546
I'll have Netflix and beer ready
on Friday night,

471
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,964
so come out to the living room.

472
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,054
Nine.

473
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,473
Ten.

474
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,936
Eleven.

475
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,109
Can I like you?

476
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,149
Okay.

477
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,208
If you want things
to get awkward between us…

478
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,503
then go ahead.

479
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,612
Go a little bit later today.
We have something to do.

480
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,972
Blow it out.

481
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,641
Happy birthday!

482
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,809
Happy birthday.

483
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,438
Isn't it too early for a birthday party?

484
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,356
Who knows what time
you two will come home?

485
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,400
At least have some seaweed soup
on your birthday.

486
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,861
Did you take a picture?
We should send it to your father.

487
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,862
You're right.

488
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,412
Hey, smile.

489
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,206
How pretty!

490
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,710
Time to score some points with Dad.

491
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,005
I'll tell him I prepared
Yi-young's birthday meal in their stead.

492
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,882
You didn't make this. Seung-won did.

493
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,675
Yi-young, how did you know?

494
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,677
Because it tastes good.
It's seasoned perfectly.

495
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,473
Hi, did you see the photo?

496
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,977
He says happy birthday.
Thanks.

497
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,356
She's just like Mom,
so she loves a lot of meat in her soup.

498
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,234
Seung-won did a terrific job.

499
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,321
Are you doing well, sir?
I'm taking good care of your daughters.

500
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,783
Yeah. Is work going well?

501
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:32,038
Mr. Cheol-min isn't your friend anymore.
He's your boss. Learn well from him.

502
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,668
Stop apologizing so much.

503
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,296
Yi-young finally got her act together
thanks to your bankruptcy.

504
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,466
Okay. We'll visit Busan sometime.

505
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,634
Hold on.

506
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,219
Hey. Damn it.

507
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,679
Hey.

508
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,557
Hi.

509
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,851
What?

510
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,519
I see.

511
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,021
Yeah. Okay.

512
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,731
Bye.

513
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,109
Geez.

514
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,528
Thank you for the meal.

515
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,822
Are you done already?
Yeah.

516
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,369
I'm heading out now.

517
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,453
Be safe.

518
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,292
Don't you have any gifts for me?

519
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,710
Right, your gift.

520
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,545
I didn't know what you'd like.

521
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,673
So I just wired you some money.
That's not true.

522
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,008
You know best what I like.

523
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,510
Thank you, Seung-won.

524
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,932
As a married couple,
that's our gift to you.

525
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,772
OB-GYN
1ST-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE

526
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,108
Hey, Yi-young. Happy birthday.

527
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,027
Happy birthday.
The messenger app reminded me.

528
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,778
You should've told us. Happy birthday.

529
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,077
UM JAE-IL
HAS SENT YOU A GIFT

530
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,249
Hey, I didn't have time to buy a gift.
Let's have a proper party next time.

531
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,295
PYO NAM-KYUNG
HAS SENT YOU A GIFT

532
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,296
Happy birthday.

533
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,006
That's the most popular scent.

534
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,799
KIM SA-BI
HAS SENT YOU A GIFT

535
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,217
Happy birthday, Yi-young.

536
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,803
I don't really know yet what you like.

537
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,804
Happy birthday.

538
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,977
They're so in sync at times like this.

539
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,357
Right? It is, isn't it?

540
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,946
Well…

541
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,197
It's a girl, isn't it?

542
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,533
Both my pregnancy dream
and the shape of my belly say it's a girl.

543
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,453
The legs are crossed,
so it's a bit unclear.

544
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,622
But it looks like a boy.

545
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,541
No way. That can't be right.

546
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,501
Are you sure?

547
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,336
Yes.

548
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,213
Doctor.

549
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,007
I'm going through all this at 44

550
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,593
just to have a daughter.

551
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,928
Please check again.

552
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,266
It's definitely a boy.
I'm very good at identifying the gender.

553
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,268
Are you sure you weren't mistaken?

554
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,189
The way it kicks feels
completely different than theirs did.

555
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,654
I'm certain though.

556
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,451
Then, ma'am, let me check
one last time to be sure.

557
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,786
- Okay.
Okay.

558
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,663
Doctor?

559
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,415
Again?

560
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,084
Yes, just to confirm.

561
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:33,886
Ma'am.

562
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,304
It is a boy.

563
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,265
Right? I was right.

564
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,767
Wait. Is it really not a girl?

565
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,937
No. Just as he said, it's really a boy.

566
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,232
Goodness. How will I handle four boys?

567
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,027
What am I going to do?
For crying out loud.

568
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,112
It might be tough raising them,

569
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,365
but having many brothers
could be fun and nice.

570
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,491
I agree.

571
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,786
And being the youngest,
he'll probably be very cute like me.

572
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,912
Forget it!

573
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,958
Well, at least the baby is healthy.

574
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,877
You did very well.

575
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,884
She had such high expectations,
so I wanted to be sure.

576
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,219
Yeah, you're good
at determining genders now.

577
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,472
Yes, I've really got the hang of it now!

578
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,389
I know.

579
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,518
Hey, congratulations.
I hope I won't see you again today.

580
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,644
I'll get going then.

581
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,730
Okay. Thank you!

582
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,318
Mom!

583
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,904
Turn on the Wi-Fi!

584
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,238
Hurry!

585
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,657
They're streaming the game right now!

586
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,204
Based on what we saw in the imaging,
the cancer fortunately hasn't spread much.

587
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,414
The surgery shouldn't take too long.
Hurry!

588
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,708
Right now!
Hold on.

589
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
Once we get
the tissue analysis results after surgery,

590
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,422
we'll tell you what type of cancer it is
and its exact stage.

591
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,467
Hurry!
Just hold still for a minute.

592
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,428
You'll need to walk often to prevent
intestinal adhesions post-surgery.

593
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,847
Mom!
Blood clots can form easily in the legs,

594
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,933
so just wiggling your feet in bed…
Come on!

595
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,226
…would be very helpful.

596
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,394
Fine!

597
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,775
There you go, okay?

598
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,821
Nice.

599
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,614
Doctor.

600
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,492
Of course,
the surgery itself is important.

601
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,704
But I heard some people who undergo
general anesthesia never wake up and die.

602
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,249
My uncle's friend's brother
said he saw it happen.

603
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,792
Well…

604
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,753
We can't say there is
absolutely no possibility of that.

605
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,340
But that's why
we do so many tests before surgery.

606
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,176
And everything checked out fine.
I see.

607
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,763
Maybe it's because
my husband isn't in Korea

608
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,557
so I'm feeling anxious,

609
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,476
but I've been having bad dreams lately.

610
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,020
My mind has been running wild.

611
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,274
I see.
Do your patients all wake up

612
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,733
after their surgeries?

613
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,112
Yes, we usually call out their names
when the surgery is over.

614
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,489
And they all wake up just fine.

615
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,574
Really?

616
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,785
Then please call out my name loudly.

617
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,787
"Na Se-jin!"

618
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,788
Like this.

619
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,252
If I still don't wake up,
please say, "Ko Min-jun."

620
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,462
Okay.
You have to.

621
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,339
You have to say it loudly.

622
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,591
I understand.

623
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,261
Ko Min-jun.

624
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,557
How many times do I need to tell you
that we're not the only ones here?

625
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,892
Turn the sound off.

626
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,602
Hey.

627
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,395
Fine!

628
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,108
I'm sorry for always troubling you.

629
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,694
It's fine. Please don't apologize.

630
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,531
We can't even be sick in peace
since we're moms.

631
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,783
So please don't apologize for such things.

632
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,202
Thank you.

633
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,330
I'm sorry.

634
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,540
He's still young and immature.

635
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,042
We're the same age.

636
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,877
We're both ten.

637
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,795
My goodness, I see.

638
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,424
Gosh, you seemed so mature

639
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,718
that I thought you were older.

640
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,889
Hello.

641
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,433
I've explained everything.
Okay.

642
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,852
I'll make sure surgery goes well.

643
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,146
I'll see you later in the operating room.

644
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,067
Hello, Ms. Ha Jong-im.
How are you feeling?

645
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,443
So-so.

646
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,613
Doctor, am I

647
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,490
getting the chemotherapy?

648
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,532
Well…

649
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,328
Your white blood cell count
hasn't increased yet, so not right away.

650
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,372
Is that so?

651
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,792
Then, she has to stay
in the hospital longer?

652
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,752
For how many days?

653
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,924
First, we'll give you
some immune-boosting injections.

654
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,093
Then we'll do another blood test tomorrow.

655
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,719
Okay.

656
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,013
You had four surgeries in ten years

657
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,516
and multiple rounds of chemo
and radiation therapy,

658
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,351
so it must have taken a toll on your body.

659
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,438
Also, a lot happened
during your last round of treatments,

660
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,274
so it's taking some time
for it to recover.

661
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,693
We almost couldn't do
the chemo then, but we did.

662
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,112
I'm sure it'll go well this time too.

663
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,613
Don't worry.

664
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:08,202
My surgery will go well,
and you'll get chemo too.

665
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,454
Then we'll both
be discharged in good health.

666
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,957
I usually have good feelings
about these things.

667
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,751
I see. Thank you.

668
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,794
All right, then.

669
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,215
Excuse me, Doctor.
Yes?

670
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,050
Is Dr. Ki Eun-mi around by any chance?

671
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,635
She went into surgery.

672
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,554
I see.

673
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,558
I'm sorry,

674
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,394
but could I ask you for a favor?

675
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,359
Of course Dr. Ki would do this.

676
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,531
Why isn't your friend eating?

677
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,701
He still needs his mom to feed him.

678
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,786
As if he's still a kid.

679
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,706
You are kids. You're ten.

680
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,208
Some ten-year-olds are more mature.

681
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,257
Who's that?

682
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,885
My patient's daughter.
Her mom asked me to eat with her.

683
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,219
I see.

684
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,234
Geez, these damn ads.

685
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,778
Just text him first.

686
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,529
What?

687
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,615
Text him first
if you're going to wait like this.

688
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,908
No, I'm not.

689
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,827
I'm not waiting for him.
What are you talking about?

690
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,248
Do you want some water?

691
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,585
Sure.

692
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,261
1ST-YEAR OH YI-YOUNG

693
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,431
You scared me!
I thought it was the delivery room.

694
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,184
Sure, let's say that's what you thought.

695
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,733
LEE
ATTENDING DOCTOR: KIM SA-BI

696
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,287
Excuse me, I'm coming in.

697
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,002
I'm here to get
Ms. Lee Ok-sun's consent for her surgery.

698
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,630
Could you draw the curtain?

699
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,048
Sure.

700
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,096
You're scheduled
for uterine prolapse surgery tomorrow.

701
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,890
Good grief. Why are you so loud?

702
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,517
Mom, please.

703
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,103
Everyone in this room
is going to find out.

704
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,312
About what?

705
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,859
You know, about my uterus.

706
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,069
I told you it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

707
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,988
You don't know what you're talking about.

708
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,658
They pretend like they don't care,
but deep down, they do.

709
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,744
How utterly embarrassing.

710
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,247
Mom, you've already
been admitted for surgery.

711
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,416
We can't cancel it now.

712
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,542
Right, Doctor?

713
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,252
That's not exactly true.

714
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,214
It would be best to do it though.

715
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,926
How much longer am I even going to live?

716
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,929
Why bother with such surgery at my age?

717
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,848
Come on.
They said it's a simple procedure.

718
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,392
Why would you want to live
in discomfort and pain?

719
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,394
She's right. This isn't major surgery.

720
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,063
We'll just pull up the part of the uterus
that has dropped--

721
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,566
Goodness! Can you please be quiet?

722
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,610
I said they can hear everything!

723
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,405
We'll just check
that everything's secure post-surgery,

724
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,948
and you'll be discharged right away.

725
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,242
I'd rather not have it done though.

726
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,288
It's not like I'm dying,
so why are you making such a fuss?

727
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,456
Mom!

728
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,297
LAPAROSCOPIC VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY
CONSENT FORM

729
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,845
About Ms. Lee Ok-sun…

730
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,645
Prolapse. She's…

731
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,231
- She's the patient from Busan.
Yes.

732
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,942
I explained everything
from the procedure to the consent form.

733
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,944
Okay. Good job.

734
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,154
But she doesn't want the surgery.

735
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,072
What?

736
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,740
She didn't sign the consent form.

737
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,326
I think she was forced
by her daughter to come here.

738
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,452
Really? But…

739
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,413
She came all the way to Seoul
and had the tests.

740
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,414
Right.

741
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,583
Her WBC and CRP levels are normal,

742
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,211
but she has vaginal discharge
and a severe foul odor.

743
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,546
Then she needs the surgery.

744
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,965
Why? Why won't she do it?

745
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,008
She's ashamed about the illness

746
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,177
and doesn't want others
to find out about it.

747
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,596
Oh, dear.

748
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,600
There is no such thing
as an embarrassing illness.

749
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,518
Right?

750
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,731
In that case…

751
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:49,900
How about you,

752
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,194
Sa-rang--

753
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,112
It's Sa-bi!

754
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,573
Right.

755
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,950
How about our lovely Sa-bi--

756
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,411
I'll ask if she'd like to sign
a voluntary discharge form.

757
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,412
No.

758
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,001
I think it'd be better
if she had the surgery.

759
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,004
But we can't force her.

760
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,213
Right.

761
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,508
So please ask her one more time.

762
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,426
Sorry?

763
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,346
But I already explained it twice
in really thorough and detailed terms.

764
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,848
I know, but…

765
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,851
In Korea, people believe
in the rule of three.

766
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,438
Rock, paper, scissors.

767
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,356
High, middle, low.

768
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,193
Three Meals a Day.
What?

769
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,780
Gosh, Three Meals a Day.

770
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,658
Just once more.
Let's ask her one more time.

771
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:41,744
Okay.

772
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,538
I'm counting on you.

773
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,166
You can do it.

774
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,633
I can do it.
Yeah. Third time's the charm.

775
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,717
Good.

776
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:58,886
We can do it.

777
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,889
Yeah, the three of us.

778
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,522
Doctor.

779
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,276
Doctor?

780
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,238
Doctor.

781
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,868
Do you know when his mom
will be done with surgery?

782
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,161
What's her name?

783
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,749
What's your mom's name?

784
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,335
Na Se-jin.

785
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,629
It's Na Se-jin.

786
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,256
Ms. Na Se-jin.

787
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,424
Just a minute.

788
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,854
Ms. Na, you're all done with surgery.

789
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,776
Let's take her to the recovery room.
Okay.

790
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,319
Submit her specimen on your way back

791
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,988
and prescribe the medications
used during surgery.

792
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,365
Yes, Doctor.

793
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,410
Ms. Na.

794
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,414
Ms. Na.

795
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,459
Ma'am, don't you move! You'll fall!

796
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,711
Ma'am, please don't move!
No!

797
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,712
Ma'am!

798
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,506
Ma'am, this is the operating room.

799
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,384
Yes, you're awake. You're alive.

800
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,011
This isn't the afterlife.
You're still in the real world.

801
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,179
You're alive!

802
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,036
I'm sorry. She's okay now.

803
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,622
It's okay. This is nothing new.

804
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,418
I was wondering why it was so quiet today.

805
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,088
You're Oh Yi-young after all, right?

806
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,090
Gosh, Oh Yi-young.

807
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,727
Yi-young! Can you do me a favor?
No.

808
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,021
Can you just deliver this for me?
Do it yourself.

809
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,273
I need to go to the ER.
My transferred patient is here.

810
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,526
Just ask them to pick it up at the ER.
Just leave this in Dr. Ku's office!

811
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:25,240
She always pretends to be cold,
but still helps in the end.

812
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,201
Right!

813
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:34,208
OB-GYN
4TH-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE

814
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,584
Doctor, it's Oh Yi-young.

815
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,753
I brought the medical certificate.

816
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,153
Do-won, did you check on Ms. Park Seol-a?

817
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,070
Yes, ma'am.

818
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,492
She said her blood pressure
was 140 over 90 at home.

819
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,246
So we retook it,
and it came out normal at 118 over 78.

820
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,957
I didn't suspect preeclampsia,
so I sent her home.

821
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,958
Well done.

822
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,377
Why hasn't Eun-mi updated me
on Ms. So A-jeong?

823
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,672
One moment, please.

824
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,382
We're using oxytocin.

825
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,718
On the last pelvic exam,
the cervix was fingertip soft.

826
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,803
Contractions are steady
at three-minute intervals.

827
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,474
I'll tell Dr. Ki to notify you right away.

828
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,391
I'm sorry.

829
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,476
And what is Da-hye up to?

830
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,520
None of the discharged patients
in the ward had their stitches removed.

831
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,939
I'll check on it. I'm sorry.

832
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,777
Professor Seo's patients
are taken care of. Why are mine not?

833
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,612
What's wrong with you all?

834
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,365
During morning rounds, Dr. Seo personally

835
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,283
did them herself.

836
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:15,786
She did?

837
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,871
Geez.

838
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:18,955
How diligent of her.

839
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,750
Anyway, go check the ward.
It's a total mess.

840
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,293
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

841
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,129
Right. My surgery at 4:00 p.m.

842
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,173
I want you to be there.

843
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,467
Don't only assist Jung-min.

844
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,428
I want to operate with the chief too,
not just the first-years.

845
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,972
I'll be there, Professor.

846
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,140
That's a promise.

847
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,899
Gosh, does she think
you have nothing better to do?

848
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,111
Aren't you here to ask me for a favor too?

849
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,988
Me? No, I came here to compliment you.

850
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,907
I saw the documents
you sent for the paper.

851
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,660
Research on mothers
who received progesterone treatment.

852
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,577
I like that.

853
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,579
Thank you.

854
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,707
So I was thinking…

855
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,377
You might as well compile the results too
since you have all the data.

856
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,046
Would the workload be too much then?

857
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,384
No, I'll do that too.

858
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,637
Okay. I think that'd be more efficient.

859
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,097
Right.

860
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,478
I need to go to the ward.
Okay. Go ahead.

861
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:26,940
Yes?

862
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,567
Okay.

863
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,652
I'll check and let you know.

864
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,160
It's okay.

865
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,830
Your cervical length
is maintaining well at 2 cm.

866
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:42,998
Really?

867
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,791
Thank goodness.

868
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,502
My stomach hurt about an hour ago.

869
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,421
Oh, dear. Is that so?

870
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,340
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

871
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,427
Does this mean I can return to the ward?

872
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,344
Yes.

873
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,521
By the way, did your stomach hurt a lot?

874
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,485
It hurt about once or twice
during that hour.

875
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,195
And

876
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,614
it felt like my insides were sinking.

877
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,786
I examined you thoroughly,
so I think you should be fine to go.

878
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,165
But maybe we should check one last time.

879
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,877
Why? Is something wrong? Is it bad?

880
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,338
No. It's nothing like that.

881
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,966
But it's just to check.

882
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,968
It's better to be safe than sorry.

883
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,518
I'll call her this time.

884
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,687
Okay. Sure, go ahead.

885
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,821
Ma'am, your cervical length is 2 cm.

886
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,155
Right? It's 2 cm?

887
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,199
That's what I got too.

888
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,826
Does that mean I'm okay?

889
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,828
Gosh, I was worried for nothing.

890
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,621
At this stage of pregnancy,

891
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:08,959
you can sometimes experience
false contractions that come and go.

892
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,628
Don't worry too much and try to relax.

893
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,463
Okay, thank you.

894
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,506
Thank you, Doctor.

895
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,007
You're welcome.

896
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,510
Ma'am, you did very well.

897
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:19,970
Thank you.

898
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,809
I'm going to nap for just three minutes.

899
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:26,726
Okay.

900
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,896
By the way, just like I learned,
I didn't insert the probe too deeply

901
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,858
and applied less pressure.
And that gave the exact cervical length.

902
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,735
Yes, you were accurate.

903
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,988
Yes, I was.

904
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,031
Right, the consent form.

905
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,075
I didn't get the consent form. Damn it!

906
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,702
Have a good day!

907
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,290
It's a real relief.

908
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,793
There were no visible signs of spread,
and the surgery went well.

909
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,378
Really?

910
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:56,131
That's such good news.
You must be relieved.

911
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,927
Of course, we'll have to look
at the biopsy results to know for sure.

912
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,638
But based on the ovarian mass as of now,

913
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:07,726
I think it might be related
to clear cell carcinoma.

914
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:08,977
But this type of cancer

915
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,647
is particularly prone
to developing embolisms.

916
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,524
What's an embolism?

917
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,152
It's when a blood clot blocks
a blood vessel.

918
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,446
If it blocks a vessel
to the lungs or heart,

919
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,739
it can be extremely dangerous.

920
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,283
Embolisms are really dangerous.

921
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,412
A lot of people who were on chemo like me
died because of that.

922
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,289
It happens out of nowhere.

923
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,041
Is that so?

924
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,501
For now, make sure to exercise well.

925
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,088
Let me know right away if you experience
any difficulty breathing.

926
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,381
Okay.
Okay.

927
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,051
And, Ms. Ha.

928
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,095
Your immune levels
have improved significantly.

929
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,680
We can proceed with chemo.

930
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,599
Goodness. Am I getting chemo then?

931
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,225
Really, Doctor?

932
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,143
Yes.

933
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,145
I'm so happy for you.

934
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,231
I felt bad that
I was the only one who got surgery.

935
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,567
I was worried
I wouldn't be able to get chemo,

936
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,444
so I tossed and turned all night.

937
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,280
We'll schedule it
after monitoring you tomorrow.

938
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,449
For now, think of this as time to recharge

939
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,909
and get plenty of rest.

940
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,786
Thank you, Professor.

941
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,329
My pleasure. Good day, then.

942
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,802
Goodness. Who is this?

943
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,136
Look who it is.

944
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,098
Are you awake, my son?

945
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,736
I booked a consultation room.

946
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,571
It's empty right now.

947
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,407
Would you like to
speak in private with me?

948
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,578
Gosh, that's okay.
She'll have the surgery, so don't worry.

949
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,579
Right, Mom?

950
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,289
We agreed you would.

951
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,001
You'll feel so much better
after the surgery.

952
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,169
The recurrence rate is low on average,

953
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,297
and according to research papers,
satisfaction rate is very high.

954
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,382
Would you like to see?

955
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,552
No, that's fine.
It's not like I'd understand.

956
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,222
If you don't sign now,
today's surgery will be canceled.

957
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,600
Let me ask one final time.

958
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,436
Are you really not going to do it?

959
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,773
My kids are barely making ends meet,

960
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,317
and I'm already a burden to them.

961
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,778
Mom, we can afford this much.

962
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,822
Don't use us as your excuse.

963
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,824
Well, you see…

964
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,118
Goodness.

965
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:35,290
Other old folks
don't get these issues and live just fine.

966
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,542
I've lived a clean life,

967
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,170
taken good care of myself,

968
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,006
and lived modestly.

969
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,342
As I've mentioned,
those things aren't related to this.

970
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,305
The old ladies in my neighborhood
will beg to differ.

971
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,850
Of course, they're all related.

972
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,980
They have it all wrong.

973
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,358
You shouldn't be friends with them.

974
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,526
Ma'am.

975
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,698
Do you know why you got this illness?

976
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,370
Because you worked so hard in life.

977
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,754
This is all because
you worked too hard in life.

978
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,925
For the past 40 years,

979
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,970
you've been tensing
your abdomen all day long

980
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,306
while skinning eels
to pay for your son's wedding.

981
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,226
And at night,

982
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,187
you crouched in the kitchen
and washed dishes

983
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,189
to pay for your daughter's wedding.

984
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,443
That's why you're sick.

985
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,701
Any parent would do as much.

986
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,411
Exactly.

987
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,039
So get the surgery now,
go back to your neighborhood,

988
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,457
and brag about it to everyone.

989
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,584
Tell them you got it
because you worked hard in life

990
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,963
and that they should live
just as diligently.

991
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,714
Goodness.

992
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,176
I wouldn't have much
to brag about to do that.

993
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,808
We'll make sure to be well-prepared.

994
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,977
Okay. Thank you.

995
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,080
Gosh, my neck.

996
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,124
About Ms. Lee Ok-sun…

997
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,128
I think she changed her mind
because of you.

998
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,296
Really?

999
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,840
Because of your story about the eels

1000
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,383
and dishwashing.

1001
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,971
When I heard it earlier,
I thought you were being too personal.

1002
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,181
What?

1003
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,601
But now that I think about it,
I think it was therapeutic.

1004
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,312
Are you saying I did well?

1005
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,564
Yes, sir.
I'll monitor her progress carefully.

1006
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,732
Good.

1007
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,110
I'm getting coffee. Do you…
No. Your shift's done, right?

1008
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,739
No, I heard there's an emergency cerclage,
so I'm going to observe it.

1009
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,866
- Right, Jung-min's surgery?
Yes.

1010
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:18,620
I've never actually seen it in person.
But you're not going home yet?

1011
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,704
Me?

1012
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,582
I also have
a favorite type of surgery to do.

1013
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,877
Myomectomy.

1014
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,964
There are only five fibroids this time.

1015
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,841
The surgeries in Room 10
are running behind,

1016
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,718
so I'm starting in 30 minutes.

1017
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,053
I see.

1018
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,680
Wait. There's probably
no one available to help right now.

1019
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,433
Yeah, so I had to beg a fellow.

1020
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,392
It'll be us two.

1021
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,561
Just the two of you?
Yeah.

1022
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,147
But there's also the laparoscope, so…

1023
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,150
I guess three?

1024
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,405
Then…

1025
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,449
Maybe I could…

1026
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,161
It's okay.

1027
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,123
But still…
Don't worry about it. You don't have to.

1028
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,125
I can observe next time.

1029
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,043
Really?

1030
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,380
But really, you don't need to help.

1031
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,425
I mean, I feel bad.

1032
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:21,724
Then…

1033
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,892
In that case--

1034
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,435
I'll get going then. Good night.

1035
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,314
I see. You're leaving.

1036
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,524
Okay, goodbye.

1037
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:34,112
I'm sorry, Professor.
It's unlike them to miss things.

1038
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,031
But we had a lot to do in the ward
and delivery room today.

1039
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,452
No, I'll scold them properly today.

1040
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,417
Okay. I'm sorry.

1041
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,508
Knock, knock. Dr. Ku.

1042
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,344
I was just craving some coffee.

1043
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,139
I knew you would,
so I got you the largest size.

1044
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,473
Wait.

1045
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,061
You want me to check another ultrasound?
No. I'm good at that now.

1046
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,481
That's the best news I've heard all day.

1047
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,027
Sex, cervical length,
biometry, and amniotic fluid volume.

1048
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,445
I'm good at judging all of them.

1049
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:19,407
I'm probably the best at ultrasounds
among all the first-years.

1050
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,118
Aren't they all capable of that?

1051
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,162
Come on.

1052
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,497
That's not true. I really did well today.

1053
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,082
All right.

1054
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,083
I'm serious.

1055
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,795
Dr. Ki and Dr. Cha witnessed it too.
And they complimented me.

1056
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,674
Eun-mi and Da-hye did?
Yes.

1057
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,803
After I finished examining,
they came a few times to double-check.

1058
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,930
Every time they came to check
yesterday and today,

1059
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,641
I had everything right.

1060
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,059
I got straight As today.

1061
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:51,230
I'm so good that I think
I'm doing better than Nam-kyung.

1062
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:58,112
It's good that your diagnosis was correct,
but that's not the important thing.

1063
01:00:59,072 --> 01:00:59,989
Sorry?

1064
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,741
You weren't confident in your judgment,

1065
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,619
so didn't you just ask
your seniors to cover for you?

1066
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,998
Eun-mi and Da-hye
are already busy as it is.

1067
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,085
But since you kept calling them
for ultrasounds,

1068
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,878
they must've been insanely busy and tired.

1069
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,298
That's being a nuisance.

1070
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,219
You may think you were right or did well,
but no one thinks that.

1071
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,429
You did what everyone can do.
What's great about that?

1072
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,015
Wasting others' time

1073
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,477
and getting them involved
because you won't take responsibility…

1074
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,479
That's incompetence.

1075
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,401
Think carefully
about what's right in the future.

1076
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,330
"If the placenta previa is severe

1077
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,332
or there's a large myoma
in front of the uterus,

1078
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,293
you should make
a J-shaped uterine incision around…"

1079
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,545
Yi-young, are you dead?

1080
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,589
Are you in a state of mental stupor?

1081
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,759
The professor told me to teach you two.

1082
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,846
Hey, you haven't seen this surgery either.
Are you listening?

1083
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,348
Are you two not going to study?

1084
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,308
They said we're going to
study this next week.

1085
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,686
Why worry about next week already?

1086
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,438
Just worry about tomorrow.

1087
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,022
What's that?
Cookies.

1088
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,736
A patient gave them to me as a thank you.

1089
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,405
Hey, you two. Come have some cookies.

1090
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,742
Hey, bread lover. You don't like cookies?

1091
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,471
Your boyfriend's taking a while this time.

1092
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,472
What do you mean?

1093
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,766
He hasn't contacted you
for a while this time.

1094
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,517
I'm not waiting for his call.

1095
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,644
I'm waiting for the delivery room to call.

1096
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,937
Geez.
Fine.

1097
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,648
Hey, is there only one box of cookies?

1098
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,358
Buy some with your own money.

1099
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,195
I don't have any money.

1100
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,910
The poorer I am, the hungrier I get.
How sad.

1101
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,625
But it's a peaceful night
for once, isn't it?

1102
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,673
I wish every day
could be this quiet and uneventful.

1103
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,973
OB-GYN, code blue.

1104
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:34,560
Ward 101, Room 1018. OB-GYN, code blue.

1105
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,357
OB-GYN, code blue.

1106
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,944
Ward 101, Room 1018. OB-GYN, code blue.

1107
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,988
Connect the line, please.
Epinephrine.

1108
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,031
Portable X-ray too.

1109
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,699
Run an ABGA.

1110
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,791
RESTRICTED ACCESS

1111
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,595
Her vitals were stable this afternoon.

1112
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,764
Then suddenly an hour ago,

1113
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,392
she complained of dyspnea and chest pain.

1114
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:17,061
Then her BP dropped, and her RR increased.

1115
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,440
Her vitals couldn't be stabilized,
so we performed CPR for 30 minutes.

1116
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,734
After her vitals returned,
we intubated her.

1117
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,862
But her BP wouldn't rise
even with vasopressors,

1118
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,281
so we transferred her to the ICU.

1119
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,369
Why all of a sudden?

1120
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,372
Based on the chest CT scan,

1121
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,791
it appears to be pulmonary embolism.

1122
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,253
Where's her family?

1123
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,881
She's waiting outside.

1124
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,800
Let's bring her here.
Yes, sir.

1125
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,766
Your mom

1126
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:57,894
is having

1127
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,646
some difficulty breathing right now.

1128
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,648
My mom's not dead.

1129
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,570
She has always been sick.

1130
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:10,489
I heard she's been sick since I was born.

1131
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,828
This is exactly like the last time.

1132
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,957
She was discharged then too.

1133
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,631
But the thing is, this time…

1134
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,632
Well…

1135
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,940
Is anyone coming for her?

1136
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,274
Yes, sir.

1137
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,360
There's a foundation
that sponsors the patient,

1138
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,362
and someone from there will be coming.

1139
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:53,741
It seems she's made
a lot of preparations in advance.

1140
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:55,910
I see.

1141
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:03,793
Then, until they arrive,
I want you to stay with the kid, Dr. Oh.

1142
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,463
Me?
Yes.

1143
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,092
Buy her something kids like,
such as ice cream.

1144
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,720
And

1145
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,847
explain things to her a bit.

1146
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,349
She's ten, so,

1147
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,936
she'll understand most things.

1148
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,438
Yes, sir.

1149
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:25,856
All right, then.

1150
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,224
I think your mom will go to heaven.

1151
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,434
No, she won't.

1152
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,812
You just don't know,

1153
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:10,276
but my mom always gets
really sick like this and gets discharged.

1154
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,321
It's for real this time.

1155
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:15,906
This time,

1156
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,201
she'll go to heaven.

1157
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,454
You don't have much time.

1158
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,332
So you need
to take a good look at her face.

1159
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,210
Is my mom really…

1160
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,048
going to die?

1161
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:39,805
Yeah.

1162
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,405
Then…

1163
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,161
what about me?

1164
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,542
I'm still

1165
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,961
just a kid.

1166
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:15,382
She's already found people
and places that will help you.

1167
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,010
They'll be here soon.

1168
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:35,152
Tomorrow at dawn or in the morning,
you might have to…

1169
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,492
say your final goodbyes.

1170
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,121
Don't say you won't do it
because you're scared.

1171
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,706
Tell her everything you want to say.

1172
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,419
And

1173
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,382
you'll have photos
to remember her face for a long time.

1174
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,387
But you'll forget
what she smelled like really fast.

1175
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:06,725
So make sure
you keep her clothes for a long time.

1176
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,312
Okay?

1177
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,746
There will be a funeral for three days
after she passes away.

1178
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,040
The person who's coming today
will help with that too.

1179
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,542
Just know that.

1180
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:33,752
Okay.

1181
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,342
"Don't cry from now on."

1182
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,012
"Be brave and good."

1183
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,223
"Eat well and study hard."

1184
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,438
That's what

1185
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,942
the people who attend
the funeral will say.

1186
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,201
Because they said the same to me.

1187
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,545
I was in middle school.

1188
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,798
That's when my mom
became an angel in heaven.

1189
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,893
But it's difficult to do.

1190
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,236
I wanted to be good and brave too.

1191
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,907
But I'd cry at random times.

1192
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,910
And I'd get so angry.

1193
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:51,747
I'd be so irritated
that I wouldn't want to eat.

1194
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,337
But that wasn't because I was a bad kid.

1195
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:06,720
When your mom dies,

1196
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,891
it leaves a hole this big in your heart.

1197
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,480
I still have mine. It's enormous.

1198
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,610
That's why,

1199
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,154
so don't hide and cry.

1200
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,449
Don't pretend to smile when you're sad.

1201
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,162
Just do whatever you feel like doing.

1202
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:35,332
Okay?

1203
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:51,390
Here's my phone number.

1204
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,603
If you ever have a hard time
or have any questions, call me.

1205
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,772
You can call me every day.

1206
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,525
Okay.

1207
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,288
Hye-min?

1208
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,295
Who are you?

1209
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:24,882
I'm from the foundation
that supported her mother.

1210
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,634
Hye-min and I have met often.

1211
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:30,679
I see.

1212
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,432
I heard her condition suddenly worsened.

1213
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,685
Yes, she was scheduled
for chemotherapy tomorrow.

1214
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,938
But she suddenly developed
multiple pulmonary embolisms.

1215
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,532
Then, what's going to happen to Hye-min?

1216
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,329
A relative her mother
mentioned before is on the way.

1217
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,416
And we'll continue to provide care too.

1218
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:01,877
I see.

1219
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:03,337
Thank you.

1220
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:11,011
I should get going then.

1221
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:11,929
Okay.

1222
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,482
Shall we sit down?

1223
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,117
You must be so scared.

1224
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,369
Are you feeling sick at all?

1225
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,668
You have a slight fever.

1226
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,461
Does your head hurt?

1227
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:48,298
I brought some medicine just in case.

1228
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:55,180
Should we get something to eat?

1229
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,644
Do you miss your mom?

1230
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,861
Let's go see her.

1231
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,588
Mom!

1232
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,050
Mom…

1233
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,764
Mom…

1234
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,778
Yi-young! Joo-young! Get up already!

1235
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,823
That shop was terrible.

1236
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,826
I bought cabbage from there last year,
and it ruined our kimchi.

1237
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,162
Really? You know a better place?

1238
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:03,040
Hey! Wash up and get ready to leave!

1239
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:05,042
Get up! Your food's getting cold!

1240
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,168
Seriously…

1241
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,671
Right, didn't you say
your second child was getting married?

1242
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,590
How old is she this year?

1243
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:14,927
That's right.
She's the same age as Yi-young.

1244
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:19,306
Gosh, when did our kids grow up so fast?

1245
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,726
I'm getting teary-eyed.

1246
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,516
Damn it.

1247
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,073
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST,
YOO YEON-SEOK, OUR ETERNAL AHN JEONG-WON

1248
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:44,826
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1249
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,371
I have the worst luck with colleagues.

1250
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,414
We're completely incompatible.

1251
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,834
Trying to talk to understand them
just makes things worse.

1252
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:53,877
You're so frustrating.

1253
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,671
I feel the same. You frustrate me too.

1254
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:56,755
I'm doing it right now.

1255
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:57,839
- Do it.
Okay!

1256
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,633
They're always fighting these days.

1257
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,051
They just don't get along.

1258
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:02,761
Hey, first-years.

1259
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,970
I'm sorry, sir.

1260
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,723
- I thought you did it.
I thought you would do it.

1261
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,642
"I read this in a textbook, so I know."

1262
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:10,477
I have no idea what to do.

1263
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,229
This is all your fault.

1264
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:15,023
Congratulations, Dr. Myeong.

1265
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,150
You were listed as a presenter
for the conference.

1266
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,902
Aren't you angry? Aren't you pissed?

1267
01:18:18,985 --> 01:18:20,779
It really was my mistake.

1268
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,072
A mistake?

1269
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:24,866
Dr. Ku, I know you worked hard on this…

1270
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,159
Want to drink some soju?

1271
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,828
It's time to go home.

1272
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,705
You didn't go home again?

1273
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,289
Every night these days,

1274
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,250
you might not believe it, but…

1275
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,751
You look really tired.

1276
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:36,670
If it's okay with you,

1277
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,588
would you like me to take a look?

1278
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,096
