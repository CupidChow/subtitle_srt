EPISODE 11

3
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,025
Damn, why is it taking so long?

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,529
Our reservation's at 5:00 p.m.
We still have an hour.

5
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,490
Why do you suddenly have to
look at houses now?

6
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,744
I was planning to move near the hospital
before starting my fellowship.

7
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,995
I mean,

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,706
we're so busy
we barely see each other at home.

9
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,124
We always see each other at work.

10
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,298
Do you like me that much?

11
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,218
Yes. So what?

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,972
I like you a lot too.

13
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,935
Did you just say that?

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,938
Ever since we started dating,

15
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,400
did you know we've been
really awkward and uncomfortable at home?

16
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,403
That's not true.
It's been really comfortable and nice.

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,907
You don't wear
your old, worn-out shirt anymore,

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,742
and you don't lie around on the sofa now.

19
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,328
You come out and wash after I go to bed.

20
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,125
Regardless of our siblings,
it's right that I move out.

21
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,004
And if I find a house,

22
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,758
we get a place to be alone together.

23
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,427
Alone?

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,595
Just the two of us?

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,181
To do what?

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,520
That's not what I meant.

27
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,189
Let's sign the contract today
and move in next week.

28
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,858
Geez, where is the real estate agent?

29
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,402
We've been waiting for hours.

30
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,489
I didn't mean to overhear.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,908
Hello.

32
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,118
Hello.

33
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,036
I'm also a client.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,288
He's out showing a house.

35
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,248
He won't be long.

36
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,333
I see. Thank you.

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,295
What were you looking for?

38
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,384
Well, a small apartment
on jeonse or wolse lease.

39
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,053
Around 700 square feet or so?

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,513
-Yes.
-I see.

41
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,017
In which neighborhood?

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,981
Pyeongbuk-dong…

43
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,023
Pyeongbuk-dong?

44
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,984
Where Jongno Yulje is?

45
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,443
Yes.

46
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,239
That neighborhood's really nice.

47
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,284
It has a lot of places
to visit nearby too,

48
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,202
so there's no better place for newlyweds.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,580
We're not newlyweds.

50
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,123
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,835
You two just look so good together,

52
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,794
so I just assumed.

53
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,090
I know that neighborhood well.

54
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,968
There's a place called
the Melodium Apartments there.

55
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,554
It's a good location,
and the landscaping's well done too.

56
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,347
Also, it's an "AWE."

57
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,724
An AWE?

58
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,684
"Apartment with an elementary school."

59
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,477
It's a great place for raising children.

60
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,021
Children?

61
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,982
Never mind the AWE.

62
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,693
And the land must have good energy too.

63
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,570
Everyone ends up better off
after moving in.

64
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,114
Especially, Building 215.

65
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,116
The units face south,
so they get a lot of sun.

66
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,118
And their structure
makes them well-ventilated.

67
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,955
And it's on a great floor.

68
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,167
The 12th floor is in the middle.
There's no noise between floors.

69
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,419
And the neighbors are so nice.

70
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,462
Plus,

71
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,881
it's cheaper than what's nearby.

72
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,181
About this much.

73
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,561
But if it's that good, why is it cheap?

74
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,522
The owner of the unit is nice, and…

75
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,066
They're in a hurry.

76
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,402
How about it? Want to go now?
You can see it right away.

77
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,446
Are you?

78
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,949
Yes, I'm the owner. It's my house.

79
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:02,825
I knew it.

80
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,578
I watch the news too, okay?

81
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm not that kind of person!

82
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,710
I know we just met,
so I'm sorry to say this,

83
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,587
but I was a victim.

84
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,590
Yes, a victim of jeonse fraud.

85
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,842
I suffered so much
because of that back then.

86
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,220
Seriously, my wife was so--

87
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,346
I assume she was very ill.

88
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,598
So, she had to go to the hospital
and have surgery.

89
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,308
How did you know?

90
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,852
It's the same story used
by the scammers I saw on the news.

91
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,857
After I was scammed,

92
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,318
I was so scared of jeonse leases

93
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,195
I took out a loan
to pay for all of my house.

94
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,197
I'll show you the title deed myself.

95
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
I have no debts attached to it.

96
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,492
I'll show you my ID,

97
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,078
and I'm going to get
jeonse guarantee insurance.

98
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,497
Wait a second. Wait!

99
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,957
I'm really not a scammer.

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,500
My home really is that nice, so--

101
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,127
Please stop. Or I'll bite.

102
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:55,962
No!

103
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,423
She really will.

104
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,550
We have things to do, so…

105
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,428
Let's at least clear things up
before you go!

106
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,345
Seriously?

107
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,431
Calm down.

108
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,349
All right.

109
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,564
How in the world do I seem like a scammer?

110
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,107
I look like a saint.

111
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,194
Sir.

112
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey. It was a long wait, wasn't it?
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,491
No one's coming to see my house.

114
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,285
I really have to move.

115
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,203
Gosh, it's not something I can control.

116
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,415
It's already been three months
since I put it on the market.

117
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,418
We have to move
before my second child is born.

118
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,045
All right. Just wait.

119
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,631
Come on. Please, sir.

120
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,175
What's wrong with you?

121
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,858
We almost got scammed earlier.

122
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,986
I'm eating out of shock.

123
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,239
Right. You have to eat a lot
after being shocked.

124
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,574
You have to calm yourself down.

125
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,243
Eat up.

126
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,287
Okay.

127
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,044
What's this?

128
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,421
What did you get on your hand?

129
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,134
Gosh, your hands are so messy. Geez.

130
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,761
There. It's all clean.

131
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
My ring finger's a size ten.

132
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,857
My fingers are thinner than you think.

133
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,111
So stop that and just eat. Now.

134
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,907
I have no idea what you're talking about.

135
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,660
You had something on your finger,
so I really wiped it for you.

136
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,120
Was that for buying couple rings?

137
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,037
As a surprise?

138
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,331
What? No!

139
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,874
Why measure my finger suddenly then?

140
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,792
And why secretly?

141
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,086
Can't you just pretend not to know?

142
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,716
I have something for you.

143
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,763
Ta-da.

144
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,681
What is this?

145
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,728
These are nice!

146
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,772
How did you know my size?

147
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,066
I just knew without having to measure.

148
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,984
But how?

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,736
We use the same shoe cabinet.

150
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,822
Right.

151
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,615
Try them on.

152
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,797
What's this?

153
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,342
-Dad!
-Honey!

154
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,387
-What's wrong?
-Dad!

155
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,431
Someone help!

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,641
Honey!

157
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,394
What's wrong?
Is something caught in your throat?

158
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,312
-The meat.
-Meat.

159
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,022
He was eating meat and suddenly…

160
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
-Dad!
-Call an ambulance! Hurry!

161
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,069
Grab onto him.

162
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,407
Sir, can you hear me?

163
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,325
Sir!

164
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,747
-Maintain his airway.
-Okay.

165
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,589
An ambulance is on the way.

166
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,761
-A spoon, please.
-Spoon…

167
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,525
Wait.

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,863
We have ROSC.

169
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,867
Sir, can you hear me?

170
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,834
The ambulance will arrive soon
to take you to the hospital.

171
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,462
You'll be all right. Don't worry.

172
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,713
It's here!

173
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,590
Over here!

174
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,342
Honey. Are you okay?

175
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,303
Thank you.

176
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,429
This way! Here!

177
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,433
Thank goodness.

178
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,727
He's okay! What a relief!

179
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,854
Thank goodness it came quickly.

JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

182
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,707
I told you to get another hour of sleep.

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,042
We have no time to meet this week.

184
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,669
So we have to go to work together.

185
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,172
Do you have time for coffee?

186
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,426
At around 6:15 a.m.

187
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,266
You washed your face, right?

188
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,810
I couldn't. I can do it here.

189
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,024
You're so cute.

190
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,860
Excuse me.

191
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,449
Yes?

192
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,994
May I ask which floor
outpatient care is on?

193
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,412
Oh, it's…

194
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,249
It's on the second floor.

195
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,251
You can take the elevator there.

196
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,462
Okay, thank you.

197
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm Lee Chae-ryeong. I'm the new nurse
assigned to the delivery room.

198
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,569
It's nice to meet you.

199
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,697
It's nice to meet you too.

200
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,493
If you have any questions,
you can ask our first-year residents.

201
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,119
Yes, you can ask us anything.

202
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,914
Like the hospital layout
or people's names,

203
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,290
I'll tell you all I know.

204
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,249
Thank you.

205
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,169
I did come early to have a look around,

206
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,545
but I think I'll get lost a lot.

207
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,673
How early did you come in for work?

208
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,883
Gosh, you're so diligent.

209
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,677
I'll be even more diligent and work hard.

210
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,929
Thank you for welcoming me.

211
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,390
Let's grab a bite soon.

212
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,891
-Sure.
-See you later.

213
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,811
-It's nice to meet you.
-Let's get lunch later.

214
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,956
It's nice to see you again, Doctor.

215
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,625
Yes, me too.

216
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,378
Don't worry about earlier.

217
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,838
It's a secret, right?

218
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,132
Yes, for now.

219
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,092
Right.

220
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,473
I was so shocked earlier
and couldn't tell you, but--

221
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,891
I heard the new nurse is here?

222
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,442
Hello, I'm Lee Chae-ryeong.

223
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,568
It's nice to meet you.

224
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,404
Hello.

225
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,739
It's nice to meet you.

226
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,120
I got some coffee.

227
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,413
Thank you.

228
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,336
I should…

229
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,213
Have a nice day.

230
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,388
Hello, Doctor.

231
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,268
What is it? Where are you going?

232
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,895
I heard the new nurse was here.

233
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,855
She's at the station. Go say hi.

234
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,065
Okay. But where are you going?

235
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,983
Outpatient care.

236
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,820
Outpatient care?

237
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,697
Alone?

238
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,949
Yeah. Who would I go with?

239
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,075
I know, right?

240
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,078
I mean, it just seems like

241
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,706
you've been going there
day and night these days.

242
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,125
I was wondering
if something nice was going on there.

243
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,376
What are you talking about?

244
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,255
Doctor, don't worry.

245
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,548
I may not seem like it,

246
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,759
but I'm very loyal.

247
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,184
What's with him?

248
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,984
Does he…

249
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,238
Did you hear about Prof. Seo?

250
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,449
The intern she put her time into
refused to shake her hand.

251
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,117
She must've been rejected.

252
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,410
Tak Gi-on?

253
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,328
Yeah.

254
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,540
The okay ones seem to have
already chosen their departments.

255
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,333
Dong-eun's long gone too.

256
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,503
So Gi-on's the only one we can hope for.

257
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,422
I don't think he's interested in OB-GYN.

258
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,759
And I'm not sure
if he's even that good at the job.

259
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,012
But he is.
Prof. Geum told us at the team dinner.

260
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,099
The intern on rotation for two months
was better than the first-years…

261
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,938
is something that can't be true.

262
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,648
But…

263
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,443
Maybe she said it was nice?

264
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,653
What did she say?

265
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,573
Right.

266
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,492
But, Doctor,

267
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,829
what if no one joins OB-GYN next year?

268
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,622
What do you think?

269
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,082
We'll be screwed.

270
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,792
Remember Pediatrics?

271
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,335
That could be us.

272
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,546
Our workload would double,

273
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,756
and our days without sleep
would quadruple.

274
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,218
Basically, your second year
would be doomed.

275
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,970
Wait, do you mean

276
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,514
if we have no first-years,
we'd have to do all the work?

277
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,557
That's right.

278
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,143
That's ridiculous. That's not fair.

279
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,604
So, I wanted to tell you

280
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,565
we should bring Tak Gi-on to our team.

281
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,358
Let's try to persuade him, okay?

282
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,239
INTERN TAK GI-ON

283
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:09,992
Okay.

284
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,244
I'll try to persuade him.

285
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,792
Hello? Hi, Dr. Tak.

286
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,253
-How does it feel here?
-It's okay.

287
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,923
-And here?
-That's a bit--

288
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,299
Excuse me.

289
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,969
Is the patient with menstrual cramps here?

290
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,887
Yes.

291
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,305
Hello.

292
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,641
Are you in a lot of pain, ma'am?

293
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,642
Yes.

294
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,728
She's been on painkillers
since yesterday afternoon,

295
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,229
but she says the pain has worsened.

296
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,566
She's experiencing cramps,

297
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,401
but it's not like the feeling of diarrhea.

298
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,071
An unlike gastrospasms,
there's no pain in the upper abdomen.

299
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,532
Also, it feels
as if her lower abdomen will give out,

300
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,451
but she says it's not like a contusion.

301
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,786
I see.

302
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,666
Ma'am, is it an irritating ache
in the lower belly,

303
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,418
like your organs
are being squeezed, right?

304
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,962
Yes, that's right.

305
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,547
A heavy, twisting pain in the lower belly

306
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,300
that spreads out
making it hard to even sit?

307
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,551
Yes.

308
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,387
I'm in so much pain

309
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,555
that I can't do anything right now.

310
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,933
I have severe menstrual pain too,
so I know.

311
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,727
Have you been bleeding more than usual?

312
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,941
It was particularly heavy this time,
so it got on my clothes…

313
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,032
I had to use
an overnight pad the first day.

314
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,954
It could be due to endometriosis
or adenomyosis,

315
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,998
so we'll do an ultrasound.

316
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,957
Okay.

317
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,925
They're just menstrual cramps,
so I prescribed painkillers.

318
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,761
She can be discharged after resting a bit.

319
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,305
Okay. Thank you.

320
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,476
Even female doctors
who don't experience bad menstrual pain

321
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,894
don't really get how it hurts.

322
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,481
Some wonder why people
even come to the hospital,

323
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,316
because theirs are never that bad.

324
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,738
But some male doctors say you can tell
without having to experience it.

325
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,283
They figure it must really hurt if people
come to the ER early in the morning.

326
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,120
They say it must be so hard
to go through that every month.

327
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,876
Sometimes, it seemed like
those who don't know

328
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,796
could understand and empathize better.

329
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,967
Maybe that's why

330
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,179
the male doctors
in our department are much more liked.

331
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,557
The mothers and patients
love Jae-il the most.

332
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,935
And Prof. Ryu Jae-hui
is the superstar of our hospital.

333
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,564
So what I mean is

334
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,484
I hope you don't think
OB-GYN isn't for you

335
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,570
just because you're a guy.

336
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,488
Doctor?

337
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,614
Yes?

338
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,116
I'm not thinking about anything right now.

339
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,660
I'm totally fine.

340
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,454
It's not a subject I'm too interested in.

341
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,791
Is that so?

342
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,459
Thank you.

343
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,295
Sure.

344
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,342
Damn. I had a speech prepared.

345
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,474
Gosh.

346
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,436
Sorry, I'm still a first-year resident.

347
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,900
The EBW's 3,200.

348
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,986
Amniotic fluid levels are fine.

349
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,615
The umbilical artery Doppler
looks good too.

350
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,577
I'm also scheduled to have
a detailed brain ultrasound today.

351
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,256
Gosh, it's taking too long.

352
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,760
I don't have much experience
with the brain yet.

353
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,388
I'll look at a bit more
and tell you. I'm sorry.

354
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,308
That…

355
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,153
That square thing is the CSP.

356
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,073
You need to measure
from where the CSP is visible.

357
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,993
Yes, I know that too, but…

358
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,456
Where the atrium's at its largest

359
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,876
and when the borders look clear,

360
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,211
that's when you should measure.

361
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,090
Keep it straight and try again.

362
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,758
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,057
Hey, Yi-young.

364
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,687
You still take forever
to read an ultrasound.

365
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,688
ULTRASOUND ROOM 5

366
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,481
You struggled more than last week.

367
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,233
I'm sorry, Professor.

368
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,360
Like in my case… I mean,

369
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,363
when they're almost due
like patient Geum Sae-byeok,

370
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,574
even lying down
to get in position is tough.

371
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,493
Precision and speed is crucial. Okay?

372
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,995
Yes, Professor.

373
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,039
Thank you, ma'am.

374
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,751
But getting the right angle
is harder than you expect.

375
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,796
You have to get the angle
as soon as the probe touches the abdomen.

376
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,757
But that takes more
than practicing a few times.

377
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,592
Let's try again tomorrow.

378
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,844
Let's get it down
to three minutes tomorrow.

379
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,638
Again? Tomorrow?

380
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,473
What? You don't want to?

381
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,935
I'm lending you my body to teach you,
but you don't want to?

382
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,937
No, I do. It sounds good.

383
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,896
Right?

384
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,564
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

385
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,490
I'm coming now.

386
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,451
Don't eat! Wait for me. I said I'm coming!

387
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,167
You said you'd be quick.
What took you so long?

388
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,336
I was about to keel over from hunger.

389
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,463
Weren't ultrasounds done a while ago?

390
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,924
They were, but then…

391
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,095
Did you know Prof. Seo had a junior?

392
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,556
Yeah. Her daughter's in middle school,
and I think her son's nine.

393
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,933
No, not that kind of junior.

394
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,810
You mean Prof. Geum, right?

395
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,354
Yeah. She's due next week,
but she won't rest.

396
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,313
She's worse than Seo.

397
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,941
It's her first year as a professor.
She's full of passion.

398
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,735
Whatever it may be,
overdoing anything's not good.

399
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,696
People should know when to stop.

400
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,615
I know. I don't want to learn,
but she insists on teaching me.

401
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,951
You're so unlucky.

402
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,619
How did you get an OB prof?

403
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,955
She's a patient
but also your superior and professor.

404
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,418
If you do her sutures wrong,
you'll hear about it for four years.

405
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,337
Damn it.

406
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,297
This is so annoying.

407
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,590
Sounds like a headache, Yi-young.

408
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,510
But this is really good.

409
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,804
It tasted better last time.

410
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,930
You've had this before?

411
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,724
Yeah, with Jae-il last time.

412
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,184
The two of you? Why?

413
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,102
Where?

414
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,022
Wait, does Jae-il like you?

415
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,231
Are you two dating?

416
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,274
This again?

417
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,442
It's not like that.

418
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,610
You two were fighting,
so he said to give you space,

419
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,362
and we went to outpatient care to eat.

420
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,740
Still, though.

421
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,326
Why go there at night? You're not dating.

422
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,077
There's no one there at night.

423
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,331
No, there are people. Jae-il said he saw.

424
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,248
He did?

425
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,083
Who?

426
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,005
I don't know.

427
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,923
I didn't ask.

428
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,927
Where's Jae-il?

429
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,512
He's going to sleep after surgery.

430
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,597
He hasn't slept in days.

431
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,612
MEDICAL ATTIRE RECOMMENDATIONS
TO PREVENT INFECTIONS

432
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,602
GUARDIAN WAITING ROOM

433
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,635
Help!

434
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,846
Someone help!

435
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,192
Help.

436
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,285
You know how sometimes
after laparoscopic surgery,

437
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,663
patients say their legs feel numb
or even paralyzed?

438
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,873
It's totally true.

439
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,250
I still can't feel my leg.

440
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,296
You had breakfast, coffee,
and went to the convenience store.

441
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,173
Since we're done, I can go now, right?

442
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,883
Wait.

443
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,263
Could you give me my lab coat?

444
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
Hey!

445
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,381
I need those pens.

446
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,346
That should do it, right? I'm going.

447
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,432
Sa-bi, when will you be back?

448
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,516
Around lunchtime?

449
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,977
Or at 4:00 p.m. after surgery?

450
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,062
I won't be back.

451
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,313
Then what about lunch?

452
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,564
You figure it out.

453
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,024
I'm not eating today.

454
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,861
I'm not good at using the wheelchair yet.

455
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,321
I can't go to the cafeteria alone.

456
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,531
All the patients manage fine on their own.

457
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,532
Hey, come on.

458
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,830
Fine! I'll call you after surgery.

459
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,958
You have to come. I'll be waiting.

460
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,000
I said fine!

461
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,379
Jae-il, you're so annoying!

462
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,549
Bye!

463
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:57,973
You scared me!

464
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,397
We need to check on Ms. Ku Yun-ja, right?

465
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,815
Yes.

466
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,070
There's nothing much
to be happy about today.

467
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,488
But you're in a good mood.

468
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,406
No, I'm not.

469
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:19,411
I feel so much pain
and embarrassment right now,

470
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,621
I can't even lift my face.

471
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,168
Let's go.

472
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,302
How did you get hurt at a hospital?

473
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,222
Don't worry about me.
I'll bounce right back.

474
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,393
After getting
anti-cancer treatment for a while,

475
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,979
your hands and feet
might start to peel like this.

476
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,981
I'll prescribe you some ointment.

477
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,399
Okay.

478
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,193
By the way,

479
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,031
the others in my ward who I used to get
anti-cancer treatment with…

480
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,330
Maybe their schedules
didn't work out this time?

481
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,957
Starting from this round,

482
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,959
maybe they're going
to a different hospital.

483
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,421
You're a terrible liar.

484
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,799
I heard they're all gone.

485
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:16,843
Yes.

486
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,511
So you've heard.

487
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,015
Suk-ja sat over there,
and I heard she passed last month.

488
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,642
And Geun-yeong from Namyangju

489
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,895
passed after receiving
anti-cancer treatment.

490
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:28,938
Yes.

491
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,191
She developed acute sepsis.

492
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,943
When I saw her last,

493
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,238
she smiled brightly and waved at me.

494
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,699
I knew her time was coming.

495
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,621
But the size of your tumor
has gotten much smaller.

496
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,623
This drug is working well.

497
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,917
Really?

498
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,587
You're not lying to me
just to make me feel better, right?

499
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,214
Of course not.

500
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,298
Why would I lie for no--

501
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,342
You're weak because you haven't eaten!

502
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,345
I'm going to rot away
when I'm dead anyway.

503
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,431
Why do you keep telling me to eat?

504
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,518
They're fighting again.

505
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,020
You should go.

506
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,231
Who else is going to stop them?

507
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,190
All right.

508
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,652
You have to eat to continue the treatment.

509
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,487
It doesn't sit in my stomach well.

510
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,781
I can't force it down
because you tell me to.

511
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,076
My goodness.

512
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,160
Hello.

513
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,496
What's the issue today?

514
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,624
You don't eat,
so that's why your illness came back.

515
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,545
That's why I said to just leave me to die.

516
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,088
I've had to hear that

517
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,757
for over ten years!

518
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,135
If you want to go that badly,

519
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,971
don't make your own sister
suffer from taking care of you!

520
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,099
Ma'am, are you having trouble eating?

521
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,893
She's refused food since yesterday.

522
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,020
They say she has to eat to be treated.

523
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,106
But she won't listen to me.

524
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,068
Ma'am, you have to eat well.

525
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,613
We switched your meals to porridge
to make it easier to eat.

526
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,199
You should eat well to start treatment

527
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,034
so you can get well soon and go home.

528
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,288
Yes, I have to go home.

529
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,873
Seong-chan.

530
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,542
Don't worry about me, son.

531
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:16,713
You didn't have to bring
all these things here to the hospital.

532
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,923
I'm sure you're busy with school as it is.

533
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,177
There you go again.

534
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,721
Yesterday, he was your dad and you wept.

535
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,347
Today, he's your son?

536
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,267
Your son Seong-chan

537
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,937
was cared by his mother
for ten years before he passed.

538
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,564
Did you forget?

539
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,984
You awful brat.

540
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,445
Don't say that in front of him.

541
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,365
You're an adult in your fifties.
Don't say that to your nephew.

542
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,950
Listen,

543
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,454
I turned 70 a while ago. Okay?

544
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,624
Geez, the old woman's
completely lost her mind.

545
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,129
But you know why
your aunt's being like this, right?

546
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,589
She's out of it.

547
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,592
Yes, of course.

548
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,136
Please eat your porridge today…

549
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,474
Mother.

550
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,662
Thank you for helping
with the surgery, Professor.

551
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,414
Maybe I overdid it yesterday.
My stomach feels a bit tight.

552
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,792
I only did the fundal.

553
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,628
-But are you okay?
-Yes.

554
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,421
I don't think so.

555
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,966
She's had pain all morning,

556
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,551
and she doesn't look so great.

557
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,762
I think she's in labor for real,

558
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,348
but she insists it's false labor
and keeps working.

559
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,809
Wow, Yi-young,

560
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,228
spoken like her attending doctor.

561
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,731
Yes, but she won't listen to her doctor.

562
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,192
All right, Dr. Oh.

563
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,862
We did a study last time, right?

564
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,532
False labor can sometimes
be as regular as true labor.

565
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,909
But it's fading on its own right now.

566
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,953
This is false labor.

567
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,624
So you can still work a bit more?

568
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,627
Yes, I have a pile of things
to get through right now.

569
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,170
Next Wednesday is my due date,

570
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,715
but I'm not sure if I can finish by then.

571
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,967
Since you're always like this,

572
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,594
this is why people keep asking

573
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,554
if we're sisters.

574
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,930
Really?

575
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,141
That's a total compliment for me.

576
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,395
You don't need to worry about me.

577
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,148
I've handled so many deliveries
in my career.

578
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,065
You know?

579
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,276
"Oh, the cervix is about to open."

580
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,195
"If I start pushing now,
the baby will be out in ten minutes."

581
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,197
I know everything. Really.

582
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,866
The VD simulation is over.

583
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,244
You think delivering a patient's baby
is the same as having your own?

584
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,747
I'm telling you.
Come see for yourself next week.

585
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,832
You'll only have to cut the cord
when you arrive,

586
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,918
because I'll have the baby
out and waiting.

587
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,128
-Fine, so just get some rest now.
-Okay.

588
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,965
You better not let
your water break in the OR

589
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,800
and have to be dragged
to the delivery room.

590
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,427
What kind of person would do that?

591
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,097
What kind?
The kind who's been here this whole time.

592
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,642
That's so cool.

593
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,352
You're so cool!

594
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,854
-Call me if you need help.
-I will.

595
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,105
Nice work.

596
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,023
Bye.

597
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,194
Thank you, Professor.

598
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,618
Are you okay?

599
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,411
Should I call Prof. Seo back?

600
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,329
No.

601
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,583
At this rate,

602
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,920
my due date might come earlier.

603
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,380
By about a day at best.

604
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,341
You know that?

605
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,509
Of course.

606
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,886
I've been doing this for years.
I just know.

607
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,681
This is killing me.

608
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,558
Yes, Professor?

609
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,062
BP? All of a sudden? And the baby?

610
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,775
There aren't any?

611
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,735
Yes, I'll be right there.

612
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,240
A surgery just came in.

613
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,199
Again?

614
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,827
You must be so tired.

615
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,204
No, I'm just assisting. It's okay.

616
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,706
I see. Assisting.

617
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,835
Good luck then.

618
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,920
Where are you going?

619
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,882
I'm going to eat.

620
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,303
They don't have a second assistant,
so I said you'd come too.

621
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,805
Me?

622
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,266
-Me too?
-Yeah.

623
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,642
Shall we?

624
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,560
It's urgent.

625
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,272
Gosh, my back.

626
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,691
It's fine.

627
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,860
I'm fine.

628
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,695
Thanks.

629
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,460
You're writing a death certificate.

630
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,172
Yes.

631
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,762
Do you know why I chose OB-GYN?

632
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,474
Instead of death certificates,

633
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,392
I wanted to write birth certificates.

634
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,148
And the only place in the hospital

635
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,067
where people celebrate
and are happy about crying

636
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,944
is OB-GYN.

637
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,115
It's where a lot of great things happen.

638
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,909
That's what I'm trying to say.

639
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:38,868
Doctor.

640
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,036
Yes?

641
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,999
Up until today, I've written
only four death certificates.

642
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,921
And two were from GYN.

643
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,924
Is that so?

644
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,801
One patient had late-stage cancer

645
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,844
and passed
after just a few chemo sessions.

646
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,848
The other was my age.
Her ovarian cancer recurred.

647
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,017
When that happened,

648
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,646
I really cried a lot.

649
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,859
I see. That was GYN.

650
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,697
I have to check on a patient.

651
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,574
Have a nice day.

652
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,201
All right.

653
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,828
See you.

654
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,207
He's smarter than I thought.

655
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,380
Aren't sisters usually close though?

656
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,757
I have a brother.

657
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,843
Ask Yi-young about sisters.

658
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,554
The patient in Room 1014 and her sister

659
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,305
lived together their whole lives,

660
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,224
but they fight so intensely,

661
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,934
saying the other should die first.

662
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,811
After taking care
of her sister for so long,

663
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,354
the younger one seems exhausted.

664
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,981
She's always very irritable.

665
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,277
The saying, "Long-term illnesses
will wear anyone down," seems so sad.

666
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,949
You can go by yourself from here, right?

667
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,159
I'm leaving.

668
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,288
Take me just up to the ward.

669
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,583
My arms hurt so much
from pushing this thing.

670
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,133
But I looked into it,

671
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,802
and that kind of nerve compression
clears in two hours.

672
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,470
That's a lie.

673
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,471
I still can't move it.

674
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,182
So I was thinking,

675
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,476
can't we clock out together?

676
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,520
-I'm going to read papers before I leave.
-Really?

677
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,314
Really? I will too. Let's do it together.

678
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,319
Actually, I'm going to review
surgery recordings instead.

679
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,571
I was going to do that too.

680
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,031
Want to watch together?

681
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,534
Hey, do you…

682
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,246
Ouch, that's hot!

683
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,879
I can walk.

684
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,050
Look. I wonder when it got better.

685
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,009
This is amazing.

686
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,597
I forgot I have to go to the ward.

687
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,848
I'm late.

688
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,435
Can you return that for me?

689
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,394
Bye!

690
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,695
Does he really like me?

691
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,865
This isn't a bad thing.

692
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,700
What's so good about that bed?

693
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,411
Hello.

694
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,830
Is something the matter?

695
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,082
Doctor.

696
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,167
Why does she have to move
next to the door?

697
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,002
I already told her.

698
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,005
Well,

699
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,466
the bed remote and call bell are broken.

700
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,386
So until we can get the bed fixed,

701
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,638
the facilities team asked us to move.

702
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,348
Can't she just use it?

703
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,310
I don't want her to move.

704
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,396
There might not be a window there,

705
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,564
but we can come quicker to check her,

706
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,942
it's closer to the bathroom,
and has many more benefits.

707
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,070
My back's about to break
from taking care of her.

708
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,782
I can't move this old woman on my own.

709
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,201
I will help you with that.

710
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,036
My leg's all better now too.

711
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,586
I've been in hospitals for a long time,

712
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,297
but this is a first.

713
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,632
Can we just--

714
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,510
Gosh, you talk too much, Mi-yeong.

715
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,972
Just listen and do what he says, will you?

716
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,392
Your brother-in-law's
always done the best for me.

717
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,727
I've told you repeatedly

718
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,146
he is the head of our household.

719
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,522
He takes Father's place.

720
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,609
A drunkard who led our family to ruin?
Head of the household, my foot.

721
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,446
How can you still call him your husband?

722
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,573
Gosh, I'm sorry.

723
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,284
I should have married her off

724
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,119
and sent her away.

725
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,580
But what can I do?

726
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,498
She's my only family.

727
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,044
I hope you understand, dear.

728
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,296
I'll talk to her.

729
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:02,923
It's fine…

730
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,928
My… dear.

731
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,473
Thank you, dear.

732
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:24,945
This.

733
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,572
And this.

734
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,366
-That's enough.
-And this.

735
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,118
This.

736
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,661
-Can you eat all of this?
-Go.

737
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,218
What?

738
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,476
But I'm not good at grilling.

739
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,728
It's okay. It's impossible
to ruin the meat here.

740
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,317
Do-won said he'd come,
but left me on read.

741
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,902
He's in surgery.

742
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,822
He's on call
and has a string of surgeries.

743
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,742
Right, he didn't even have lunch.

744
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,411
I bet he can't have dinner too.

745
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:17,998
What?

746
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,918
Since when did you
care so much about him eating?

747
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,712
I know. And now that I think about it,

748
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:28,551
last weekend, you insisted on bringing him
his socks and underwear yourself.

749
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,596
By any chance…

750
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,020
Did you borrow money from him?

751
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,231
Are those new clothes?

752
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,528
No. I've had this for a while.

753
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,612
How much did you borrow?

754
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,323
This isn't the first time, right?

755
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,616
Are you serious?

756
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,368
Here's your beer.

757
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,494
Thank you.

758
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,122
Answer me.

759
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,373
I said I didn't.

760
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,667
Instead of blaming the innocent,
just drink your beer.

761
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,919
You're telling the truth, right?

762
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,671
You better not ask him for money or else.

763
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,846
Gosh, how long has it been
since you had beer?

764
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,141
Six months.

765
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,727
We're skipping the procedure this month,

766
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,146
so I'm going to chug all the beer I want.

767
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,531
That hits the spot.

768
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,826
I'm so happy.

769
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,995
How did you manage
without beer for six months?

770
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,246
If only I could get pregnant,

771
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,832
I'd quit drinking beer forever.

772
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,335
But I'm not, so I have to keep drinking.

773
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,003
I think one won't be enough.

774
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,422
Excuse me! Could we have--

775
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,592
-Are you okay? I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

776
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,304
Yi-young?

777
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,972
What are you doing here?

778
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,475
I'm eating out. You?

779
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,018
Me? I'm…

780
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,438
Hello.

781
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,816
I'm Yi-young's friend, Pyo Nam-kyung.

782
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,027
Oh, my. You're her friend?

783
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,238
We're not friends.

784
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,822
See you tomorrow.

785
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,578
It's hot.

786
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,293
Don't talk about Do-won.

787
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,267
I hope I'm not cluelessly
imposing on a family dinner.

788
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,268
You are.

789
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,062
I was supposed to meet a friend here,

790
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,314
but they suddenly said
they couldn't make it.

791
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,316
I didn't want to eat here alone

792
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,818
and was just about to leave.

793
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,028
Thank you so much.

794
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,863
We're the ones who are grateful.

795
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,324
I've never had a meal
with a friend of Yi-young's before.

796
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,367
It's so nice.

797
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,577
I said we're not friends.

798
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,413
Yi-young and I
went to the same high school.

799
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,790
And we ended up at the same hospital.

800
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:05,749
How cool is that?

801
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,710
Wow, you two go way back!

802
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,630
Please take good care of my sister-in-law.

803
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,843
She's such a mess, so I worry about her.

804
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,137
Is she doing okay?

805
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,724
These days, Yi-young is…

806
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,641
Don't.

807
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,062
The professors praise her
for her accurate exams.

808
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,106
And of all the first-years,

809
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,858
she's the fastest ultrasound reader.

810
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:32,651
Really?

811
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,194
But the thing is

812
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,363
she can never hold back
what she wants to say.

813
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,532
And if you ask her
to do something she dislikes,

814
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
her face turns so sour.

815
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,244
So she's adjusted well to the work,

816
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,663
but she's a bit lacking in social skills.

817
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,377
Still, I thought she'd be bad at both.
So it's such a relief.

818
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,588
Great job, Yi-young.

819
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,590
That's more than what we expected.

820
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,761
Please look out for her.

821
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,430
If she gets fired again,
she has nowhere to go.

822
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,016
Yes, I'll take good care of her.

823
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,101
Don't worry, Joo-young.

824
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,147
Since when were you two
such close friends? Geez.

825
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,982
Yeah, eat up.

826
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,319
-Thank you.
-She said "Joo-young."

827
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,738
She's a good eater.

828
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,865
That's so nice to see.

829
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,619
Wait.

830
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,247
You look a lot like someone I know.

831
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,125
Doesn't he look so similar?

832
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,753
What? I don't know.

833
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,338
I mean, his…

834
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,299
He has the same eyes and mouth!

835
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,843
Oh, my! Who was it?

836
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,053
He's…

837
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,683
Professor Jo Joon-mo!

838
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,229
If I didn't know,
I'd totally think they were brothers.

839
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,272
You look so much like him.

840
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,067
He must be really handsome then.

841
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,695
They're not similar at all.

842
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,322
We're all done, so get up.

843
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,449
Really? Let me get some more of this.

844
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,659
No, let's go home.

845
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,577
Can I just have one more plate?

846
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,621
You ate everything! Don't you have work?

847
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,498
-What's with you?
-I'll only be ten minutes.

848
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,958
Ten minutes, my foot. Put it down.

849
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,045
-Fine, eat.
-Yes.

850
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,510
Hey, Jae-il.

851
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:25,848
Hi.

852
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:26,974
Aren't you buying coffee?

853
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,392
No, I was just passing by.

854
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,768
I see. Wait.

855
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,061
I have something to tell you.

856
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,814
Well--

857
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,983
Dr. Kim's sending
thank you gifts for the wedding.

858
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,819
It's food,
so they'll be sent to our homes.

859
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,654
Can you collect the professors' addresses?

860
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,698
I'll do from the fellows
to the first-years.

861
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:44,950
Okay.

862
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:45,868
And…

863
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:48,745
What now?

864
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,165
I looked into it,

865
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,168
and sudden leg paralysis
has no aftereffects.

866
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,755
I did feel some pain yesterday.

867
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,384
But it feels totally fine today.

868
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,635
It looked fine yesterday too.

869
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,971
You said it was numb and weak,

870
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,598
but you sprang up and ran.

871
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,184
-When did I ever run?
-You did.

872
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,643
I walked slowly.

873
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,063
No, I tried to follow with the wheelchair,
but you were so fast I couldn't.

874
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,274
Gosh, you and your blasted memory.

875
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,611
I don't know why I did that either, okay?

876
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,239
Can you just forget it and let it go?

877
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,617
You're making me awkward
by poking and prying.

878
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,078
I was just worried you might be in pain.

879
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,457
Worried?

880
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,374
Yeah.

881
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:35,918
But you still fuss.

882
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,962
Were you really worried?

883
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,298
You kept worrying?

884
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,092
Doctor.

885
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,595
Prof. Geum's baby…

886
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,852
Hey.

887
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,853
Hello.

888
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,524
Professor.

889
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,735
Why didn't you call me?
I can do that for you.

890
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,028
I needed to use the bathroom.

891
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,280
I can put on NST monitors.

892
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,949
I can do it in my sleep.

893
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,371
I flashed on the monitor, didn't I?

894
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:13,914
I'm sorry.

895
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,666
It's okay as long as you're fine.

896
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,755
How's the pain?

897
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,215
The same as when I was admitted.

898
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,051
Contractions are regular
at five to seven-minute intervals.

899
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,977
Are you in pain? Where?

900
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,438
Do you want the epidural now?

901
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,773
No.

902
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,194
Let's do another exam and then decide.

903
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,404
Okay.

904
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,041
I'm sorry.

905
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,628
I'm still at 2.0, right?

906
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,380
Yes, your pelvic exam shows a 2.0,

907
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,548
and station is high.

908
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,509
I was admitted two hours ago,

909
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,138
but there's no change
in contractions or the cervix.

910
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,223
So let's wait a bit longer
for the epidural.

911
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,310
But if it hurts a lot,
do you want some painkillers?

912
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,478
I have to bear it for it to open.

913
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,691
In three hours, we can check again,

914
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,986
and decide on the oxytocin then.

915
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,404
Okay.

916
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,657
If the pain's too much, please call me.

917
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,742
I'm fine.

918
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,328
Use your time to check
on other patients instead.

919
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,248
You know Ms. Joo Ha-na on POD 2?

920
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,043
Her CBC results are out,
so can you check and tell me?

921
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,712
I couldn't check
because I was suddenly admitted.

922
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,048
You can't check patients in this state.

923
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,049
So you don't want to?

924
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,009
It's not that…

925
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,053
I guess I should go check it myself then.

926
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,680
-Can you undo this?
-No!

927
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,640
No.

928
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,850
I'll check and update you.

929
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:57,976
-Yeah?
-Yes.

930
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,312
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Oh.

931
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,480
Go and check.

932
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,107
Go on.

933
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,408
Stop eating!

934
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,578
Why are you eating so much
all of a sudden?

935
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,167
You complained like hell
about not eating before.

936
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,586
Now, you're complaining like hell
about eating too much?

937
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,090
I'm worried you might get
indigestion again!

938
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,092
They have medication for that.

939
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,387
After I eat,
I'm taking a lap around the ward.

940
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,057
You're going to walk?
You have the strength to do so?

941
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,058
Of course.

942
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,685
Hello.

943
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,063
The doctor's here.

944
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,482
I'm here to receive your consent.

945
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,651
You finished all your food today.

946
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,736
You look nice today, Doctor.

947
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,905
Did something good happen?

948
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,867
Am I the handsome Jae-il today, ma'am?

949
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,829
Hold on. What's suddenly gotten into her?

950
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,416
She's eating well, and she's lucid.

951
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,626
I don't know where she got the strength.

952
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,961
She wants to go exercise.

953
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,505
It's because she received
an albumin injection,

954
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,549
and her condition's much better now.

955
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,758
Her numbers look good too.

956
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,760
Just yesterday, she said she was dying.

957
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,471
Why is she suddenly so energetic today?

958
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,056
What good would that do?

959
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,974
But

960
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,767
that's good news.

961
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,603
Why are you upset, ma'am?

962
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,313
No, it's not that…

963
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
It's nothing.

964
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,487
If she's more energetic,
she'll do better when receiving treatment

965
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,822
and recover faster.

966
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,742
But what brings you here?

967
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,411
We'll administer
an anti-cancer drug later,

968
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,205
but as I explained before,
we changed it to a new drug.

969
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,874
So you need to sign a new consent form.

970
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,000
Should I explain it again?

971
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,752
Gosh, I know everything.

972
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:48,962
Here you go.

973
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,092
I'm sick of hearing that explanation.

974
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,262
Thank you.

975
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,607
She was sent to the ER just now.

976
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,983
She's not our patient,

977
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,486
she has ROM with labor, but it's mild.

978
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,654
-So it's not a super emergency.
-No.

979
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,656
-Tak Gi-on's there, right?
-Yes.

980
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,909
Let's be calm and steady with him. Okay?

981
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,285
Like it's no big deal.

982
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,954
-So we seem free and graceful.
-Right.

983
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,123
Don't forget. Gi-on is watching.

984
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,500
Okay, I won't.

985
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,459
Let's go.

986
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,921
RESTRICTED AREA

987
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,714
Excuse me.

988
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,883
-Hello.
-Ma'am, could you lift your legs?

989
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,682
Ma'am, I'm just going to check
to see if your water did break.

990
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,268
It may feel slightly uncomfortable.

991
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,145
It must have been a shock.

992
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,439
Just leave it to us and relax.

993
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,234
Both you and the baby will be fine.

994
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,571
I put a line in,
and I requested a CBC and blood chemistry.

995
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,407
And the patient
would like to go to her hospital--

996
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,369
No, she can't go! She can't!

997
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,082
The baby's umbilical cord is out!

998
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,166
What?

999
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,543
Call the professor! It's urgent!

1000
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,921
She needs to go to the OR now!

1001
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,048
-The transport driver.
-What?

1002
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,883
-Call them now! Hurry!
-Okay!

1003
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,094
Ma'am, the umbilical cord has fallen out,

1004
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,846
so we have to go into surgery now.

1005
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,514
Could you please come to the ER?

1006
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,808
Anesthesiology? We're bringing her up now.

1007
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:25,934
It's an emergency.

1008
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,520
We don't like it any more than you do!

1009
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,689
Pediatrics? We need to deliver a baby now.

1010
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,400
You can just come up right now yourself!

1011
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,568
Hurry!

1012
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,736
What are you doing? Quit staring!

1013
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,781
-Call the guardian and get consent now!
-Yes, ma'am!

1014
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,408
Are you okay, ma'am?

1015
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,034
Hang in there, ma'am.

1016
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,287
-We're going to move.
-I'll take a look. It's okay.

1017
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,042
Cervix is at 5.0.
There's been no change for two hours.

1018
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,669
Station's still at zero.

1019
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,132
As you prescribed,
starting oxytocin at 15.

1020
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,051
Are you okay?

1021
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:01,887
I'm fine.

1022
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,641
Dr. Oh, my request…

1023
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,934
What?

1024
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,686
Later, in the delivery room,

1025
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,980
have the interns observe.

1026
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,857
-I know. I won't forget.
-Especially…

1027
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,360
those who haven't seen a delivery yet.

1028
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,237
Yes, I'll take care of it.

1029
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:23,617
Wait! Make sure you set everything up,

1030
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,368
so they can see up close.

1031
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,078
That isn't what's important right now.

1032
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,371
Right from the incision,

1033
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,206
so they can properly see
from the beginning…

1034
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,124
Professor!

1035
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,794
I have a request too.

1036
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,712
Please…

1037
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,716
Please, can't you just focus
on the contractions?

1038
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,468
What?

1039
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,762
What did you say?

1040
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,516
I'll see you after I deliver.

1041
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,898
Son of a…

1042
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,370
Hello.

1043
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,872
We're going to administer the drug now.

1044
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,290
Now?

1045
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,377
She's asleep.

1046
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,545
I'll be back a bit later then.

1047
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,882
I'll return in about 30 minutes.

1048
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,841
That…

1049
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,971
What's wrong with that?

1050
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,139
Why is it red?

1051
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,933
Pardon?

1052
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,687
No, you can't!

1053
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,649
Don't give my sister that medicine!

1054
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,944
Give her a clear one instead.

1055
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,487
Like the one before.

1056
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,657
Not that one!

1057
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,994
But it's the drug
I explained to you last time.

1058
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,414
Mi-ja!

1059
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,792
Goodness, Mi-ja!

1060
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,004
You said you wouldn't die!

1061
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,339
You said you wanted to stay with me!

1062
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,468
Our parents are gone,
and I have no husband.

1063
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,595
If you leave me too,

1064
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,724
I really will be alone!

1065
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,312
Mi-ja! I'll be an orphan!

1066
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,442
Don't leave me, Mi-ja!

1067
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,903
Don't die, Mi-ja!

1068
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,907
Mi-ja!

1069
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,035
Mi-ja!

1070
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,415
Mi-ja!

1071
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,418
Mi-ja!

1072
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,797
Mi-ja.

1073
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,841
Here.

1074
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,473
Just be straight with me.

1075
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,724
I'm fine.

1076
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,977
Well, I'm not sure
what you want me to be straight about.

1077
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,812
I know everything.

1078
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,272
My sister…

1079
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,484
is dying.

1080
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,110
Sorry?

1081
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,946
That's why you put her near the door,

1082
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,908
so you can quickly check to see
if she's dead or not.

1083
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,576
That's why she moved.

1084
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,911
And did you see earlier?

1085
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,747
She's lucid and eating again.

1086
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,583
Before people die,

1087
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,586
they use up their last bit of strength.

1088
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,799
That's why they eat and walk like normal.

1089
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,343
It's not that though.

1090
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,928
Then what about that red drug?

1091
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,012
Red?

1092
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,306
The anti-cancer drug?

1093
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,809
That's what you give
when someone's about to die.

1094
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,561
You give it to a hopeless patient,

1095
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,189
so they can hold on for a few more days.

1096
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,650
You think I wouldn't know?

1097
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,320
They said that's how they all passed!

1098
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,489
At the bed by the door,

1099
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,909
they became fully lucid
and received that red drug.

1100
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,204
That's how they all died.

1101
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,915
That's not true.

1102
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,251
It really isn't.

1103
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,504
The bed really was broken.

1104
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,965
They're fixing it tonight, so you'll see.

1105
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,759
And she's eating well,

1106
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,178
because we drained the fluid
from her abdomen

1107
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,763
and adjusted her albumin.

1108
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,224
So her condition just improved greatly.

1109
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,393
And that red drug

1110
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,104
is used for recurrence,
so it's different from the other one.

1111
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,606
It's not for dying patients
or anything like that.

1112
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,108
Really?

1113
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,486
You're not just lying
in case I faint from shock?

1114
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,572
Why would I lie to you, ma'am?

1115
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,658
But

1116
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,995
where did you hear all that nonsense?

1117
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,583
That lady there.

1118
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,211
She said her friends all left like that.

1119
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,382
And she said my sister would die soon too.

1120
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,348
Oh, my God!

1121
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,768
What are you doing?

1122
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,021
-You can't just touch that!
-Yi-young!

1123
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,522
Don't turn it on.

1124
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,857
Turn the oxytocin off.

1125
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,567
Turn it off, damn it!

1126
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,153
What? You prescribed this yourself.

1127
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,154
I don't know.

1128
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,949
The epidural's not working
at all right now.

1129
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,159
Not at all.

1130
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,913
But these contractions need oxytocin.

1131
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,164
No!

1132
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,791
I'll be on call today.

1133
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,085
And then, I'll make the prescriptions.

1134
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,170
So turn the oxytocin off.

1135
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,838
Turn it off now!

1136
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,423
Okay, I will.

1137
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,301
Yi-young.

1138
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,346
Get me an OR.

1139
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,681
But, Professor,
I think you can wait a bit longer.

1140
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,934
No! I need surgery now!

1141
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,770
There's no change in the cervix at all.

1142
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,148
Let's just do the surgery, okay?

1143
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,566
Okay, Professor.

1144
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,984
I'll notify Professor Seo.

1145
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,320
No, I gave the order just now!

1146
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,572
Forget that and just get the OR.

1147
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,908
Anesthesiology!

1148
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,370
Are you in pain, ma'am?
Oh, dear, it must be awful.

1149
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,705
She's our professor…

1150
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,959
Ma'am, are you in a lot of pain?
You can't bear it?

1151
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:06,960
Who are you?

1152
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,045
I'm a new nurse here. It's okay, ma'am.

1153
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,380
Take a deep breath.

1154
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,344
You must have been in so much pain.

1155
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,513
The painkillers didn't work,
so it must really hurt.

1156
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,433
It's okay.
You're doing so well right now, Ms. Geum.

1157
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,519
The other mothers were crying and yelling,

1158
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,187
but you're doing so well.

1159
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,564
Doctor, an OR, please.

1160
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,024
Nurse, I don't think I can do it.

1161
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,734
-It hurts, doesn't it?
-It's so…

1162
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,028
It hurts so much. I had no idea it would!

1163
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,115
Anesthesiology? Is there a free OR?

1164
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,703
Make sure to check on the patient.

1165
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,121
Yes, ma'am.

1166
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,748
Still, it's a relief.

1167
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,126
The baby's saturation went up quick,

1168
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,794
and the mother didn't bleed much.

1169
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,671
Yeah, it was a relief.

1170
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:55,758
Tak Gi-on!

1171
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,637
He saw everything, right?

1172
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,768
I think we were screaming
like animals earlier.

1173
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:06,686
Right?

1174
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,813
No wonder my throat's sore.

1175
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,235
Gosh, next year's going to be a tough one.

1176
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,239
I'll find out if there's another intern
we can persuade.

1177
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,617
Okay, let's find one.

1178
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,828
I'm sure we'll find one.

1179
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,080
Hey, Gi-on!

1180
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,628
Hey, what are you doing?
I've been calling you.

1181
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,463
I'm looking something up.

1182
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,590
The patient
with the prolapsed cord earlier?

1183
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,507
Yeah.

1184
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,471
Holy cow.

1185
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,182
The baby and mother are fine.

1186
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,850
They must be in their room already.

1187
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,272
When I saw the OB doctors
screaming earlier,

1188
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,649
I thought the patient was dying.

1189
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,486
Man, OB is so scary.

1190
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,113
Really?

1191
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,449
I thought it was pretty awesome.

1192
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,997
-See you later.
-Bye.

1193
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,460
-Yi-young?
-Yes?

1194
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,381
When the uterine incision is made,

1195
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,840
that's the most important part.

1196
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,428
She says to come closer to watch
without getting contaminated.

1197
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,596
-Yes, Doctor.
-Yes, Doctor.

1198
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,433
Thanks, Dr. Oh.

1199
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,518
Ma'am.

1200
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,229
Don't worry about anything else now,

1201
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,148
and just focus on the baby.
You're a mother now, not a professor.

1202
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,692
Yes, Professor.

1203
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,277
Let's get started.

1204
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,404
Excuse me, Professor?

1205
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,156
Do you remember my request?

1206
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,908
You have to do it for me, okay?

1207
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,910
You really want to go through with it?

1208
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:46,953
Yes.

1209
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,039
Well, if that's what you want…

1210
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,999
Then that's what we'll do.

1211
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,838
Do you need something?

1212
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,256
No.

1213
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,176
We have a lot of eyes observing today.
I want you to stay focused.

1214
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:03,761
Yes, ma'am.

1215
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,514
Scalpel.

1216
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,226
ANESTHESIA TIME, SURGERY TIME

1217
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,103
ANESTHESIA TIME, CURRENT TIME,
SURGERY TIME

1218
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,105
SURGERY TIME

1219
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,149
The baby's coming out.

1220
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,699
It's out!

1221
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:25,867
Hi!

1222
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,869
It's 4:15 p.m., and it's a baby girl.

1223
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,665
Ma'am,

1224
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,500
the baby's healthy.

1225
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,586
She's so beautiful.

1226
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,421
Thank you, Professor.

1227
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,176
Now, we'll deliver the placenta
and close up.

1228
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,052
You may feel some discomfort.

1229
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,681
Yi-young, I need you
to do something for me today.

1230
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,850
It was Professor Geum's wish

1231
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,811
for a first-year resident to close her up.

1232
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:54,896
What?

1233
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:55,980
Didn't you hear earlier?

1234
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,774
That was her last request.

1235
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,610
Oh, my God.

1236
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,946
There's no bleeding,
and the baby's healthy.

1237
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,282
We just need you to wrap things up now.

1238
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,159
I'm okay.

1239
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,870
I mean,
I think it'll be good if I don't do it.

1240
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,456
That's what I thought you'd say,
so I'm telling you now.

1241
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,540
We don't have time.

1242
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,253
Not everyone
gets a chance like this, Dr. Oh.

1243
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,798
I'm fine. Really.

1244
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,967
I'm scared. What if I mess up?

1245
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,512
Don't mess up then. We'll be watching.

1246
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,347
Just do as you've learned.

1247
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,723
Don't worry.

1248
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,187
Yi-young, take the lead.

1249
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,083
You'll have to do it someday.

1250
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,836
Aren't you here to be a doctor?
You can't be scared forever.

1251
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,755
Make a good edge,

1252
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,550
and you know you have to
avoid the endometrium to not damage it

1253
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,218
when you suture, right?

1254
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,053
I'll do my best to assist you.

1255
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,806
Don't worry and take the lead.

1256
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,074
Get started.

1257
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,994
Do-won, tie up where the incision starts.

1258
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:33,911
Yes, ma'am.

1259
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,766
Lift the thread up higher and pull.

1260
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,978
There you go. You're doing well.

1261
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,531
Dr. Oh, what should I do?

1262
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,241
Please pull a little harder.

1263
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,370
Yes, Doctor.

1264
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,981
Doctor.

1265
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,943
Yes? Are you all right?

1266
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,570
Did I do that again?

1267
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:52,198
Did I get confused and say nonsense?

1268
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,617
No, ma'am.

1269
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:56,661
You just

1270
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,873
briefly visited a few times
with some people you'd been missing.

1271
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:07,296
Then, right now,
I guess I wanted to see you.

1272
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,175
Doctor.

1273
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,304
While I'm still lucid,

1274
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,434
I'd like to ask you for just one favor.

1275
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,479
Would you be able to do that for me?

1276
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,147
What is it?

1277
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:31,028
No matter how much I say no,
you never listen, do you?

1278
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,614
Did you secretly find out
when you're going to die?

1279
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:37,284
You always ask to take a funeral photo.
What's so good about it?

1280
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,578
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

1281
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,915
It's my last goodbye to everyone.

1282
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:49,588
So it's better to take it while looking
as young and beautiful as possible.

1283
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,425
Beautiful? You're all old now.

1284
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,223
Since when did we become this old?

1285
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,898
You've become older than Mom, Mi-ja.

1286
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:13,029
That's because Mom passed when she was 50.

1287
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,449
But you're…

1288
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:23,289
My little sister is so beautiful.

1289
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:24,957
You are.

1290
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,377
I'm not!

1291
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,881
I'm 75 years old.

1292
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:37,928
Still, my little sister will forever
be beautiful in my eyes.

1293
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,555
You will.

1294
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,308
Let's hurry and take the photo!

1295
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,310
The doctor's busy too.

1296
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:46,979
Ma'am!

1297
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,566
You and the background.
Everything looks perfect.

1298
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,113
Where did you get a camera?

1299
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,407
From my bag. It has everything.

1300
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,536
Okay, here we go!

1301
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:04,455
Please look here.

1302
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,209
One, two, three!

1303
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:09,794
Wah-wah!

1304
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,340
It looks nice.

1305
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,179
I'll get this developed
and give it to you at the next treatment.

1306
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,098
Okay, thank you.

1307
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,610
Would you like one together?

1308
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:38,322
Forget it. We're too old for pictures.

1309
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,449
This is a good camera though.

1310
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,409
No, thanks.

1311
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:46,288
Come on, let's take a picture.
Just one. Please?

1312
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,207
I said it's okay.

1313
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,416
Come on, right now!

1314
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,710
I have a lot of work to get to.

1315
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,462
-I have to go soon. Hurry.
-Goodness…

1316
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,718
How lovely.

1317
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:01,804
You two look like young ladies.

1318
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,600
All right. Just relax and smile!

1319
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:07,643
Here I go!

1320
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,402
Let's take one more.

1321
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:26,954
Okay.

1322
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:31,167
One, two, three.

1323
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,843
She said she'd deliver her own baby.

1324
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,637
She underestimated the pain.

1325
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,347
Do you know how much it hurts?

1326
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,058
It's not like delivering a patient's baby.

1327
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:52,855
By the way,
do you think our age-old OB tradition

1328
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,231
will work on Yi-young too?

1329
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:57,484
"The OB professor's doctor
sticks with OB."

1330
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,944
You've never heard that before?

1331
01:09:59,028 --> 01:09:59,945
I have.

1332
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,448
When my professor gave birth,
I was her doctor.

1333
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,867
Sae-byeok was my doctor
when I had Seok-hun.

1334
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,827
-When you had your second child?
-Yeah.

1335
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,371
We both considered joining GYN,

1336
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,873
but at our professors' deliveries,

1337
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:13,375
we sutured for the first time ever
and joined OB.

1338
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,171
I wonder if this tradition
will work again or not.

1339
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,839
Instead of tradition,

1340
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,758
I think food or sleep
would work on her more.

1341
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:21,675
Really?

1342
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:25,095
Then, to congratulate and persuade her,

1343
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,265
should we take her out
to eat something good?

1344
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:31,352
Do you think she'll be able to eat today?

1345
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:34,730
Right.

1346
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,359
She took the lead for the first time.

1347
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,987
She sutured the uterus
and closed up the patient on her own.

1348
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,823
Her heart's probably still pounding,

1349
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,408
so she can't even drink water.

1350
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,661
Right. Let's take her out next time.

1351
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,163
Gosh, Yi-young.

1352
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,209
Gosh, I bet she won't get
any sleep tonight.

1353
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,845
Yes?

1354
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,724
I was called, right? Right?

1355
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:11,642
What?

1356
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,520
I think Prof. Geum called me.

1357
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,481
Is she bleeding? Is she in pain?

1358
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:18,983
I didn't hear.

1359
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,165
Dr. Oh.

1360
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,835
How many times are you going to check?

1361
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,670
I'm just nervous.

1362
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,256
It was my first time suturing,

1363
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,925
and I think I pulled
too hard on the skin earlier.

1364
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,305
It's okay.
That's how you learn and get better.

1365
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,311
But did you pull really hard?

1366
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,481
Professor, I've never seen this before.

1367
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,985
I was in the OB ward for a year
at another hospital.

1368
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:06,030
But I've never seen
a dressing site this clean before.

1369
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,908
I'm the one who taught her
how to do stitches.

1370
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,410
I think you're okay.

1371
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,292
I'll be back in an hour

1372
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,002
to check for bleeding.

1373
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,546
You don't have to come back.
Let me sleep, please!

1374
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,756
I'll see you later!

1375
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:24,923
Goodness' sake.

1376
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,097
Were you unable to go home because of me?

1377
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,724
Yes.

1378
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,144
I'm sorry. You didn't have to stay.

1379
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,940
I could've gone home but didn't.

1380
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,400
I wanted to pay you back.

1381
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,697
Starting from today,
I wanted pay you back little by little.

1382
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,533
But I wasn't much help, right?

1383
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,370
It'll take ages to pay you back.

1384
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,414
No, you don't have to pay me back.

1385
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,708
There's no need for that.

1386
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:19,395
Okay, I'll take a look before we begin.

1387
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:23,107
Even with the numbing cream,
it might still sting.

1388
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,443
But please try not to move.

1389
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,779
If it hurts, raise your right hand.

1390
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:30,739
Okay?

1391
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,249
After that, I couldn't bring myself
to reach out to you.

1392
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,085
Because of me,

1393
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,629
rumors spread
that you punched a senior doctor.

1394
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,217
Baseless rumors usually spread fast.

1395
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,218
I know, right?

1396
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,139
You didn't punch him. You bit him.

1397
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,688
Hey, you crazy idiot!

1398
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,523
Ow! My hand!

1399
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,318
I need this hand for surgeries! Please!

1400
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:09,486
Okay!

1401
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,240
The skin clinic went under.

1402
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,660
It got bad reviews for poor quality.

1403
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:23,167
I think it started to get bad
after you bit his hand.

1404
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:25,252
That's why I bit him.

1405
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,216
After him, was there anyone else
who was like that?

1406
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,093
Of course not.

1407
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,846
These days, I do the touching.

1408
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,182
That's a relief.

1409
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,690
It's been an hour. I'll get going first.

1410
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,192
Where are you going?

1411
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,359
To see Prof. Geum.

1412
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,988
But she said not to.
She told you to go home now.

1413
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,281
I'm worried she might bleed.

1414
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,366
I'll just check one more time before I go.

1415
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:00,954
Wait for me, Doctor!

1416
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,789
You can go home!

1417
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,041
I'll come with you.

1418
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,250
Aren't you busy?

1419
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,585
I'm not.

1420
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,013
KU DO-WON
109/1404 DONGHAE APT, SINWOO-DONG, JUNG-GU

1421
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,973
Right, the address for the wedding gifts.

1422
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,019
OH YI-YOUNG
109/1404 DONGHAE APT, SINWOO-DONG, JUNG-GU

1423
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,527
PYO NAM-KYUNG

1424
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,153
Hey, Nam-kyung.

1425
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,740
A hot herbal tea for me.

1426
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:37,866
Hey, Yi-young and…

1427
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,661
Never mind. I'll tell you in the lounge.

1428
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:42,538
Okay, come quick.

1429
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:49,211
Dr. Ku?

1430
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,380
-Hi.
-It is you!

1431
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,173
I thought you were someone else.

1432
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,968
With that hat, you look like someone else.

1433
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,803
My hair was flattened by my surgical cap.

1434
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,389
Going somewhere?

1435
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:01,890
Out to eat.

1436
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,559
-Where?
-Near the hospital.

1437
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:04,935
With who?

1438
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:07,563
My sister-in-law. Why?
Want to know what we're eating too?

1439
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:08,814
No.

1440
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,066
I was wondering
if it was with your girlfriend.

1441
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,736
Instead of wondering
if I had a girlfriend,

1442
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,114
shouldn't you be more curious
about Seon Min-seon's BP?

1443
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,492
And without discharge notes,
we can't prescribe anything.

1444
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,451
So when will you…

1445
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:25,122
Oh, my. My coffee's getting cold.

1446
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,248
I'll get going.

1447
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,459
Hi!

1448
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,338
-Did you wait long?
-No.

1449
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,298
It's Joo-young.

1450
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:35,424
Are you okay to leave?

1451
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,925
Yeah. Aren't you cold?

1452
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,927
-They look too thin.
-No, I'm fine.

1453
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:42,222
That's Yi-young's sister.
Why did he say that's his sister-in-law?

1454
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,650
Dr. Cha thinks this is Dr. Ku.

1455
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,612
It could be him. Or not.

1456
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:01,033
Hey, think of him as Dr. Ku and look.

1457
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,827
HELP US FIND THIS MAN WHO SAVED A LIFE

1458
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,538
It is. I think it's him!

1459
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,666
Or maybe not.

1460
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,752
Hey! I have something big to tell you!

1461
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,920
-This is huge!
-Hey, this is bigger. Look.

1462
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,047
No, this isn't important.

1463
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,965
No, this is more important. Look at this.

1464
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,258
Doesn't he look like Dr. Ku?

1465
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,135
-Hey, that's…
-What?

1466
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,678
That is Dr. Ku.

1467
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,388
Really? How could you tell right away?

1468
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,141
The hat. That's Dr. Ku.

1469
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,770
It really must be him.

1470
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,856
Who's the woman with him?

1471
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,150
She aided like a professional.

1472
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:36,943
Is she from our hospital?

1473
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,072
I've seen those clothes before.

1474
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,581
You're right! It's Yi-young!

1475
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,166
It is her!

1476
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,959
It is them! The two of them!

1477
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,503
What? Hey!

1478
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,505
How did you know?

1479
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:57,714
You knew too?

1480
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,258
Yeah, I found out by coincidence.

1481
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,511
But I thought I should wait
until they told us.

1482
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:03,804
Hey, you traitors.

1483
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:05,764
You knew, but why didn't you tell me?

1484
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,641
Hey, how did you know?

1485
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:08,600
Did you see too?

1486
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,435
Yeah, I did. They're…

1487
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:12,854
-Living together.
-Dating?

1488
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,314
In-laws?

1489
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:18,151
Wait, hold on…

1490
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,152
What did you just say?

1491
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,278
You said they're what?

1492
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,488
I don't know.

1493
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,323
Wait, hold on. So…

1494
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,282
They're in-laws, but…

1495
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,242
They live together.

1496
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,202
And they're dating?

1497
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,245
-What?
-What?

1498
01:18:28,745 --> 01:18:29,871
What?

1499
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,748
What are you talking about?

1500
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,874
That doesn't make sense.

1501
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,836
They're in-laws, so they could
live together for various reasons.

1502
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:38,046
But they wouldn't date.

1503
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:40,590
What?

1504
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:46,847
But why are they wearing the same shoes?

1505
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,517
Was it a group purchase
because they live together?

1506
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,504
I'm off to have lunch with my sister.

1507
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:21,506
Hey, Yi-young!

1508
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:23,049
What?

1509
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,260
-It's true!
-Oh, my God, Yi-young!

1510
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:26,261
Hey!

1511
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:27,512
You…

1512
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,017
What is it?

1513
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,145
What?

1514
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,945
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST,
JUNG MOON-SUNG, OUR ETERNAL DO JAE-HAK

1515
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:28,782
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1516
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:32,369
I'll give birth
on January 1st at midnight.

1517
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:34,663
I said not yet!

1518
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:37,415
-Ma'am.
-Can we wait a bit?

1519
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,543
The baby's the one
who chooses when to come out.

1520
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,419
Doctor.

1521
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,420
What is it?

1522
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,091
Have you decided
on who the new OR professor will be?

1523
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,051
Our new OB professor will be…

1524
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:49,135
Yes, Professor.

1525
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,137
-So?
-For real?

1526
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,514
You two are…

1527
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:53,849
We're dating. Happy now?

1528
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,100
You'll be double in-laws?

1529
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,935
There's another couple?

1530
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,145
It's such a shame. If I had a daughter…

1531
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,772
Even if you did, it wouldn't matter.

1532
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,107
A secret relationship, my foot.

1533
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:06,152
When did I buy this?

1534
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,780
I'm not doing my second year.

1535
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,365
People like her stay the longest.

1536
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,700
It's her habit of speaking now.

1537
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:13,994
I wasn't going to tell you this, but…

1538
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:15,328
Ta-da!

1539
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:25,338
