1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,163
An attractive beautiful demon

2
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,467
who dwells in the lake
and singsto tempt confused men.

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,941
She would do anything
to have her sexual desire satisfied...

4
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:02,891
Siren X.

5
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,883
Your driving is awful.

6
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,252
I 'm sorry.

7
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,432
Are you sure... this way correct?

8
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,070
Don't ask me. This is your job.

9
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,204
Okay. I'm sorry.

10
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,842
What! We still not arrive?
I don't feel good.

11
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,376
We're almost there.
Have you brought medicines?

12
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,277
I'm sorry. I've forgot.

13
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,417
What do you remember!

14
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,681
I'm sorry. Please be patience.
We 're almost there.

15
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,789
No. I can't hold on.

16
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,825
Please don't. The equipments are there.

17
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,292
Are you alright?

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,128
Don't throw up in my bag. Do it outside.

19
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,347
How much further to the filming scene?

20
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,685
Twenty minutes to walk.

21
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,516
Oh, no way!

22
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:20,132
Do you want to bring the flash along,
Mr. Yamada?

23
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,367
I don't think we could finish our work
before sunset.

24
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,935
I don't understand how
important is the girl?

25
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,477
Just do what director's want.

26
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,050
Are you alright?

27
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,847
Not good.

28
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,052
Just get dressed.
We're gonna take some fast shot.

29
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,795
No.

30
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,523
What's wrong?

31
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,999
It is a pornography.

32
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,569
Don't say it like that.

33
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,342
Miniskirt Adventure should be well liked
if broadcasting in mid-night.

34
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,304
You must be famous very soon.

35
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,440
You give happiness to the young.

36
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,909
I said I don't like it.

37
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,307
I don't want to be a porn star

38
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,881
I wish to be an intelligent hostess

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,620
but only one team member
could manage something...

40
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,826
like adventure program.

41
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,168
Mamimi, I love you.

42
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,743
Only you could help.

43
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:55,026
Let's get it done, okay?

44
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,370
Hi, everyone.
I am the monster hunter, Mamimi.

45
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:17,206
Miniskirt Adventure is about to start.

46
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,910
We are here at the ghost lake.

47
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,987
Many male campers disappeared recently.

48
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,523
A lot of rumor on the internet says that

49
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:35,529
those campers were taken away
by jack-d-lantern...

50
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,100
<i>just beside the lake...</i>

51
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,642
beside the lake...

52
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,941
Stop. What's up?

53
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,209
What does that mean? I don't understand.

54
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,053
It's "Wandering"!

55
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,417
I don't understand.

56
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,986
You should write it more clearer,
stupid screenwriter!

57
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,096
Come on. Sun is almost set.

58
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:11,135
Start from "in the night".

59
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,339
Yes.

60
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,606
What the hell intelligent hostess!

61
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,503
What?

62
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,111
Nothing. Please keep this position.

63
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,078
Let's start, Mr. Yamada.

64
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,778
In the night,

65
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:37,123
jack-d-lantern was
wandering along the lake.

66
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:41,699
It's terrible, isn't it?
But I will do my best to find it out.

67
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:46,896
Here we go! Mini shirt Adventure.

68
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,975
Good... Excellent.

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,246
Good work. Let's move on.

70
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,076
It's stupid.

71
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:14,900
Can you see that?

72
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,899
Absolutely.

73
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,761
We are done here. How about you there?

74
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,896
Almost done!

75
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:45,993
Make it faster.

76
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,064
Got it.

77
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,802
Please get ready.

78
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:50,628
Ready...

79
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,701
Start.

80
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,110
Fog is getting heavier.

81
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,413
Look. Somethings there.

82
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:16,023
Is this belonged to the missing campers?

83
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:24,662
There. And there...

84
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:34,147
This... maybe...

85
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:41,745
Stop! It is ridiculous.

86
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,422
I did not make this.

87
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,554
Don't say anything useless.

88
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,758
I am sorry.

89
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,927
It is going to rain.

90
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:54,693
It's fine. Let's go to another scene.

91
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,062
I really did not make this...

92
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,262
Hurry up. Get all things ready.

93
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,901
Yes.

94
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:42,678
Stop! Okay.

95
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,008
Get off the water. Let's go.

96
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,017
Yes. I know.

97
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,793
Oh my...

98
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,435
What are you doing. Come on up.

99
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,784
Let's go.

100
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,785
This way. Keep quiet.

101
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,560
What are you doing here, Yohei?

102
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,398
Here is a house!

103
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,811
A house? This way.

104
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,024
What a bad day!

105
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,889
How is the camera?

106
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,638
Is it a hostel?

107
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:15,301
Welcome. You all are wet. Please come in.

108
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:51,103
It's just a rain shower.
I think it will stop soon.

109
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,537
Please have some hot soup to keep you warm.

110
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,815
I'm gonna get hot water
ready for you to shower.

111
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,550
Thank you.

112
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:15,586
It's potato soup. Enjoy!

113
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,794
I drink it first.

114
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,568
It's delicious.

115
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,637
Really?

116
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,847
It's warm.

117
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,054
What do you guys come here for? Fishing?

118
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,948
Filming.

119
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,121
A documentary about global protection.

120
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,830
Oh. I see...

121
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:55,763
We pay our whole effort
to protect the world.

122
00:13:56,102 --> 00:14:00,164
But some bad people
keep destroying the forest,

123
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,601
ruining the nature.

124
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,741
It's good to hear that.

125
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,245
The condition was turning bad
since I moved in.

126
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,179
The campers always made here dirty.

127
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:18,482
It was sad.

128
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:24,019
It is unforgivable.

129
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,326
Please keep it on!

130
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,194
Sure!

131
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,007
I think you should stay here tonight.

132
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,973
Yes.

133
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:44,840
Oh. I'm gonna get things ready.
Enjoy the soup.

134
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,757
She is beautiful.

135
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,129
Yes. She is really beautiful.

136
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,135
I don't ever think staying
here for the night.

137
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,934
We have no choice.
We did not take the day scene.

138
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,977
Big boss will kill us if
we would not finish it.

139
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,611
Let's take the night forest scene.

140
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,015
Have you brought with the lighting,
Mr. Yamada?

141
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,658
It did not have enough power.
You pick in the car.

142
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,196
Dry up Mamimi's clothes.
We will go after the rain.

143
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,626
Got it.

144
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,732
I don't agree. I never
ever heard about that.

145
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,403
Didn't hear about that?

146
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,101
This is your job. You should get it done.

147
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,772
This work will never finish

148
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,577
if you keeping on like this.

149
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,380
What is your mean?

150
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,583
The rain seems stopped.

151
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,626
Well, let's go.
Bring along the lighting equipments.

152
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,263
Yes.

153
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,763
Do you think the house's so weird,
Mr. Yamada?

154
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,664
Did you feel something?

155
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,171
No. But I think the lady is weird.

156
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:55,640
And the skull that we found was not my...

157
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,215
I know.
You watched so many low-class movies.

158
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,849
Let's have some drinks
and sleep after all done.

159
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,453
Yes.

160
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,313
Where is the director?

161
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,686
Director said you are responsible...

162
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,089
to film that bitch.

163
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,922
Really?

164
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,965
Please, director.

165
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,161
I said No.

166
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,966
How can I finish the job.

167
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,476
He did not mean that. He apologized to you.

168
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:32,310
So what?

169
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:36,044
He always challenge me.

170
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:41,422
This is what your job.

171
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:45,460
If this is what you think, I quit.

172
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,334
Don't ever say that.

173
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,115
How could it be. You can't do that.

174
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,524
Really?

175
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,391
Hayami.

176
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,696
What?

177
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,495
I think the job is awful too.

178
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:31,671
I want to do something big.

179
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,676
I won't do the job long.

180
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,613
Let's quit the job together.

181
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,424
I was responsible to this filming.

182
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,287
This was a social program.

183
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:57,161
That's why I recommended you
being the hostress.

184
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,495
Really?

185
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,368
I used my authority to do this.
You can't quit the job

186
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:10,548
...even thought you don't like it.

187
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:20,549
Let's go. Forget the bad things.

188
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,342
What do you think?

189
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:49,882
I can see the string.

190
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,453
Are you sure?

191
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,785
Swing it. Right.

192
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,061
Right side... right side. Yes.

193
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:06,734
Move to the right. That's right.

194
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:56,728
It's weird. I should be too tried.
Let's do it after the filming.

195
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,232
No.

196
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,771
Why?

197
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,773
I said no. I am leaving now.

198
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,507
What are you doing?

199
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,239
I am sorry. The string has broken.

200
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:16,887
Put it out.

201
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:24,993
Please calm down.

202
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,766
What you said about the new TV program
is a lie.

203
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,595
It is not a lie. Let's have it done.

204
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:41,644
Wait. We go find her.

205
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,075
Okay.

206
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,905
Mamimi...

207
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,677
Ms. Mamimi...

208
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:59,662
What a... You scared me.

209
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,367
I am sorry I scared you.

210
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,626
It's okay. No problem.

211
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,064
What happened here?

212
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,232
Nothing. They had a fight.

213
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,070
I am sorry about bothering you.

214
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,306
It's fine.

215
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,813
Here is no body except me.

216
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,217
Are you alright?

217
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:40,805
I'm alright.
Are you interested having a drink with me?

218
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,276
Because I can't sleep.

219
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,646
Okay.

220
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:11,632
Stop the car. Let me in.

221
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,564
What?

222
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,897
Please let me in.

223
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,771
Director. I found her.

224
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,947
Mamimi... open up.

225
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,343
I saw you on TV.

226
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:29,453
Please drive. I'll play with you later.

227
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,621
Really?

228
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:45,564
They are gone. It's hurt...

229
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,273
It was your fault.

230
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,442
It was not my business. It hurts...

231
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,144
What do you say? Isn't
it your responsibility?

232
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,577
I'm sorry.

233
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,973
It is quiet.

234
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,710
Yes. Abnormally quiet.

235
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,217
Don't you feel lonely?

236
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,954
What?

237
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:44,094
Being alone in this place.

238
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:56,571
I like living here by myself.

239
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:03,277
But sometime can't get sleep.

240
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,978
I see.

241
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:13,221
I was so sad being alone here.

242
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:23,727
So I keep waiting...

243
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,204
until you guys are here.

244
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,235
Comfortable?

245
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:16,036
It's embarrassing. Keep touching me.

246
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:18,525
Shit! What a stupid bitch.

247
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,707
What seems to be the problem?

248
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,211
Don't you know that?

249
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,545
Mr. Yamada is fooling around with the lady.

250
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:53,731
What are you doing? It's not good.

251
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,833
It's a real documentary.

252
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:07,705
Amazing. I like this music.

253
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:20,001
Don't stop. Keep on.

254
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:08,210
What a shame!

255
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,272
Who is the next?

256
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,385
Yohei!

257
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,018
What?

258
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,723
Don't tell anyone what you see today.

259
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,296
Yes.

260
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:22,486
UFO didn't show up finally.

261
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:27,291
But whether the legend is real or not.

262
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:35,193
Please watch Miniskirt Adventure next week.

263
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:47,702
Director. What do you think?

264
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,682
No problem.

265
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:57,385
This is all for today. Thank you all.

266
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,627
Mr. Yamada is still missing.

267
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,861
Yes.

268
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,259
What happened to him?

269
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,194
Weren't you all stay together?

270
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,636
Yes.

271
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,740
Yohei, you go back to office
picking up materials.

272
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,405
Okay.

273
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,500
What?

274
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,808
Nothing.

275
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,712
You look so tried recently.

276
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:58,207
Are you stressed on this new program?

277
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,246
Do you still mad at me?

278
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:13,326
I am very sorry.
I had a problem at that moment.

279
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:22,636
But today... can't be better.

280
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:28,064
Excellent.
I feel that I am extremely good today.

281
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,847
Do you want to do it again?

282
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,347
Yes?

283
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,592
No.

284
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:21,798
What?

285
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,033
It was not you.

286
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:54,829
What? Help... It hurts.

287
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,635
Stop it.

288
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,681
What are you doing here?

289
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,327
Nothing. I am sorry.

290
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:14,326
Let's go.

291
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,604
Okay.

292
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,296
Your driving is awful.

293
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,033
I am sorry.

294
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:33,911
You are here.

295
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:38,986
I have been waiting for you.

296
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:46,692
Take it.

297
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,056
Okay.

298
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,730
I am missing you.

299
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:20,156
You are the next one.

300
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:39,380
No.

301
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:46,077
Stop. Stand still.

302
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:51,916
Okay. Come on up.

303
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,287
Dreaming.

304
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,898
What are you doing? Come on.
The sun is almost set.

305
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:15,305
Coming.

306
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,597
The arrangement is so bad.

307
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,727
I am sorry.

308
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,409
How stupid you are!

309
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:56,084
Let's go.

310
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:59,107
I'm a woman who want to suck sperm
and desire...

311
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:02,883
to maintain my life.

312
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:59,336
Love your evil.
