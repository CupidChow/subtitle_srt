00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,740
my boss.

187
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,550
All right.

188
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,900
You are the first one to sincerely

189
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,650
appreciate my music.

190
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,770
We became a one-and-only pair

191
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,940
working towards a common dream.

192
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,610
-Hey, we're late.
-Okay, let's go.

193
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,340
Get off quickly.

194
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,300
-Go in first.
-I'll go in first.

195
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,830
Okay, go in first.

196
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,390
I'm sorry, everyone.

197
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,340
Hello, everyone.

198
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,870
The part-timer is always late.

199
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,070
Because you're always late,

200
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,500
Baram is always late too.

201
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,840
Youngmi, you look good today.

202
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,020
That's Youngmi's charm.

203
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,490
I know.

204
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,910
My number one pick.

205
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,400
Take care of your real number one pick

206
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,020
instead of me.

207
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,890
What's wrong with Baram?

208
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,930
My singer is doing well.

209
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,940
He's nervous right now.

210
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,430
Hey, Han Baram.

211
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,150
Stick your chest out!

212
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,060
-Stick your chest out.
-Raise your head.

213
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,290
Raise your head like this.

214
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,390
Look ahead.

215
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,070
Oh, that's good.

216
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,960
Good. That's it.

217
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,280
Hurry and go back to work,

218
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,410
or I won't pay you.

219
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,240
Ah...

220
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,980
Okay.

221
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,280
I'll get going.

222
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,480
-Shall we start?
-Okay.

223
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,580
-Let's try...
-Fighting!

224
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,260
It's so cold.

225
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm sorry, everyone.

226
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,730
A lot of you came. It was cold on the way here, wasn't it?

227
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,800
Today, we'll turn this cold winter air

228
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,660
into a warm spring wind, and warm everyone up.

229
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,010
If you're moved by the performance,

230
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,220
don't forget to follow and like our Instagram.

231
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,580
Let me introduce

232
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,840
the sentimental band,

233
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,370
Chasing Wind.

234
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,100
Hello, everyone. We are Chasing Wind.

235
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,140
We're going to sing the song we prepared for you today.

236
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,820
♫Cold days, cold memories♫

237
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,320
♫Cold tears, cold memories♫

238
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,340
♫Those don't suit spring♫

239
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,630
♫Warm hands, warm memories♫

240
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,710
♫Warm looks, warm hugs♫

241
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:28,440
♫Those suit me better♫

242
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,330
♫The only one♫

243
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,300
I don't have an apartment with a Han River view,

244
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,860
or a building at Cheongdam-dong.

245
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,160
But I have

246
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,610
precious friends by my side.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,820
I'm...

248
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,240
still working towards my dream.

249
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,090
Thank you for coming to our performance today.

250
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,660
One, two, three.

251
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,690
Encore. Encore. Encore.

252
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,630
Sing us a love song.

253
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,360
Woo!

254
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,630
Wow, a love song.

255
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,060
Do you have a really romantic one?

256
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,610
It's our first anniversary performing here.

257
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,270
It'll be a pity if it ends like this.

258
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,230
Sing that song.

259
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,690
Letter of Apology.

260
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,350
Here, sit here.

261
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,710
Then...

262
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,740
I wrote this song a long time ago.

263
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,690
I'll sing it for you now.

264
00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:01,970
♫It's as if the whole world stopped♫

265
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,760
♫The moment I look at you♫

266
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,700
♫Something I can't reach♫

267
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:21,450
♫Like a small satellite, always spinning around you♫

268
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,180
♫Woo♫

269
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,770
♫In my heart filled with starlight♫

270
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:45,240
♫Woo♫

271
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,290
♫Spreading clearly and filling up my night♫

272
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,790
I'll stop here.

273
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay.

274
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,800
-This is your salary for today's performance.
-Yay.

275
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,740
Mine too. Mine too.

276
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,240
Yay!

277
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,140
I envy Youngmi the most in this world.

278
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,230
She's in a band,

279
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,150
a shop owner,

280
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,410
and she does everything she wants.

281
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,870
I really envy you.

282
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,370
I

283
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,960
envy myself sometimes too.

284
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,590
Thanks to the enviable Youngmi,

285
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,320
we have regular jobs here.

286
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,820
I'm really grateful to Youngmi.

287
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,060
Thank you for your hard work today, everyone.

288
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,520
-Let's work hard tomorrow too.
-Okay.
-Okay.

289
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,540
Let's say our slogan.

290
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,390
Hurry up.

291
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,010
You do it.

292
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,600
Chase along...

293
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,480
And sing...

294
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,730
The wind's...

295
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,630
Song!

296
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,400
Let's go.

297
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,060
Hey, Han Baram.

298
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,300
You didn't finish that song again.

299
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,750
Why do you leave me hanging?

300
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,510
I'll do as I please.

301
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,240
-Why?
-Wait.

302
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,690
Do you know this song too?

303
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,900
Gosh.

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,530
I suddenly feel so left out.

305
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,780
You should've told us if he has a good song.

306
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,950
I know right, you two are the only ones who know.

307
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,770
I really feel so left out.

308
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,300
Hey, let's go for a second round of drinks.

309
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,010
Hey.

310
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,510
How do we go for a second round when we haven't even had the first round?

311
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,610
I saw you hiding and drinking

312
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,110
in the corner just now.

313
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,640
You always drink by yourself.

314
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,680
That's...

315
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,800
because I was nervous, so I just had a sip to calm my nerves.

316
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,620
If people overheard this, they might misunderstand that I always perform drunk.

317
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,430
Are you two not going to go home

318
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,480
and just going to keep on bickering?

319
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,840
I have plans early tomorrow morning.

320
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,110
So I don't care if you're going for the first or second round of drinks.

321
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,540
Have fun yourselves.

322
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,790
-Bye. Yeah?
-Youngmi.

323
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,570
Do you... want me to take you home?

324
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,410
Sure. You'll pay for the taxi.

325
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,940
Hey.

326
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,110
Isn't today your first anniversary performing together?

327
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,610
Don't you want to hang out together?

328
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,400
The first anniversary is next week.

329
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,400
Jungpal got it wrong.

330
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,550
You two are really alike.

331
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,250
Oh, right. Baram.

332
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,150
You're going to check out practice rooms tomorrow, right?

333
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,500
-Anyway, see you tomorrow. Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

334
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,660
Okay. Bye...

335
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,260
Bye.

336
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,670
It's next week?

337
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,850
I didn't know either.

338
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,620
Let's pack up and go.

339
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,320
Okay.

340
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,340
I'm almost done.

341
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,970
Gosh.

342
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,410
Where did he go?

343
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,760
You went overboard again,

344
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,520
when your alcohol tolerance is just two cans.

345
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,350
I also bought your portion, you hard drinker.

346
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,320
I do like beer quite a bit.

347
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,950
Take it. Your bonus.

348
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,850
There's no boss like me.

349
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,460
Put it away, Mr. Im Hantae.

350
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,890
Consider it as rent.

351
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,590
Even though I'm not very perceptive,

352
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,090
I still have a conscience.

353
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,810
Did I ask you to come live with me?

354
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,390
You just packed your stuff and moved in.

355
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,950
Then should I move out?

356
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,750
I don't like the pink walls anyway.

357
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,130
I should move out.

358
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,760
You don't even mean that.

359
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,000
It's cold.

360
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,460
Shall we go?

361
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,020
Come, sit in the back.

362
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,150
Come on.

363
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,850
But can you really finish all of these?

364
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,510
I'm sure you can.

365
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,830
Do you think I'm a drunkard?

366
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,280
Come on. One, two, three.

367
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:09,860
[Contract]

368
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,240
[Today's person on duty!]
Vacuum.
Do the laundry. Hang the clothes to dry.
Do the dishes.
Throw away the recyclable trash
Hantae, do it all by yourself ^^*]

369
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,890
Hey, stop drinking.

370
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,440
You've drank more than two cans.

371
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,980
Something Baram likes.

372
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,420
This one too.

373
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,480
Something that Baram likes. This one too.

374
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,480
This is also something Baram likes.

375
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,140
Hehe. A heart.

376
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,140
Han Baram.

377
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,180
Hey, Han Baram!

378
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,050
What's the matter?

379
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,550
I...

380
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,720
love you. You know that right?

381
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,210
I can't make you debut yet,

382
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,000
but to me,

383
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,350
you're already an international superstar.

384
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,850
Yeah?

385
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,400
You know that, right?

386
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,850
Hey, you're drunk. Stop drinking.

387
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,210
No, I'm not drunk.

388
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,500
Anyway,

389
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,940
I really really really really like you, Baram.

390
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,940
When I first saw you,

391
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,710
I already felt it deep in my heart.

392
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,670
You too, right?

393
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,010
No.

394
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,370
I really hated you.

395
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,570
What about now?

396
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,960
You like me now, right?

397
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,270
I'm the best, right? Best of the best, right?

398
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,570
Come on. Tell me what I am to you.

399
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,180
-Sigh.
-Goodness.

400
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,320
Im Hantae.

401
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,000
I like you.

402
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,380
Happy?

403
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,370
-Really?
-It's a lie.

404
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,270
Gosh, you're doing it again.

405
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,110
You're messing with me again.

406
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,060
Hey.

407
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,240
Han Baram.

408
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,560
Darn it.

409
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,280
I've done this much.

410
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,270
Can't you just like me once?

411
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,710
Can't you?

412
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,750
Hey.

413
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,810
You give my name to a random doll.

414
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,600
Do you think I'll like you when you're like that?

415
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,850
Hey. You call this doll Im Hantae too.

416
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,250
I saw everything.

417
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,610
About you...

418
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,160
I know everything.

419
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,740
Because you can't escape from the palm of my hand.

420
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,390
It's late. Let's go to sleep.

421
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,740
I have to leave early tomorrow morning.

422
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,760
I'll just have one last one.

423
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,810
No.

424
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,270
-Just one can. Just one more.
-No.

425
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,100
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

426
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,580
Hey.

427
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,230
Let's take a photo.

428
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,210
All of a sudden?

429
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,280
Come here.

430
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,050
Today's TMI.

431
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,230
The fans are waiting.

432
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,310
Here.

433
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,650
Promise you'll go to sleep after taking this photo.

434
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,510
Okay. I promise.

435
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,110
Here.

436
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,620
Here. One...

437
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,850
Two, come here.

438
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,890
Three!

439
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,320
-Hey, Im Hantae!
-I'm going to wash up first.

440
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,150
Do you want to join me?

441
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,430
You're so clueless.

442
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
I don't know since when,

443
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,110
but I've fallen for you.

444
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,170
Huh?

445
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,080
They're Bluewin, an idol group that debuted last week.

446
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,760
Isn't this your song?

447
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,980
Bluewin?

448
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,740
Huh?

449
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,260
It's Mr. Sangin.

450
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,130
I wrote this song, Letter of Apology,

451
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,830
while thinking of you.
