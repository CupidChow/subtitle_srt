You're acting really suspiciously.

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,580
Didn't you suddenly

I see.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,010
It must be an amazing person.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,390

20

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,190
Sexy, pure,

28

Well, I'm not sure about sexy for now.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,830
But why would someone like that like you?

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,390
Hey.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
What's wrong with me?

32
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm quite good-looking,

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,759
Then what's there to worry about?

37
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,500
Just make your move.

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,850
How far have you progressed with him?

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,390
I'm asking you how far you have progressed with him.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,470
Actually, I...

41
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,949
I received a confession from him.

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,410
You received a confession from him?

43
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,370
Wow, that's interesting. And then?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,220
He took it back,

45
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,520
not long after.

46
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,320
Why?

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,860

48

I don't know.

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,030
I don't understand. It's so confusing.

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,020
It does sound confusing.

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,560
I agree.

52
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,680
Hmm.

53
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,140

54

What about me?

55
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,020
Don't feign ignorance. I'm talking about you and Jungpal.

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh, that?

57
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,090
I was just

58

59
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,010

61
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,290
Really?

62
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,980
Then

63
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,410
I should tell him I want to be in a relationship with him later.

64
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,390
Is it that easy for you?

65
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,550
What's so hard about it for you?

66
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,760

134
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,230

What's going on?

136

From now on, let's not just do our laundry separately,

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,059
but do everything else separately too.

138
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,610
I'll use the bottom section of the fridge.

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,170

146
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,900
Let's just do it that way.

147
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,600
Okay?

148
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,210
Okay. Got it.

149
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,450
It's good. It reminds me of my school lunch.

150
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,640
Hey, Han Baram.

151
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,980
Doesn't the term housemate

152
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,750
refer to strangers?

153
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,680
They live together, but don't eat together

154
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,550
or greet each other.

155
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,560
They aren't even aware if the other's at home or not.

156
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,790
They're complete strangers!

157
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,610
Does it mean that from now on,

158
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,030
we can't even drink beer together?

159
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,110
Are you really going to draw a line between us like this?

160
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,810
Am I the one who drew the line first?

161
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,330
What do you mean?

162
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,450
Forget it. Let's stop here.

163

175
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,030

179
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,960
It's none of my business.

180
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,290
I'm going to buy some drinks. What do you want?

181
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,500
I want an iced vanilla latte.

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,360
Me too.

183
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,950
You're going to your part-time job, right?

184
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,610

Hantae.

188
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,170

Can I really go on a blind date?

196

Why do you care about how I feel?

197
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,040
Because I feel uneasy.

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,690
You're right.

The tempo feels heavy. Again.

378
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,700
Come on.

379
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,130
Baram.

380
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,380
Why? What's wrong?

381
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,950
Gosh.

382
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,010
Team Leader.

383
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,220
I'm sorry,

384
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,690
but I need to go inside.

385
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,090
Go ahead.

386
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,340
I'm sorry.

387
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,690
What now?

388
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,730
This is not the right vibe.

389
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,350
What vibe?

390
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,310
Focus again and get a good take.

391
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,290
Okay.

392
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,830
You can do it.

393
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,630
-Team Leader, thank you for your hard work.
-Okay.

394
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,600
-Bye.
-Have a safe trip.

395
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,740
-Okay. See you next time.
-Okay. Bye.

396
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,220
Hantae.

397
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,240
You know how rude you were just now, right?

398
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,660
You were making us so uneasy.

399
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,610
I was too ambitious. I'm sorry.

400
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,980
That's why

401
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,160
I thought it was better.

402
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,060
Right?

403
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,900
Anyway, our first recording ended smoothly.

404
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,490
Let's go celebrate.

405
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,750
My treat.

406
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,530
No, thanks.

407
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,330
Jungpal and I are going on a date,

408
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,580
so you two can enjoy yourselves.

409
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,180
Bye.

410
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,270
Bye.

411
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,260
You'll join me, right?

412
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Baram, I'm sorry.

413
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,960
What was that?

414
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,530
When you sang Letter of Apology,

415
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,940
who were you thinking about?

416
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,180
Tell me the truth.

417
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,110
Who else could I've been thinking about?

418
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,700
Don't tell me you are...

419
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,590
Yes, I was jealous.

420
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,640
The way you played the guitar sounded just like that.

421
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,810
Am I wrong?

422
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,550
What? I wasn't thinking about anyone.

423
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,020
So you didn't think about me either?

424
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,700
From now on,

425
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,120
you must sing with my vibe.

426
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,380
Got it?

427
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,840
Your vibe?

428
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,530
I don't know what that is.

429
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,920
You don't?

430
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,080
Should we take a step further?

431
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,640
Im Hantae, you're really...

432
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,320
What were you thinking?

433
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't know.

434
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,120
Gosh.

435
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,810
-Kiss.
-Hey.

436
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,910
Fine.

437
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,240
Think about me next time you sing it.

438
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,930
I'll think about it.

441
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,840
When are you going to say it to me?

442
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,590
-Say what?
-To start dating.

443
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,740
Do I have to say it?

444
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,000
One, two, three.

445
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,950
