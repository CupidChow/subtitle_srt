I'll tell you when I need help.

189
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,040
Okay.

190
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,010
Bye.

191
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,190
Gosh.

192
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,780
Why are you two fighting?

193
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,350
Where are you going?

194
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,900
Do I have to tell you that?

195
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,130
Seriously you...

196
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,270
Aren't you going to stop me?

197
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,010
-Mom! Mom! -What's...

198
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,560
You didn't even contact me...

199
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,640
No...

200
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,370
What's going on?

201
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,900
My goodness.

202
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,470
Notice regarding band Chasing Wind

203
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,660
I, Im Hantae,

204
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,030
as the band Chasing Wind's person-in-charge....

205
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,880
Mom!

206
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,200
Gosh. Hey!

207
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,430
I'm leaving.

208
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,340
Wait.

209
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,470
Hey.

210
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,030
What happened? You just came back and you're leaving?

211
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,270
What's with that statement?

212
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,820
Tell me.

213
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,100
What are you doing?

214
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,100
I'll tell you later. I gotta go.

215
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,920
Forget it.

216
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,970
Eat before you go.

217
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,130
Come here.

218
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,180
How many days have you been hungry?

219
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,970
Slow down.

220
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,600
I made your favorite bulgogi.

221
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,450
Eat this.

222
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,930
Eat slowly and chew it.

223
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
By the way, how's Baram?

224
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,630
No, he's not.

225
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,900
So I'm going to let him to live a good life.

226
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,070
Mind your own business.

227
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,810
-Mom, this was really good. -Okay.

228
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,660
I have to go.

229
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,650
Hey, don't you need this?

230
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,440
What?

231
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,560
Isn't this your old phone?
Why are you using it?

232
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,620
This phone contains important evidence.

233
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,400
Mom, I'm leaving. I'll visit you on the weekend.

234
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,350
Goodness.

235
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,660
Hey.

236
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,460
Do you know

237
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,660
how hard it is to live with someone you like?

238
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,040
He strips naked every day,

239
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,700
hug me and kiss me as if it's nothing.

240
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,590
Also...

241
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,900
He keeps smiling at me.

242
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,150
It makes my heart flutter.

243
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,360
Friendship gift.

244
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,370
What is this?

245
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,220
This is you.

246
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,620
Isn't it cute?

247
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,100
Yes, it is quite cte.

248
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,500
Thank you.

249
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,670
Baram.

250
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,680
Meow.

251
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,870
Why is it called Baram?

252
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,240
It looks like you.

253
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,830
Her eyes are round.

254
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,450
Doesn't it look like me too?

255
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,310
I like you.

256
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,340
So...

257
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,500
I couldn't tell you.

258
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,810
He drank alone again.

259
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,270
"The tip of the bean sprouts..."

260
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,470
You're awake?

261
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,710
When did you get here?

262
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,180
Just now.

263
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,760
What's wrong with this bean sprout? I bought them at the place I used to buy them from.

264
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,520
Oh.

265
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,430
I haven't taken care of it yet.

266
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,320
Damn it, the root is entangled again.

267
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,120
I should've bought something chopped up already.

268
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
I should've let you eat something delicious.

269
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,580
Why?

270
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,680
Were you bored without me?

271
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,060
You were bored, weren't you?

272
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,130
No?

273
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,840
No.

274
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,970
I was really comfortable.

275
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,460
Your eyes are swollen.

276
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,040
Aren't you crying because I'm not here?

277
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm almost done.

278
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,840
Go have a seat over there.

279
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,280
Tadah.

280
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,390
Isn't this

281
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,020
the phone you used before?

282
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,890
Wait.

283
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,380
A gift.

284
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,310
Wow.

285
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,860
Look at this fluffy hair.

286
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,620
You were just a kid, Mr. Han Baram.

287
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,530
You have that side too.

288
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,180
When did you take this?

289
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,580
You have to film my favorite singer.

290
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,970
Isn't it a good memory?

291
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,550
The soup is boiling.

292
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,390
That's quick.

293
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,250

295
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,860
I'll upload this

296

297
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,940
and send email to the reporters.

298
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,610
I did well, right?

299
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,690
Hey, Im Hantae.

300
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,750
What?

301
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,840
If we strike first, the problem will be solved.

302
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
I told you not to do anything.

303
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,620
Hey.

304
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,070
Don’t you feel sorry for your song?

305
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,900
Aren't you angry?

306
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,710
I can't stand it anymore.

307
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,470
I can't watch you being a tool.

308
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,600
I said I'll take care of it.

309
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,950
Why don't you trust me?

310
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,040
Causing this entire situation?

311
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,920
I was so frustrated.

312
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,460
So frustrated I thought I was going to die?

313
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,380
What's your weakness?

314
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,520
What made you so quiet?

315
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,480
Pull yourself together, Han Baram.

316
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,300
Jin Sangin is using you.

317
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,860
Why are you being manipulated like a fool?

318
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,630
Im Hantae.

319
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,420
The weakness that you want to know so bad...

320
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,110
I will tell you about it.

321
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,720
I liked Mr. Jin Sangin.

322
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,880
He was my first love.

323
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,980
"Letter of Apology" was also...

324
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,990
a song I wrote thinking about him.

325
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,540
So...

326
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,680
I wanted to pretend that it's nothing and let it go.

327
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,970
So I held back even though I knew I was being used.

328
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,900
But you...

329
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,860
You ruined everything.

330
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,070
♫I'm walking among the stars that is you♫

331
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:31,000
♫I got lost because of the dazzling light♫

332
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,920
What are you doing?

333
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,260
Are you fooling with me?

334
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,640
You said you needed time.

335
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,310
You asked me to give you time?

336
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,770
Are we disbanding now?

337
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,280
Yongmi, will we never see each other again?

338
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,250
I believe in Baram.

339
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,150
So let's...

340
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,430
give him some time.

341
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,010
I'm not okay.

342
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,210
I'm so scared.
