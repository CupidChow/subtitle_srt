Are we disbanding now?

189
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,030
Youngmi, will we never see each other again?

190
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,430
Do you...

191
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,420
really think Baram is that kind of person?

192
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,960
No... but...

193
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,200
But that's how the situation is like now.

194
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,320
Hey.

195
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,420
This is not the time for us to mope. Let's confront them.

196
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,940
Hantae, lead us. Let's go.

197
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,870
I won't let Han Baram go.

198
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,450
So, guys...

199
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,920
Don't worry.

200
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,400
I trust Baram.

201
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,410
So let's...

202
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,580
give him some time.

203
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay?

204
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,070
Baram.

205
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,630
Hey, Han Baram.

206
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,170
I'm going in.

207
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,230
Hey.

208
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,180
Han Baram.

209
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,170
Get up.

210
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,500
I want to be alone.

211
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,020
Dress warmly and come out.

212
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,400
I'll wait for you at the door.

213
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,510
Don't wait for me.

214
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,850
Listen to me.

215
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,940
Get on the bike.

216
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,920
Get on!

217
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,920
Hold on tight, so that you won't fall off.

218
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,930
Lean on me.

219
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,330
Where are we going?

220
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,660
If you're curious, pay me 500 won.

221
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,060
What are we doing here?

222
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,640
You're so cute.

223
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,140
Come up.

224
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,690
I don't know how to box.

225
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,350
Just do it however you can.

226
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,400
What's there to worry about?

227
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,300
Come up.

228
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,910
Punch it.

229
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,430
Punch like this.

230
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,160
Got it?

231
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,310
Punch harder.

232
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,550
I told you to punch harder!

233
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,350
Stand up.

234
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,960
Stand up and punch!

235
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,510
This is Jin Sangin.

236
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,900
This is me.

237
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,800
Think like that and punch.

238
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,920
It's okay. I punch while imagining you're the target all the time.

239
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,660
You don't have to feel guilty.

240
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,080
Hurry up!

241
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,600
That's it.

242
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,190
Okay.

243
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,000
Good. One more time.

244
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,540
One, two!

245
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,040
You're so good at it.

246
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,610
Why are you afraid?

247
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,900
Right?

248
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,830
Why are you scared? Again!

249
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,700
Okay!

250
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,240
One last time!

251
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,100
Have you vented thoroughly?

252
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,210
Take it off.

253
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,440
It's my turn.

254
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:52,980
Put this on.

255
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,930
Raise your hands.

256
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,270
Are you ready?

257
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,720
Yes.

258
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,570
You really...

If you go to Highcode Entertainment,

260
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,070
what would become of our band?

261
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,340
What about our dream? What about me?

262
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,040
You're so bad. How could you have confessed

263
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,430
in that way?

264
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,360
That's why you got dumped.

265
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,980
Why is it so tiring to like someone?

266
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,600
What did I do wrong?

267
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,030
But you were so bad and hit me so hard just now.

268
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,420
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,440
Darn it.

270
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,390
I'm sorry.

271
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,760
You didn't do anything wrong.

272
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,320
It's okay.

273
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,980
Why are you crying?

274
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,320
I don't know.

275
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,500
You hit me too hard.

276
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,850
That's why I'm crying.

277
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,660
I won't cry.

Han Baram.

283
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,700
Let go.

284
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,230
If you're drunk, go home.

285
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,730
I think you can't live without me now.

286
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,250
To be honest...
