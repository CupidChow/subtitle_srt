Isn't that what first love is like?

190
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,180
Affectionate and pure.

191
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,650
Just like us, Bluewin.

192
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,950
I wrote this song, Letter of Apology,

193
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,880
while thinking of you.

194
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,550
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave a message...

195
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,610
Oh?

196
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,870
Baram?

197
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,950
Baram.

198
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,560
Why are you still standing here in the cold?

199
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,300
Where have you been?

200
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,100
You're like a fool.

201
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,370
Hello, Sir.

202
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,370
Hello, you've been hard at work.

203
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,080
Hey.

204
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,770
By the way, what's going on with this?

205
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,360
[Bluewin's Letter of Apology is very similar to this song]

206
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,650
What's going on?

207
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,810
I...

208
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,000
Well...

209
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,830
Tell me the truth before the situation gets bigger.

210
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,600
Hah.

211
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,670
Don't worry.

212
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,300
I know him.

213
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,800
You know how typical this is.

214
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,870
Someone who wants to tear us down because of jealousy.

215
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,100
Then

216
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,250
you don't need the company to deal with this, do you?

217
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,850
The online post was deleted as soon as it was uploaded.

218
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,190
Take care of it. Don't let any news of it leak out.

219
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes.

220
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,850
Please trust me.

221
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,060
The song is rising rapidly

222
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,500
on the charts.

223
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,310
You know that, right?

224
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,640
Yes.

225
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,480
It'll be a disaster if the reporters catch wind of this.

226
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,450
I'll take care of it.

227
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,690
Okay.

228
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,950
Our CEO is here.

229
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,280
Let's show him what we practiced.

230
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,670
Play the song Letter of Apology.

231
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,340
We agreed not to keep secrets from each other.

232
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,470
Let's talk about it later.

233
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,430
I have to go for practice now.

234
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,570
That video...

235
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,130
What's going on?

236
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,600
And that Redwin or Bluewin?

237
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,570
They plagiarized your song.

238
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,850
Aren’t you upset because of that?

239
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,300
Well...

240
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,730
It might just be a coincidence.

241
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,940
What coincidence?

242
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,640
Hey.

243
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,240
That's your song.

244
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,380
Nobody knows my song.

245
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,020
The song doesn't belong to anyone.

246
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,470
No one knows?

247
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,540
I've heard of it.

248
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,240
I heard it clearly with my two ears.

249
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,570
I don't want to do anything about it.

250
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
-So...
-Why?

251
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,870
Why?

252
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,570
I'm late.

253
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,190
Wait.

254
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,760
You coughed all night.

255
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,220
Go on.

256
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,050
I'll be back soon.

257
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,830
Have a good practice session.

258
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,120
Gosh.

259
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,000
It's so frustrating. Han Baram... come on.

260
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,630
Thank you.

261
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,110
Thank you.

262
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,250
Baram, are you up to it?

263
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,950
Yes.

264
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,020
Let me see.

265
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,670
You have a fever.

266
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,230
Let's call off the performance today.

267
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,390
No, I want to perform.

268
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,050
Bear with it for a little.

269
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,850
Hello, we are Chasing Wind.

270
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,740
Today is the song request day.

271
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,240
We'll sing your requested songs

272
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,190
for you.

273
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,690
If you want to listen to any song,

274
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,640
please request it.

Letter of Apology.

277
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,920
With that song, I...

278
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,260
You sang it here last time.

279
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,300
Sing it again.

280
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,340
Baram!

281
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,920
Are you okay?

282
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,480
Are you okay?

283
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,870
What should we do?

284
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,540
That's why I told you to call off the performance.

285
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,220
You're so stubborn.

286
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,360
Han Baram.

287
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,900
Who are you?

288
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,820
Long time no see.

289
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,000
Mr. Sangin?

290
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,780
What brings you here?

291
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,350
To see Baram.

292
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,760
Were you so close before?

293
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,660
What are you talking about?

294
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,180
Get to the point.

295
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,830
I'm not looking for you, but Baram.

296
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,400
Can't you see he's sick?

297
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,850
It's because you stole his song.

298
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,790
Hantae.

299
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,150
Wait.

300
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,850
Let me deal with this.

301
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,450
This is my business.

302
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,860
This is between us.

303
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,270
I'll contact you some time later.

304
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,390
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

305
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,070
Fine, Baram.

306
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,250
Let's meet and talk alone.

307
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,570
Because

308
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,310
it's something between you and me.

309
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,660
Oh, right.

310
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,940
Here.

311
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,840
My phone number.

312
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,680
The number hasn't changed,

313
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,660
but I was afraid you might have deleted it.

314
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,720
Let's meet up soon.

315
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,360
It'd be better if we can meet tomorrow. I'm very busy.

316
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:44,880
Have a seat.

317
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,470
Are you okay?

318
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,610
I want to go home.

319
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,900
Okay, I'll be right back. Stay here for a while.

Do you want to make a business card too?

A flashy one.

Hey.

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,650
What's with your attitude?

329
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,210
Why are you like that to someone

330
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,570
who is eager to help you?

331
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,430
Did I ask you for your help?

332
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,270
Well...

333
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,180

334
