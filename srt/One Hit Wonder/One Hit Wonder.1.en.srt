1
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:24,816
<i>And I don't wanna go on pretending </i>

2
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,989
<i>That it's gonna be a happy ending </i>

3
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,659
<i>If I should love again </i>

4
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>Once I've learned to love again </i>

5
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,061
- Mom.
- Hey, what is it?

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,854
Have you seen my bracelet?

7
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,232
Which bracelet?

8
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,152
The one I always wear.

9
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,820
The one from Dad.

10
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,240
I'll take a look.

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,996
Oh.

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:27,003
I think we left it back home.
Don't worry. We'll find it later, okay?

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,839
Mm-hmm.

14
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,467
Chona Velasquez?

15
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,095
- You're up, Chona. Don't be nervous.
- Okay, Dad.

16
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,888
- Break a leg.
- This way, please.

17
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>In your eyes</i>
<i>I can see my dream's reflections </i>

18
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:56,574
<i>In your eyes</i>
<i>Found the answers to my questions </i>

19
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,453
<i>In your eyes </i>

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>I can see the reasons why</i>
<i>Our love's alive… </i>

21
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,253
Lorina Dominguez.

22
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,713
- Over here.
- You're on next. Please stand by.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,801
<i>We're drifting safely back to shore </i>

24
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:21,099
<i>I think I've finally learned</i>
<i>To love you more </i>

25
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,893
- Who have we got next?
- Okay, everyone.

26
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,480
Up next we have Miss Lorina Dominguez!

27
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,734
Okay. Over here.

28
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,736
Director.

29
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,363
Here.

30
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,231
Director, what do we do? Should we cut?

31
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,734
- What is going on?
- I don't know. Hm?

32
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,321
Cut her off.

33
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,822
All right, on my signal, cut.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,828
There go the lights.

35
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:28,041
We apologize. We're experiencing
technical difficulties.

36
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:39,135
I'm pleased to announce
the winner of <i>The Next Champion</i>

37
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,429
is the one and only

38
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,432
- Chona Velasquez!
- Chona Velasquez!

39
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,726
Excuse me.

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,314
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Chona!

41
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,858
She was fantastic, wasn't she?

42
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,070
- Chona! Chona! Chona!
- Way to go, Chona!

43
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,530
Hey, I'll go grab our stuff, okay?

44
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,657
Mm-hmm.

45
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,161
What a performance
from Chona Velasquez, a worthy champion!

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,872
She really has the voice
of an angel, doesn't she?

47
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,794
<i>I just wish That he will love you too</i>

48
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:17,548
<i>I won't get my hopes up again </i>

49
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,883
<i>If you come back</i>…

50
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>Listen Without Prejudice</i>.

51
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,304
- <i>Listen Without Prejudice</i>?
- That's the title of the album.

52
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,806
See if they have it.

53
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,849
- Is this it?
- What?

54
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,978
- Oh, there it is.
- Where?

55
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,981
Uh, hey there. Excuse me, miss.

56
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,358
Are you gonna buy that?

57
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,860
Uh, no. Actually, I work here.

58
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,280
Ah, I thought you were a customer.

59
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,990
- Did you want it?
- Is that all right?

60
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:46,077
- Here. Do you need anything else?
- Oh. That's okay. This was it. Thank you.

61
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,912
- The cashier's over there.
- Okay.

62
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:52,292
Good thing she changed her name
from Chona Velasquez to Regine Velasquez.

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,586
- I know. Regine Regine!
- Isn't she absolutely gorgeous?

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,171
- Lorinski, come here.
- Sir?

65
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,632
- She's incredible.
- The best! Oh!

66
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm a huge fan!

67
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,553
What do you think you're doing?
Get back to your section.

68
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,307
I was just restocking the tapes.
I even made a sale.

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,976
Huh. Good initiative.

70
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,700
Hm.

71
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,666
Is there really no other option
but to work overseas?

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,795
They're going to repossess our place,

73
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,673
and Emil left behind a lot of debt.

74
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,386
It's the only way. I have no other choice.

75
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,681
You'd be an illegal immigrant.

76
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,893
It's too much of a risk.

77
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,771
People do it every day.

78
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,149
I wish that I was rich,

79
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,110
so I could handle it.

80
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,154
But…

81
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,116
We have nothing.
Nothing from Lyn-Lyn's dad.

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,620
He won't give us anything, not one cent.

83
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,874
But I'll do all that I can.

84
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,960
Don't worry about me.

85
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,923
I'll make it through for my daughter.

86
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,158
All right, all aboard. SM North.

87
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,163
Here's my payment.

88
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:03,423
<i>…eyes</i>
<i>Found the answers to my questions </i>

94
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,573
And… cut!
Good take. Let's get the next shot.

95
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,825
- Okay, Jocelyn, you stay there.
- Okay. Sure.

96
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,243
We're gonna get another angle.

97
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,371
- Yes, director. Just a quick changeover.
- Lyn, I'll be over there. All right?

98
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
Stand by, everyone.

99
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,879
Give me the camera.

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,131
Hey, cousin?

101
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,844
- Lyn-Lyn!
- You ready?

102
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,346
- Sorry, I fell asleep.
- That's okay.

103
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,056
Let's go.

104
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,281
- Yeah, that's right.
- Excuse me, sir.

105
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,089
<i>Don't judge me</i>
<i>On the music that I'm making </i>

106
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,050

<i>Then you didn't hear this song </i>

110
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,226
<i>This world is all mixed up </i>

111
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,312
<i>There's something going on </i>

112
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,397
<i>We better fix it up </i>

113
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,690
<i>Clean it up </i>

114
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,739
<i>'Cause it's hard to love again </i>

115
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,582
Who was that?

116
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,756
There you are. What are you doing up here?

117
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,927
Huh? We've all been waiting for you.

118
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,014
Uh, nothing, Dad.
What's over there in that building?

119
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,559
There was someone singing. She was great.

120
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,145
Maybe an entrant for <i>The Next Champion</i>.

121
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,730
Oh.

122
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,816
She could win it.

123
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,025
Who's that?

124
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,735
The girl who was singing.

125
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,488
Come on, let's go home.

126
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,864
Entoy, listen.

127
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,701
There's work to be done,
and you're up here?

128
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,620
Quit fooling around. Come on.

129
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,748
- Are you coming?
- All right, I'm coming.

130
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,210
- I'll take those.
- Good evening.

131
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,254
- Where're you going? We're about to eat.
- Hi.

132
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,173
- Hey.
- Dad, wait. I need to check something.

133
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,136
Hey, do that later. Come and have dinner.

134
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,596
Just give me a sec.

135
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,556
Hurry up, we're eating.

136
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,943
CHONA VELASQUEZ
THE NEXT CHAMPION '84

137
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,158
<i>Found the answers to my questions </i>

138
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,035
<i>In your eyes… </i>

139
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,494
Oh.

140
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,663
She didn't win?

141
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,176
Oh, damn it!

142
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,510
Hey!

143
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,846
Did something break?

144
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,723
- Here.
- Uh, sorry. Sorry about that.

145
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,183
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.

146
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,227
Donski, aren't you gonna respond?

147
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,606
Where is your reaction,
your emotion? Don't just stand there.

148
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,652
- My God, it's fallen. It fell.
- Can you give me a hand with these?

149
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,153
Here, can you take those?

150
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,404
Sorry.

151
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,406
Can you check if it's broken?

152
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,743
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry?

153
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,871
- Check the other side.
- Did he buy anything?

154
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,749
Son of a…

155
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,798
- Dad.
- Hey.

156
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,008
How's your day?

157
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:21,097
Did they play our song on the radio?
Was there any word from the record label?

158
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,973
Haven't heard anything.

159
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,770
Guess what, Dad?

160
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,980
I think I found her.

161
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,065
Who?

162
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,900
<i>I found Lorina!</i>

163
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,071
- Who's that?
- Her!

164
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,949
The girl in the painting I've been doing.

165
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,951
The one who was singing on the roof.

166
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,704
Now, I can finally finish it.

167
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,081
I'm glad you found her.

168
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,750
Have you found a job?

169
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,587
I have a job already.

170
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,965
Really?

171
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,593
You don't make any money playing gigs.

172
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,139
Uh, well, just give it a little more time.

173
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,725
With a bit more practice
and a little patience,

174
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,477
I know in my heart
that we're gonna make it.

175
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,063
Still got your head in the clouds.

176
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,442
I'm gonna need some help
finishing this lettering off.

177
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,985
My back is sore.

178
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,321
All right, Dad. I'll go get changed.

179
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,970
Hello.

180
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,224
Sharon Cuneta. This album is great!

181
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,019
Sure is. I'm getting it for my dad.

182
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,606
He loves old music. How much?

183
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,232
One-fifty.

184
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,611
Here. One-fifty.

185
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,529
Thank you.

186
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,535
My dad said that this album was
what made Sharon Cuneta famous.

187
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,789
Just like Regine
after she won that singing contest.

188
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,708
You know your Filipino music.

189
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,626
Yeah.

190
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,586
You too, right?

191
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,379
Weren't you in that singing contest?

192
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,134
Um, <i>The Next Champion</i>?

193
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,138
Wait a sec. You look familiar.

194
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,182
Huh?

195
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,769
You're the guy
that knocked over the stand!

196
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,234
And wait a second.
How did you know about the contest?

197
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,611
From 1984?

198
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,119
- Uh, come with me. Come on, come here.
- Uh… Oh. Did I do something wrong?

199
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,121
Lorinski, what's going on?

200
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,040
Uh, sir, he was stealing.

201
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,250
- Huh?
- I'm telling the guard.

202
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,254
- Hey, what? I swear I paid for this.
- I've had enough of your excuses. Come on.

203
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,630
What the heck is going on?

204
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,966
Where are we going?

205
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,553
Why would you say that?
I didn't steal anything.

206
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,846
Tell me who you are.

207
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,556
How do you know all of that?

208
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,765
Calm down.

209
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,767
I'll explain everything.

210
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,018
Don't be so paranoid.

211
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,688
I'm not paranoid. Now talk.

212
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,982
1984.

213
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,694
You were on the rooftop,
and someone clapped.

214
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,366
Okay, I remember. What about it?

215
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,870
Well, I'm the one who clapped.

216
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,831
That was you?

217
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,624
Yeah.

218
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,882
I was really impressed by your talent,
but I got embarrassed, so I hid.

219
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,509
And then you were gone.

220
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,345
I found out later that Regine had won.

221
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,765
What's it matter if I won or not?

222
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,685
And why do you keep coming
to this record store?

223
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:02,359
I guess… I wanted to know why
you never entered another contest.

224
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,822
- You're an incredible singer.
- Wait a second. Hold up.

225
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,992
You know way too much about me.
What's your deal?

226
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,119
Who exactly are you?

227
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,999
Sorry. My name is Entoy Mangarap.

228
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,010
Songwriter and vocalist in my band.

229
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,680
We're just waiting
for our song to be played on the radio,

230
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,641
and then we'll be famous.

231
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,017
Hang on.

232
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,560
Here.

233
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,855
Go on, put them on.

234
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,028
<i>I dedicate this</i>

235
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,989
<i>To my friends</i>

236
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,783
<i>To your friends</i>…

237
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,618
- That's you?
- Mm.

238
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,287
- That's you singing?
- Yeah, that's me.

239
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,625
So, what do you think? You like it?

240
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,085
It's all right.

241
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,878
Easy listening.

242
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,505
Pop rock.

243
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,886
All right, good luck with your band.
I hope you guys get airplay.

244
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,266
Thanks, I guess.

245
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,620
Oh, it's unlocked.

246
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,871
Entoy?

247
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,460
- Hey.
- Hey.

248
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,881
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, I'm here for my cousin's taping.

249
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,799
And you?

250
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,802
They needed a guitarist on another show.

251
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,555
You really are a musician!

252
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,392
That's right.
Did you think I was lying to you?

253
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,685
You're so paranoid.

254
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,478
Hey, I'm not paranoid.

255
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,646
Oh.

256
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,689
Lorina Dominguez.

257
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,066
I work at The Record Station,

258
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,152
I lost a singing contest in '84,

259
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:12,614
and now I'm a PA for my cousin,
as in personal assistant.

260
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,825
Are you done here?

261
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,245
Not yet. Gonna be a while.

262
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,833
I just went out
because I was tired and it's so cold.

263
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,751
Uh…

264
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,129
Would you mind if I stuck around?

265
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,756
Do what you want.

266
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,799
Awesome. Great.

267
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,885
Let's take a walk.

268
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,929
So, will you answer my question?

269
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:41,101
- Question?
- Why you never entered the contest again.

270
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,231
That was supposed
to be my last singing contest,

271
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,318
kind of like my last chance
to be discovered,

272
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,489
except I got so nervous, I froze.

273
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,157
I had no voice.

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,493
<i>They even turned out the lights on me.</i>

275
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,746
And you never entered another one?

276
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,165
Don't you wanna sing?

277
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,335
Of course I still wanna sing.

278
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,963
But it wasn't a priority
for me and my mom, you know.

279
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,593
Oh. What do your mom and dad do for work?

280
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,931
My mom's long gone.

281
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,767
In San Francisco.

282
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,727
She's a caregiver.

283
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,397
And as for my dad,
he used to drive a taxi.

284
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,399
When he was alive.

285
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,570
Sorry.

286
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,698
Hey, it was a long time ago.

287
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:42,287
You know, if I had won that contest,
my mother wouldn't have gone to San Fran.

288
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,832
Don't be like that.

289
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,835
Your mom just wanted
to give you a bright future.

290
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,045
That's right.

291
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,131
How about you?

292
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,259
What does your future hold?

293
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,095
Nothing!

294
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,514
- Wanna sit?
- All right.

295
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,436
Nothing. Zilch.

296
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,233
No matter how old I get,
my dad never stops worrying about me.

297
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,112
He always says there's no money in music.

298
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,531
And your mom?

299
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,993
She always believed in me.

300
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,704
When she was alive.

301
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,542
Sorry.

302
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,752
Long time ago.

303
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,713
I was in high school.

304
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,259
My mom got really sick,

305
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,888
and after she died,
I started my first band.

306
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,267
That's so sad. Your mom never saw you?

307
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,060
That's right.

308
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,481
But it's okay,
even though our duo never happened,

309
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,777
'cause in college,
I formed A Band Named Tessa.

310
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,947
That was my mom's name.

311
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,450
Oh, that's sweet.

312
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,244
College? When did you finish your course?

313
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,373
I haven't yet. It's in progress.

314
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,126
I need to finish some units.

315
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
It's a Fine Arts degree.

316
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,255
It's what my dad studied.

317
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,928
But these days I'm busy with the band.

318
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,598
I've just finished up
my service crew contract,

319
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,684
so now I can really focus on the band.

320
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,230
We really wanna make it big like Bon Jovi

321
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>with heaps of hit songs</i>
<i>and hit albums, you know?</i>

322
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,985
I wanted that too,

323
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,530
so I could make my mom proud.

324
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,827
I wanted to perform on a real stage,
like a serious concert.

325
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
- Thanks. Thank you!
- <i>You know what I mean?</i>

326
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,332
Thank you!

327
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,965
Hey, why don't you join our band?

328
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,052
What's my role? A PA, I suppose?

329
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,930
- Hell no! Lead singer.
- What?

330
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,766
We could chase our dream together.

331
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
And how do you expect that to work?

332
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,106
I… We'll record a demo.

333
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,443
Then we'll get our song
on rotation on radio.

334
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,696
Then we'll get famous.

335
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,949
Pretty soon, we'll play the concert
you've been dreaming of.

336
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,075
Game?

337
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,077
All right, just slow down.

338
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm gonna need some time to think on it.
I'm busy, you know.

339
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,258
- Hey, do you have a pen and paper?
- Sure.

340
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,804
Here. For you.

341
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,183
Whose address is this?

342
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:56,231
Once you've decided,
head there on Sunday afternoon.

343
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,983
That's where our band rehearses.

344
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,902
No pressure.

345
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,197
Got it. No pressure.

346
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,338
This is it, just here. Thanks a lot.

347
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,105
Hey, Toy, do you know
where our new bandmate is?

348
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,484
She's probably just having trouble
finding it.

349
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,027
Huh. So what's her name?

350
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,321
- Her name?
- It's not Meredith, is it?

351
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,075
That's why I get stoned,
so I can forget about her.

352
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,702
- But you still remember, don't you?
- You mean Marie?

353
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,913
- Marie! That's hilarious.
- Sir.

354
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,248
- Hey!
- Hey.

355
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,709
- Sorry. Was I late?
- Uh-huh.

356
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,419
- It's all good.
- No. No, you weren't.

357
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,089
Time is relative.

358
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,509
Uh, everyone, this is Lorina.

359
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,969
- Lorina, this is our band. Uh--
- Hello.

360
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,888
- This is Francis, our drummer.
- Yo.

361
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,806
Francis.

362
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,099
- OD on guitar.
- Hey, OD.

363
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,643
And this is Iggy, our bass player.

364
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,647
This place is Iggy's house.
It's got a studio.

365
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,274
Do you partake in ganja?

366
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,903
- Don't, asshole. What are you doing?
- Ah, that's okay. I'll pass.

367
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,113
You crazy?

368
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,989
Wanna have a look at the studio?

369
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,908
- Definitely.
- All right, let's go.

370
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,495
The studio. This is where we rehearse.

371
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,457
- Sorry, it's kind of a mess.
- Hey, don't worry about that.

372
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,084
- I'll put these away.
- It's nice.

373
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,129
- Can I put this down?
- Make yourself at home, huh?

374
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,381
- Thanks.
- Iggy Studios.

375
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,133
Uh, which of the songs have you learned?

376
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,677
- Give it here. I'll take a look.
- Here. Pick one, any you like.

377
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,387
- Any song?
- Yeah, anything.

378
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,431
Hmm.

379
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,308
How about this one?

380
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,562
- That one? Oh, hell yeah.
- Okay.

381
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,563
Awesome!

382
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,566
Uh, hey, guys. You know the drill.

383
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,317
- Game?
- I'm game.

384
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,319
Hey, OD, let's try it in B this time.

385
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,863
- You got that? B.
- Did you say B?

386
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,156
Yeah, B.

387
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,949
- Good to go?
- Good to go!

388
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,827
Let's jam it out. Have fun.

389
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,329
Let's go!

390
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>The mystery of time </i>

391
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,492
<i>The rain falling on my shoulders </i>

392
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,495
<i>Under a festival of leaves </i>

393
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,081
<i>I took shelter… </i>

394
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,000
I told my wife I'd be home early.

395
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,878
See you at the next rehearsal?

396
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,213
You know OD?

397
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,550
He's got a family,
but he never misses rehearsal.

398
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:15,096
<i>Carried back by the breeze </i>

399
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,766
<i>I'll just laugh </i>

400
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,062
<i>Why should I weep… </i>

401
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,023
This year, unless we get our big break,

402
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,025
this band needs to break up.

403
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,903
Well, luckily,
it's not gonna come to that.

404
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,365
Because our big break is coming.

405
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:39,996
<i>And who wouldn't dance In the rain?</i>

406
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,625
<i>And who wouldn't go crazy in the rain? </i>

407
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,753
OD. Take it to G.

408
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,433
<i>A gift from the heavens</i>

409
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,396
<i>That took us in</i>

410
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,899
<i>A thousand memories</i>

411
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,902
<i>Carried by the drizzle</i>

412
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,322
<i>Hundreds of pictures</i>

413
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,951
<i>Flash before my eyes</i>

414
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,162
<i>Hundreds of memories</i>

415
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,458
<i>Brought back by the breeze</i>

416
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,670
<i>I'll just laugh</i>

417
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,924
<i>And why not?</i>

418
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,135
<i>My heart</i>

419
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,389
<i>Got played by the deranged</i>

420
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,560
<i>And the rain…</i>

421
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,772
Things are gonna be different
now that we've got Lorina in the band.

422
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,190
So I passed the audition?

423
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,821
<i>And who wouldn't go crazy In the rain?</i>

424
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:59,743
<i>Rain, rain</i>

425
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:05,749
<i>In the rain</i>

426
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,627
<i>Whoa</i>

427
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,211
- Oh, that rocked!
- Yeah!

428
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,338
Whoo-hoo!

429
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,006
That was great!

430
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,592
Aw, nice! That was awesome.

431
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,387
- All right, this is me.
- This is your place?

432
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,972
- Uh-huh.
- Ah!

433
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,059
- Do you live here by yourself?
- Wow, cool house.

434
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,269
No, with my aunt and cousin Lyn-Lyn.

435
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,646
All right, thanks.

436
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,814
- Oh, awesome.
- Thank you. Get home safe.

437
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,191
- All right, see you.
- Bye.

438
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,901
Uh, um, Lorina, wait.

439
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,277
What?

440
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,529
- Uh.
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,036
Can I get your telephone number?

442
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,205
Why?

443
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,583
You know, for when we have band practice.

444
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,460
- I can let you know when they are.
- Okay, here.

445
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,386
Awesome.

446
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,680
- I'll be in touch.
- Okay. See you later! Thank you again.

447
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,931
- Bye.
- See you later.

448
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,265
- Good night.
- Okay.

449
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,600
Good night.

450
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,145
- Good night!
- Moron.

451
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,856
- I know what you're doing.
- I don't know what you mean, dumbass.

452
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,441
- What the hell, bro?
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,442
What?

454
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,988
We just recruited a new vocalist,
and you're already trying to hit on her?

455
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,575
Remember, Entoy, we've been through this.

456
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,121
The last time you fell in love,
we disbanded.

457
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,250
Bro, I give you my word.
We will never break up.

458
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,712
- I'll never leave the band, all right?
- You expect us to believe that?

459
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:38,258
I give you my word, guys.
This is it. Believe me. It's gonna happen.

460
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,719
<i>Have you ever heard of the Eraserheads?</i>

461
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,430
<i>We just wanted to write a song that…</i>

462
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,390
<i>that would express</i>

463
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,810
<i>the true feelings of the anonymous singer.</i>

464
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,525
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Lorina? It's Entoy.</i>

465
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,112
Why are you calling?
Didn't we just see each other?

466
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,407
Uh… uh, uh, we did!

467
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,577
Are you hungry?

468
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,871
Say what?

469
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:13,877
Uh, I was wondering if you've eaten yet.

470
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,253
<i>Um…</i>

471
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,089
I ate already.

472
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,633
And you?

473
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,053
Ah, oh, I've eaten!

474
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,308
What's your favorite Filipino song?

475
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,226
My favorite Filipino song…

476
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,898
I'll go with Basil Valdez,
"It Rains When We're Together."

477
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,943
Oh, that one's great. My choice?

478
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,821
It really depends on my mood.

479
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,658
How did you decide
on which song to sing in the contest?

480
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,203
Does it depend on your mood too?

481
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,996
Not really.

482
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,499
Um, it was my dad.

483
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:57,086
My dad used to decide which song
to do in the competitions.

484
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,257
Maybe that's why I got so nervous.

485
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:08,973
That was the first competition
that I entered without my dad.

486
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,768
Mm. Sounds nerve-wracking.

487
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,397
If we were singing together,
would you get anxious?

488
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,525
I don't think you would.

489
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,901
And why is that?

490
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,945
'Cause you'd have me.

491
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,241
And… I'd be by your side the whole way.

492
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,659
I'll never leave.

493
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,928
Oh, oh, I know that. "Line to Heaven."

494
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:51,349
Uh-huh. It has really easy chords.
It's the only song I know.

495
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,018
I think I mentioned, I'm not great.

496
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,770
What? You sounded good.

497
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,064
Not nearly as good as you.

498
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,193
Actually, I have something to tell you.

499
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,403
What is it?

500
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,322
I still need to finish some units.

501
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,161
So where are you from? What province?

502
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,621
From Iligan.

503
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,875
So you're a Visayan?
Do you speak any Visayan?

504
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,877
A little bit, just a few things.

505
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,589
How do you say, um, "good morning?"

506
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,007
<i>Maayong buntag</i>.

507
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,259
<i>Maayong buntag</i>.

508
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,887
That's right.

509
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,184
Hey, look, I already taught you something!

510
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,022
That's right. Tell you what.

511
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,066
Next time, I'll teach you something.

512
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,319
Like what?

513
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,197
I'm not sure yet. I don't know.
I'll think of something.

514
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,619
I'm looking forward to it.
You're something else.

515
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,625
Who is your crush?

516
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,587
I don't have a crush.

517
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,714
Huh. That's weird.

518
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,716
Lorinski.

519
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,429
- Do you know that guy?
- Let me see if he needs any help.

520
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,601
What's he doing?
Is he gonna buy anything? Anyway…

521
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,603
- Hey!
- Hey.

522
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,146
Are you gonna make a purchase?

523
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,607
I won't make a purchase.

524
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,401
Then what are you doing?

525
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,654
Waiting for you to finish.

526
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,032
You nuts? I have a really long shift.

527
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,119
I know. I'm waiting for you to finish,
to walk you home.

528
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,291
Why would you do that?

529
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,137
Come on.

530
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,848
Do I really have to say it?

531
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,519
That's okay. I got the message.

532
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,692
All right, uh…

533
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,612
I'll wait for you outside.
Your boss looks angry.

534
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,073
I'll be back later.

535
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,703
Sure. Do what you want.

536
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,621
All right then.

537
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,665
Okay, see you later.

538
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,504
What?

539
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,353
- Here, let me get that for you.
- It's not heavy.

540
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,982
- Hey. I said I'll get it.
- Do you think I'm that fragile?

541
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:53,197
All aboard, everyone. Let's go, let's go.

542
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,590
- This really suits you.
- All right, come on.

543
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,051
- There's Lyn-Lyn. Hey.
- This is so cool.

544
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,220
- Uh, I brought food.
- Ah, that's great!

545
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,390
Your timing's perfect.
I'm so hungry. Thanks for that.

546
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,808
Lyn, this is Entoy.

547
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,019
- Entoy, meet Lyn-Lyn, my cousin.
- Hello.

548
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,479
Hello!

549
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,690
Hey, cousin,
is he the guy who keeps calling?

550
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,692
Of course.

551
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,070
Why are you whispering?
He's right next to me.

552
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,281
Of course it is,
and he's here to walk us home.

553
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,741
- Really?
- Mmm.

554
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,993
Ah, they said
that the taping's been delayed

555
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,703
and we could be here until dawn.

556
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,080
Is that all right?

557
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,457
That's fine.

558
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,876
- We're not tired at all, right?
- Mm. Mm.

559
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,044
You sure that's all right?

560
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,963
- Don't worry. We've got this, right?
- Mm.

561
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,966
Mr. Arnel,
can you give me a hand setting this up?

562
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,802
We need to move the camera.
Grab the cable.

563
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,720
I'm on it, director.

564
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,601
Can I get a hand over here? Thanks.

565
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,108
Director, we're in position.
Ready when you are.

566
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,703
- Hey! What if they see us here?
- Come on. Trust me, they won't.

567
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,084
Come on.

568
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,089
- Whoa!
- Pretty cool, huh?

569
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,842
This place is wild. How did you find it?

570
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,511
I heard about it from Jim.
He's one of the guards.

571
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,597
I come here sometimes
when I'm waiting for Lyn-Lyn.

572
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,519
Unbelievable.

573
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,941
All right, we're even now.
You taught me about this place.

574
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,943
Good. I'm glad!

575
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,571
Ooh.

576
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,239
Hey, isn't this…

577
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,243
All right, guess who?

578
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,995
Zuma. That's so easy!

579
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,997
Give me a challenge next time.

580
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,958
Here, look at this.
Do you know who this is?

581
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,877
Recognize him?

582
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,296
Ahh! A demon!

583
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,214
Oh!

584
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,884
How could you do that to a baby?

585
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,387
- That is not a baby. It's Satan.
- What do you mean?

586
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,139
- Just look at it.
- It's so cute.

587
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,099
Keep it away from me!

588
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,477
My heart just stopped!

589
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,318
Okay, uh, I think I remember.
All right, game on.

590
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,403
- Game on. Seven each.
- We get seven?

591
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,571
- Yeah.
- Okay.

592
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,368
She's a real pro, Jocelyn.
Does she often work this late?

593
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,454
Yeah, but she's used to it.

594
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,081
It's her playground, this studio.

595
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,127
One day, when our band gets its break,

596
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,297
I'll make sure
we get the perfect green room.

597
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,134
I think being famous is scary.

598
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,386
Like, really famous.

599
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,098
The world around you isn't your own.

600
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,519
Your entire motivation becomes
what others want from you

601
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,688
and what they expect you to do.

602
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,107
You have to come up with gimmicks.

603
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,152
You have to be controversial
to stay relevant.

604
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,238
It sounds exhausting.

605
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,031
What about you?

606
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,117
Are you ready for that kind of life?

607
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,870
Sure.

608
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,330
Whatever it takes.

609
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,708
Don't forget about all the benefits.

610
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:37,255
When you're famous, you have
more connections, more privileges.

611
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,091
Everything will be easier
when we're famous.

612
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,802
Anything we want,
whatever we wanna do, we can.

613
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,473
But it's not exactly
permanent fame, is it?

614
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,268
What about when fame ends?
Then there's nothing left.

615
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,229
Come on. You sound exactly
like my dad at the moment.

616
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,440
Lorina, think positive.

617
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,027
There's always a way to make it work,

618
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,863
especially if you really love what you do.

619
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,740
You'll never get tired.

620
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,453
Okay.

621
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,124
But, between you and me,

622
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,253
if its too much pressure, let's not do it.

623
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,090
You got it.

624
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,885
Mercy, can you take this?

625
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,304
It's so hot out.

626
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,472
- Auntie!
- Oh! Do we have a guest?

627
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,473
- Mm-hmm.
- Hm?

628
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,599
Mwah!

629
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,226
I'm gonna work on my assignment.

630
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,936
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, see you.

631
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,564
Auntie, this is Entoy.
Entoy, this is Ester.

632
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,940
Her daughter's Lyn-Lyn.

633
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,984
- It's a pleasure.
- Mm. Ah.

634
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,028
Oh!

635
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,240
Is this the boy
who's always calling Lorina?

636
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,910
- Uh… I am. That's me!
- Hmm.

637
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,831
I've heard a lot about you from Lyn-Lyn.

638
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,253
Promise me right now
that you're not going to hurt Lorina.

639
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,882
- Auntie!
- What? It's better to know, right?

640
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,760
And I promised your mother
that I'd look out for you.

641
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,722
Don't worry, Aunt Ester.
I promise I'll take good care of Lorina.

642
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,765
Hmm.

643
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,977
- He's a fast learner! Hmm.
- See, there's nothing to worry about.

644
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,146
All right. I'll leave you to it.

645
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,526
Dad?

646
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,278
Come on.

647
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,993
Uh, Dad. This is Lorina.

648
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,662
She's the newest member of our band.

649
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,623
- Good morning.
- My dad.

650
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,333
Oh, you're Visayan?

651
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,544
Uh, what? What's that mean?

652
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,922
She's not, Dad.
She only knows that phrase.

653
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh, right. Uh, come in.

654
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,428
Is that Sharon Cuneta?

655
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:55,518
Uh, yeah. I've painted her so often
that I can do it from memory.

656
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,814
Oh, I've heard from Entoy
that you're a really big fan of Sharon.

657
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,652
That so?

658
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,238
A big fan, huh?

659
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,410
Lorina, I only said that
because I wanted you to notice me.

660
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,203
Sorry.

661
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,664
Entoy, have you been telling lies?

662
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,166
I owned up to it and said I'm sorry.

663
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,964
Hey, look. What's that one?

664
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,551
Oh, uh, you're not supposed
to see that yet.

665
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,594
- Entoy.
- Yeah?

666
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,722
Can you get the paint
that I mixed from upstairs?

667
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,392
All right, Dad. Lorina, wait here.

668
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,726
Okay.

669
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,817
- You're a really good painter, Ben.
- Thank you.

670
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,112
Entoy tells me you've been
doing this a long time.

671
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,616
Oh, uh, I've been doing it since the '70s.

672
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,745
<i>My first job when I moved</i>
<i>from the countryside</i>

673
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,539
<i>was delivering film reels.</i>

674
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:04,003
<i>I met someone who painted movie posters,</i>
<i>and I set up my own business.</i>

675
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,338
Looks like another all-nighter.

676
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,132
Mom! Dad!

677
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,925
You've been working hard.

678
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,261
Don't worry. I've got this.

679
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,681
- Come on, it's time for dinner!
- Go get cleaned up.

680
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,933
<i>Things were good back then.</i>

681
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,060
Nowadays,

682
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,314
there's not much work.

683
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:29,737
I don't know if there's still a place
for us in the Philippines.

684
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,908
Don't lose hope, Ben.
Your work is important.

685
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,537
I'm always saying to Entoy…

686
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,958
time passes so quickly.

687
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,377
One day,

688
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,131
you can be on top of the world.

689
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,218
And then,

690
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:57,890
a day later, you fall to the ground.

691
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,311
And everything comes crashing down.

692
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,235
Come here. I'll show you something.

693
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,321
It isn't done yet.

694
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,865
- Here.
- Whoa!

695
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,034
- It's great! You made this?
- You like it?

696
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,953
It's so good.

697
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,788
I still need to paste these on.

698
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,083
- It's amazing.
- Thanks so much.

699
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,501
Entoy…

700
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,590
Do you think
that your dad's clients will come back?

701
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,469
Of course. My dad is an excellent painter.

702
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,266
Why? What did he tell you?
Don't listen to him.

703
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,393
He's got a lot on his mind.

704
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,605
The older he gets,
the more he starts to worry.

705
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,108
Here, take a look.

706
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:50,943
I WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU

707
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,486
This is our new single.

708
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,822
- Ah! You wrote this?
- Mm.

709
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,491
I've finished the lyrics,
but it still needs work.

710
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,452
I'll teach it to you guys at rehearsal.

711
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,914
And then we should record.

712
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:08,127
Then we can distribute it
to radio stations, and like that, airplay.

713
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:13,173
Uh, what if it doesn't get airplay?
What happens then?

714
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,676
Don't worry. I've got a backup plan.

715
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,970
Prod night.

716
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,307
- Prod night?
- Mm.

717
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,349
What's that?

718
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,479
<i>It's like a concert</i>
<i>with lots of different bands and artists,</i>

719
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,690
<i>and all of them perform on the night.</i>

720
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:35,362
We'll invite artist managers,
A&R reps and labels,

721
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,033
and if they like our performance,
then we'll get signed.

722
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,659
That's prod night.

723
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,995
Um, we'll be taking the stage?

724
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,079
Mm.

725
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:45,831
Like a concert?

726
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:50,502
Pretty much, but in a smaller venue.

727
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:54,673
Up next, Miss Lorina Dominguez!

728
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,893
Lorina, you all right?

729
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,480
What's going on?
Here, sit down. Sit down, sit down.

730
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,275
Hey, it's okay.
Relax, just relax. I'm right here.

731
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,404
Hey, it's all right.
Uh, just relax, okay? Relax.

732
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,126
Entoy, what if this happens on prod night?

733
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,089
What if I can't even sing?

734
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,932
That won't happen, Lorina.

735
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,809
Relax, okay?

736
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,686
We've got this.

737
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,438
You can do it. Relax, okay?

738
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,530
I'm right here, Lorina. Yeah?

739
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,580
<i>I won't give up on you </i>

740
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,044
<i>I'll reach you</i>
<i>No matter where you are… </i>

741
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,215
- Uh, this is our studio.
- Sick.

742
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,551
<i>Even if my pockets are empty</i>

743
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,802
<i>And my voice gives out </i>

744
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,264
<i>I'll never give up on you </i>

745
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,394
<i>I won't give up on you </i>

746
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,983
<i>I'll reach you no matter where you are </i>

747
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,653
<i>Won't give up </i>

748
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,573
<i>Even if my pockets are empty</i>
<i>And my voice gives out </i>

749
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:46,243
<i>I will never give up on you </i>

750
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,539
Nice one!

751
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:54,418
<i>The apparition</i>
<i>that is being investigated at La Union…</i>

752
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,380
That's a pretty good gimmick.
Instant fame.

753
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,758
<i>Blood appeared to drip</i>

754
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,219
<i>from a statue of the Virgin Mary,</i>
<i>accompanied by bright lights…</i>

755
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,471
Miracles do happen.

756
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,306
- Hey. Sir.
- I'm kidding.

757
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,767
Your songs are really good.
I think you'll like it.

758
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,852
Approved.

759
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,687
Say no to drugs, huh?

760
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,900
- Sir, thank you!
- Thank you so much. Did you add reverb?

761
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,359
- Come on.
- Thank you!

762
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,861
Thank you, sir!

763
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,613
- Hey, give us a look!
- Look at that!

764
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,572
Yay!

765
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,782
- Let me see.
- We did it! Here.

766
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,117
- Take a look.
- Give me, give me, give me, give me!

767
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,161
Hey, Iggy, try not to lose it.

768
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,330
Our first record!

769
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,585
Entoy, what if nothing happens
with the band this year?

770
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,254
It'll happen.

771
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,591
You know that I've got a plan, right?

772
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,553
Have faith.

773
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,431
I know our band has what it takes.

774
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,103
Especially you, Lorina.

775
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,316
Really?

776
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,360
It's true.

777
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,447
From the start,

778
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,160
since I first heard you
practice on the rooftop,

779
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,247
I couldn't help but admire you.

780
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,502
Anyway…

781
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,130
I think I've loved you ever since.

782
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,842
That was fast.

783
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,636
What?

784
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,973
You don't believe me.

785
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,600
I don't know.

786
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,526
Will you give me your hand?

787
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,443
Why?

788
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,987
Just give it here.

789
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,949
Wait, what is this? What are you doing?

790
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,494
Trust me, Lorina.
Don't be scared. Give it here.

791
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,496
I'm not ready, Entoy.

792
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,624
- I can't.
- Nothing bad's gonna happen. Just give it.

793
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,669
Lorina,

794
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,465
if you still don't believe
that my love is real…

795
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,682
You're making me nervous.

796
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,977
Just listen to this!

797
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,064
- You idiot! You freaked me out.
- What? Why?

798
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,108
- Oh.
- I worked hard on it.

799
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,110
When did you put this together?

800
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,069
TO LOVE AGAIN
RAIN

801
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,529
You put in so much work.

802
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,450
I started on it after I first saw you
at The Record Station.

803
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,953
That's the second tape.
The first one got ruined.

804
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,584
When you love what you're doing,
it doesn't even feel like work.

805
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,633
- These are all my favorite artists.
- Mm.

806
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,178
Check out side B.

807
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,263
WHEN I MET YOU - I REMEMBER YOU
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU

808
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,474
Do you need me to spell it out?

809
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,311
Or can you tell why I chose those songs?

810
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,063
That's okay.

811
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,107
I love you right back, Entoy.

812
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:09,947
You mean that?

813
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,784
- You're not messing with me, are you?
- No way, I promise.

814
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,744
- I promise!
- You love me too?

815
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,621
Mm-hmm.

816
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,710
<i>How many more songs Do I have to sing…</i>

817
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,798
Even when my hair turns gray,
will you love me still?

818
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,634
Whoever you are!

819
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,056
- Entoy!
- Ah, hello.

820
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,392
- It's getting late now.
- Hi, good evening. Oh.

821
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,060
- Probably head home.
- Time to leave.

822
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,853
- I was just leaving.
- He was about to leave.

823
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,355
- I should head home.
- You're leaving?

824
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,606
Okay, I'm heading off.

825
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,066
- All right.
- Well, good night.

826
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,068
- Okay, good night.
- Oh, good night then.

827
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,695
- Night, Lyn-Lyn.
- Good night.

828
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,908
<i>My love </i>

829
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,787
<i>How many more bottle caps</i>
<i>Do I have to collect </i>

830
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,789
<i>My love </i>

831
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,749
I WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU
A BAND NAMED TESSA

832
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,086
<i>I'll do anything, even your thesis… </i>

833
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,797
Okay. Come on.

834
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,093
Where do you think you're going?

835
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,971
Uh, can you let us up to Crib FM,

836
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,764
so we can give them our demo?

837
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,850
Can I see some ID?

838
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,309
We don't have any ID.

839
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,104
I can't let you upstairs without any ID.

840
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,983
Okay then, we'll be right back.

841
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,484
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,363
<i>Because my heart has no fears… </i>

843
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:38,118
<i>That we’ll live</i>
<i>In peace and pure happiness </i>

844
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,120
Okay, ready?

845
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,830
Come on, let's go! Hurry.

846
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,499
Iggy, Iggy, wait here, okay?

847
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,918
Quick, let's go.

848
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,630
- Hey! I think I'm injured.
- Here it is.

849
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,340
Come on, hurry.

850
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,511
See? We made it. We made it.

851
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
This way.

852
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,807
Hey, miss? A Band Named Tessa.

853
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,850
Okay, thanks.

854
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,393
A Band Named Tessa.

855
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,273
A Band Named Tessa.
A Band Named Tessa. A Band Named Tessa.

856
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:12,027
As soon as you hear the DJ
announce the name of our band,

857
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,323
press both of these buttons,
play and record, simultaneously.

858
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,532
Simple as that.

859
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,284
Uh, did they play it yet?

860
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,620
Not yet.

861
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,754
I can't believe
how exhausting that was.

862
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:37,219
All that effort and time
just for a chance at getting airplay.

863
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,389
And we still don't know
if they'll play it.

864
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,600
Not all songs get radio play.

865
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,063
That's the industry.
That's just how it works.

866
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,148
I just had a thought.

867
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,111
<i>What if we send our demo as a letter?</i>

868
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,948
- Uh, what do you mean?
- As a letter.

869
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,535
We could send a letter
to the radio stations with our demo.

870
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,953
Here, I'll show you.

871
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,708
Huh? Sent.

872
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,960
Isn't that easier?

873
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,963
That could work.

874
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,551
- No.
- Wait, so it's just me then?

875
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,927
- What's up, bro?
- Hey.

876
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,972
- Hi.
- How you doing? Have they played it yet?

877
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:26,601
<i>It seems some of the winners</i>
<i>did not deserve their awards.</i>

878
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,688
Not yet.

879
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,274
And my wife's been listening
the whole day,

880
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,234
but she hasn't heard anything.

881
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,402
Nothing.

882
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,947
How long are we gonna wait?
An entire week's passed.

883
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,996
Everyone,

884
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,124
me and Lorina have something to tell you.

885
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,376
We already know.

886
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,963
It's obvious, right?

887
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,632
You're a couple.

888
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,260
You idiot.

889
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,179
What's so funny?

890
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,805
- No.
- That's not it.

891
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,056
See this?

892
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,476
What's that?

893
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,313
We're playing this show.

894
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,733
Prod night?

895
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,487
- Now we're talking. Huh.
- That's right. We're doing it.

896
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,488
Prod night.

897
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,700
Lorinski, you've been absent,
you've been late,

898
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,994
you've been zoning out and losing focus.

899
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,788
Lately, your performance has been so poor

900
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,791
that I had to give
Employee of the Month to Donski.

901
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,169
Do you know
how desperate things have gotten?

902
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,631
When I'm in love, right,
my focus gets better

903
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:42,469
and I actually work harder
because life is just amazing, right?

904
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,428
'Cause love…

905
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:52,103
<i>I'll give my whole life </i>

906
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,857
<i>Just to see you happy </i>

907
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,859
Hi, Entoy!

908
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,861
Sir, this is Entoy.

909
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,030
He's dating my cousin, Lorina.

910
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,824
Entoy, Mr. Santos, my manager.

911
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,618
Hi, good evening.

912
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,329
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, you can take a seat there.

913
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,248
Okay, thanks.

914
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,376
Okay.

915
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,586
Jocelyn, uh, are you good?

916
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,046
Yeah, I'm good.

917
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,261
<i>Why do I love you? </i>

918
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:28,056
<i>Even when you ignore my feelings? </i>

919
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,935
<i>Even if you don't love me</i>
<i>I'm still here </i>

920
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,396
<i>Loving you faithfully </i>

921
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,565
<i>Why do I love you? </i>

922
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,025
<i>Even when you have… </i>

923
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,819
Uh, Mr. Santos?

924
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:44,990
Uh, I'd like to invite you
to our prod night concert.

925
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,576
<i>How long do I have to endure this?</i>

926
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:53,957
<i>Oh, why do I love you?</i>

927
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,333
Ah!

928
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,378
So you're in a band?

929
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,337
I am.

930
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,966
Lorina and I share the lead vocals.

931
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:04,801
Hm.

932
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,220
Interesting.

933
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,809
Uh, I'll have to check my schedule.

934
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,063
- I'll try my best, all right?
- Thanks, sir.

935
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,440
- Thanks.
- That's okay.

936
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,275
- Thank you.
- No problem.

937
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:23,653
Hm?

938
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,989
- How'd it go?
- All good.

939
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,991
All good?

940
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,541
Good evening.

941
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,128
- Oh.
- I'll do this.

942
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,881
Don't. I'll get it.
You're home late again.

943
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:46,676
- Have you eaten yet?
- Yeah, I've eaten.

944
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,262
- Let me give you a hand with--
- Don't. I've got it.

945
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,016
I know that you were out with Entoy,

946
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:57,228
but it still isn't safe
to be out this late.

947
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,732
Especially for a young woman.

948
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,693
Sorry, Auntie.

949
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,864
I was just rehearsing with the band.
That's why I was out so late.

950
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,325
You know, Lorina,

951
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,952
I don't wanna interfere with your plans.

952
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,998
But is this the life you really want?

953
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:26,841
Hello?

954
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,760
<i>Hello, Lorina!</i>

955
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,595
Mom!

956
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,974
Mom, how have you been?
I've missed you so much.

957
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,728
<i>I've missed you more.</i>
<i>Oh, I've missed you so much.</i>

958
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,398
But things over here are good.

959
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,359
Hey, tell me about your boyfriend.

960
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,403
He's very handsome!

961
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:51,116
He's really nice. It's been going great.

962
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,826
<i>And you, how have you been?</i>

963
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,746
Don't worry, honey.
I'm well. I've met a lot of nice people.

964
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,790
Well, that's really good to hear.

965
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,376
I hope I get a chance to meet them.

966
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,879
Actually, that's the reason for my call.

967
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,633
<i>I just got the results</i>
<i>of your college application.</i>

968
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,594
You got in, Lorina!

969
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,681
Are you for real?

970
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,100
<i>And I have some even better news.</i>

971
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,352
I can cover your tuition fees.

972
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,313
<i>You just need</i>
<i>to take care of your student visa</i>

973
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,607
<i>so you can enroll</i>
<i>for the coming school year.</i>

974
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:30,405
<i>Oh honey,</i>
<i>we can finally be together again.</i>

975
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,949
<i>This is what we've been waiting for.</i>

976
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,745
That sounds great.

977
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,749
I've got to go, but we'll talk soon, okay?

978
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,334
Take care of yourself.

979
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,086
<i>Love you, hon.</i>

980
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,464
Love you, Ma.

981
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,989
- Stand back, don't push.
- Hello!

982
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,867
- Make some room, please.
- Oh! Thanks.

983
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,369
Hey! Hey, Jocelyn, I'm next.

984
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,872
- That's so kind! Thanks.
- Will you sign this, please?

985
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:24,709
Wait! Hey, Jocelyn, I'm next!

986
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,877
Just chill out.

987
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,170
One at a time.

988
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,422
- What the hell? Quit pushing!
- I was here first!

989
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,342
- The hell you were. Get off of me!
- Get in line! Get off!

990
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:37,430
Lyn-Lyn. Hey, just stand back.
Just stand back, okay?

991
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,473
- It's my turn!
- Jocelyn!

992
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:42,519
Just stay calm. Just calm down, everyone.

993
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,813
- Lyn-Lyn, are you okay?
- I'm all right.

994
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,483
Hey, stop! Get back!

995
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,027
- Back up now. Move, move.
- Stop pushing!

996
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,613
- Over here!
- Jocelyn, over here!

997
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,950
Get in. Get in.

998
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,493
- Bye bye!
- Let's get out of here.

999
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,203
Give her some room.

1000
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,670
- Lyn, for your arm. You okay?
- Ah, thank you, cousin. I'm good.

1001
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,471
My God, Jocelyn.

1002
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,390
What happened to you?

1003
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,767
It's nothing, Mom. It's just a scratch.

1004
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:27,188
Don't make a big deal out of it.
It's just part of accommodating the fans.

1005
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:31,025
How can your fans treat you
like this? It's terrifying!

1006
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,611
What if next time it's… it's even worse?

1007
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,489
I'm fine, Mom. Really.

1008
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,623
<i>You bastard </i>

1009
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,172
Make some noise!

1010
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,550
Put your hands in the air!

1011
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,511
You rock!

1012
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,056
Hell yeah.

1013
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,853
Let's give it up
for Band of Fools one more time!

1014
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,397
I can't hear you.

1015
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,651
I'm very excited
to introduce our next band tonight,

1016
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,653
A Band Named Tessa!

1017
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,700
Thanks, dude.

1018
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,036
Thanks for that.

1019
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,915
How y'all doing?

1020
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,294
It's great to be here.

1021
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,004
Yeah!

1022
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,048
We're A Band Named Tessa,

1023
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,843
and this song is called
"I Won't Give Up On You."

1024
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,303
Hope you like it.

1025
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,929
Hey, hang on. Where's Iggy?

1026
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,516
- Oh damn.
- Come on. What are you doing?

1027
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,061
I'm here. I'm here. Relax.

1028
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,647
- Just chill out, okay? Chill out.
- Where were you?

1029
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,858
I saw Regine Velasquez
and I got her autograph.

1030
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,153
Dude, you've got
to get your priorities straight.

1031
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,782
All right, uh, sorry, sorry,
We're ready now. Let's do this!

1032
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,951
- Game.
- You all good? Ready?

1033
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,872
Check it out, it's Regine!

1034
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,378
You ready?

1035
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,901
Entoy, you have to sing it.

1036
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,282

01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:32,457
<i>I realized that keeping it</i>
<i>Would only cause me pain </i>

1044
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,670
<i>So I tried to forget about it </i>

1045
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,506
<i>But this feeling always remained </i>

1046
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,509
<i>Tell me, will I ever survive? </i>

1047
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,013
<i>Stop my tears and keep it inside </i>

1048
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:52,769
<i>Holding back myself</i>
<i>From being close to you </i>

1049
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,034
<i>Being famous is scary.</i>

1050
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,535
<i>Here I am all alone… </i>

1051
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,163
<i>The world around you isn't your own.</i>

1052
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,625
<i>Not knowing how to help myself… </i>

1053
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,418
<i>Are you ready for that kind of life?</i>

1054
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,171
<i>Arrive at a decision </i>

1055
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:23,049
<i>I can't get you out of my mind </i>

1056
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,093
<i>I don't know what to do </i>

1057
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,847
<i>It's this feeling that's ever-growing </i>

1058
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:35,144
<i>It's this feeling I feel for you… </i>

1059
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,771
Congratulations. I'll see you.

1060
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,731
See you. Thank you.

1061
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,274
You won't regret it.

1062
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,400
Take care.

1063
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,320
<i>Stop my tears and keep it inside </i>

1064
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:50,201
<i>Holding back myself</i>
<i>From being close to you… </i>

1065
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,327
Whew!

1066
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,122
- Entoy.
- Babe! Hey!

1067
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,707
Are you all right?

1068
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,752
- You okay?
- I'm good.

1069
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,673
- Ready for the good news?
- Uh, what?

1070
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,552
Baby, the management deal came through!

1071
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,095
Seriously?

1072
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,054
It's true!

1073
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,764
Congrats!

1074
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,601
The crowd was insane tonight. Solid.

1075
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:19,355
All of those years of playing in bars
where nobody noticed us.

1076
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,816
We<i>… </i>We stopped doing it
because it was pointless.

1077
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,068
But tonight the crowd was so amazing!

1078
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:28,447
Baby, here's what I'm thinking for you.

1079
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:32,827
We'll record another demo
for your solo project.

1080
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:38,749
Then we'll give it to Mr. Santos, right?
So we can record our albums in tandem.

1081
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:44,046
Picture it. One album as the band.
One album is you solo.

1082
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,132
Sounds cool.

1083
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,844
You want me to record my own demo?

1084
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,053
I do.

1085
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,264
I was talking to Mr. Santos earlier.

1086
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,309
He said it's a selling point
having a female vocalist in the band.

1087
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:01,606
I said to him, "Mr. Santos,
maybe Lorina could record a solo album."

1088
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,191
Think about it.

1089
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,028
Your manager could be Mr. Santos.

1090
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,156
That wasn't part of the plan.

1091
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,869
It wasn't,
but it's still a cool idea, right?

1092
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,456
You'll have the same set-up as Lyn-Lyn.

1093
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,333
Slow down, Entoy.

1094
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,502
Who said you could make
all of these plans for my life?

1095
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,714
Uh, we're just recording a demo, baby.

1096
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,342
It's our plan, all right?

1097
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,761
It's our plan for you.

1098
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,846
This is how we're gonna make it.

1099
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,391
Is it our plan or your plan?

1100
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,325
Baby, can we talk about this?
I don't understand.

1101
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,037
Entoy, you make me happy.

1102
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,249
I like being together.

1103
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,211
Because I love you.

1104
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,798
I<i>… </i>I know.

1105
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,926
And I love you so much.

1106
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,681
That's why I want for us
to follow our dreams together.

1107
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,187
But this isn't my dream.

1108
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,026
Lorina, what do you mean?
What is your dream then?

1109
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,196
Entoy, I thought this is what I wanted.

1110
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:38,995
It made me so happy to think
we could achieve our dreams together.

1111
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:43,541
But, Entoy, the closer we get
to reaching our dreams,

1112
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,585
the more that I want to take a step back.

1113
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:51,465
I could've got back on stage
to sing with you,

1114
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,426
but I didn't want to.

1115
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,685
- But I thought this was our world.
- Mm-mm.

1116
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,146
It isn't.

1117
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,488
I love you. That's why I'm here.

1118
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:20,369
I love you so much,

1119
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:26,250
and that's the reason why
I set aside what I really want.

1120
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,296
So we could have more time together.

1121
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,150
I don't want you to pretend.

1122
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,488
What do you really want?

1123
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,251
I want to finish my studies.

1124
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,712
Okay.

1125
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,548
Mm.

1126
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,051
I want a quiet life.

1127
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,930
That's what you want?

1128
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,937
I wanna be with my mom.

1129
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,148
What about us?

1130
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,699
If you came with me to San Francisco,

1131
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:44,120
would you be pretending?

1132
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:02,304
You know
I can't just leave this place, Lorina.

1133
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,764
I know.

1134
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,144
No pretending.

1135
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,646
Hold on, Lorina.

1136
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,524
Wait a second.

1137
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,985
Wait a second.

1138
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,071
What are you saying?

1139
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,241
You're leaving?

1140
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,661
What about us?

1141
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,289
Are we over?

1142
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:33,794
Or are we gonna stay together?
Uh, how does that work?

1143
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,339
Tell me, Lorina,
how are we going to do this?

1144
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,971
Maybe we shouldn't see each other, Entoy.

1145
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,765
What?

1146
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,435
Why not?

1147
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,021
We shouldn't see each other?

1148
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,440
So we're breaking up right now?
We're through?

1149
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,150
- Entoy.
- When do you leave?

1150
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:58,777
Tonight? Tomorrow night?
What happened to our plans?

1151
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:02,281
Entoy, please,
you have to let me make my own decision.

1152
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,038
This isn't easy for me, Entoy.

1153
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,085
I'm sorry, Entoy.

1154
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:18,839
I'm sorry.

1155
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,095
Entoy.

1156
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,558
Entoy, I'm sorry.

1157
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,352
This isn't fair, Lorina.

1158
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:37,274
I can't believe

1159
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:41,528
that you left me out of your plans.

1160
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,908
Entoy. Entoy, I'm sorry.

1161
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,579
Entoy.

1162
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,248
Lorina.

1163
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,969
I'm sorry, Entoy.

1164
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:06,971
I'm sorry.

1165
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:15,854
<i>Say you'll never go </i>

1166
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:22,319
<i>Say you'll never go out my way </i>

1167
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:29,618
<i>Say you'll never go </i>

1168
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:34,832
<i>For we can still go on</i>
<i>And make it through </i>

1169
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:36,959
<i>Make it through our lives </i>

1170
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,962
<i>Just say you'll never go </i>

1171
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:47,011
<i>Say you'll never go away </i>

1172
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:53,517
<i>How can I make my dreams come true </i>

1173
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,688
<i>Without you </i>

1174
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,360
<i>You were the one who gave love to me </i>

1175
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,404
<i>And don't you know </i>

1176
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:10,576
<i>You are my fantasy </i>

1177
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,412
<i>How can I carry on… </i>

1178
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,164
Hey, Entoy!

1179
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,542
Anyone heard from Lorina?

1180
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,253
What's wrong with you?

1181
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:28,761
<i>When all that is left</i>
<i>Is the pain of our history </i>

1182
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:34,725
<i>Why should I live my life today? </i>

1183
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,561
San Francisco, bro.

1184
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:39,229
Mmm.

1185
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,606
She's out of here.

1186
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,942
Her mom lives there, so she wants to go.

1187
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,487
Shit, that sucks.

1188
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,864
And what about you two?

1189
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,909
It's over.

1190
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,161
We're done.

1191
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:56,121
You didn't fight for her?

1192
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:00,459
What would be the point?
She's made her decision.

1193
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:03,504
You know

1194
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,799
that she really loves you, right?

1195
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,552
She just broke up with me.

1196
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:15,516
Maybe she's leaving out of love.

1197
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:19,645
She's leaving
so that you can focus on the band.

1198
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,107
If you stayed together
without her in the band,

1199
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,775
your time would be split.

1200
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:30,030
She made a hard choice
so you wouldn't have to. Hm?

1201
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:34,743
She cares about you too much
to stand in the way of your goals.

1202
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:44,837
Hello?

1203
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,296
<i>Hello.</i>

1204
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,173
Hello, Auntie.

1205
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,178
Uh, this is Entoy. Uh, is Lorina there?

1206
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,431
<i>Entoy.</i>

1207
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,351
Um, she's not here.

1208
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,228
Did you want to leave a message?

1209
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,231
Uh, that's okay.

1210
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,277
Uh, never mind. Thanks anyway.

1211
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,486
Thanks. Bye.

1212
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,988
Okay.

1213
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:20,289
I remember
Dad would always ask me to sing.

1214
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:23,459
Whenever he'd ask, I'd sing my heart out.

1215
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,962
This is the bracelet
I've been looking for.

1216
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,839
Hmm.

1217
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:32,634
I remember Mom taking me
to my first singing contest.

1218
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,554
We looked everywhere for it,
but we couldn't find it.

1219
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,141
It was my lucky charm, a gift from my dad.

1220
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:42,060
Oh, sorry, Auntie. Did you need something?

1221
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:43,854
Uh…

1222
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,148
It's Entoy.

1223
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,150
He keeps calling.

1224
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,861
Why won't you talk to him?

1225
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,032
What am I supposed to say?

1226
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,497
He'll just get his hopes up.
But in the end, I'm still gonna go.

1227
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,920
It must be difficult, to avoid him.

1228
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,423
It is difficult.

1229
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:17,638
The truth is
I was always on a different path to Entoy.

1230
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,060
He knew what he wanted before we ever met.

1231
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,563
That's why he's lucky he's got you.

1232
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,650
What are you saying?

1233
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,320
You love with all your heart.

1234
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,450
And your love isn't just for you,

1235
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,161
but for others as well.

1236
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:44,498
I don't think that he sees it that way.

1237
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,294
I think he's really hurt.

1238
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,300
When a person truly loves,

1239
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:59,805
they can see past all that
to what's inside of you.

1240
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:05,936
Even if we hurt them
with our actions or with our words,

1241
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:11,483
in the end, all that will pass
and they'll see what's in your heart.

1242
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:19,783
Thanks, Auntie.

1243
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,954
Thanks for everything.

1244
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,462
Okay, one more.

1245
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,926
- Not bad.
- Okay.

1246
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:42,764
All right. Uh, let's do solo shots.

1247
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,517
Put that away.

1248
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,518
- Sir.
- Yo.

1249
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,936
- Mr. Santos.
- Hi.

1250
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,689
- Mr. Henry.
- Just Henry. You've already been signed.

1251
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,609
- Oh right. Uh, Henry.
- Mm.

1252
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,737
Before I forget, uh, here, Henry.

1253
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,656
This is what we want for the album cover.

1254
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,992
This is how I wanna present the band.

1255
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,579
Looks okay, man.

1256
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:10,375
Uh, wait. Is the mock-up around, uh…
Oh, can I have that?

1257
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,544
- Here, sir.
- Yeah.

1258
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:15,797
This is what our team's come up with.

1259
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,177
It's been approved already
by MG Music Management.

1260
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,928
And for what it's worth,
I strongly believe

1261
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,723
that this is the right direction
for your album cover.

1262
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,019
You guys should be featured,
especially you, Entoy.

1263
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,522
Pretty cool, huh? You like it?

1264
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:35,692
- Uh-huh.
- Right? I think it's fly.

1265
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,277
- You think?
- It's perfect.

1266
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,612
It pops out.

1267
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:41,490
It gives you a sense of each
of the different band members.

1268
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:42,407
Mm.

1269
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,077
- You okay, man?
- You wanna see their faces.

1270
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,163
- Fine. Looks good.
- That's right.

1271
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:49,956
It's authentic.

1272
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,278
Is that Lorina?

1273
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,525
- It's fun.
- It's so cold. I just went out.

1274
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,902
- It's freezing.
- Don't worry. It's fine.

1275
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:13,832
- I'll put in a good word.
- Okay.

1276
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,792
- Argh!
- Let me help you out there, Jeff.

1277
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:17,627
- I'll be out back, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1278
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,588
- I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

1279
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:27,387
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID

1280
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,055
THAT YOU LOVE ME TOO

1281
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,522
YOU SAID YOUR LOVE WILL NEVER FADE

1282
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,028
BUT YOU KEEP PUSHING ME AWAY

1283
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,280
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU NO MATTER HOW LONG

1284
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,367
DON'T THEY KNOW WE MADE A VOW

1285
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:00,754
MY LOVE IS FOREVER YOURS

1286
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,356
Oh, corned beef?

1287
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,149
- Thank you.
- Yum.

1288
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,611
- Lorina, you've only packed two suitcases.
- Yeah. That's everything that I need.

1289
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:27,948
- Really? What about your passport?
- We've got everything.

1290
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,908
It's in my bag upstairs.

1291
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,785
Why don't you go and get it?

1292
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,912
- Mom, let her finish eating.
- Don't worry. It's fine.

1293
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,456
- It doesn't hurt to be sure.
- Wait, cousin.

1294
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,709
Are you really gonna leave me
here with her?

1295
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:42,629
Come on. Stop being so dramatic, Lyn-Lyn.

1296
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,465
Just go and get it.
You don't wanna leave it.

1297
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,883
I'm just joking, Ma.

1298
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,927
You know how much I love you.

1299
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,763
Will you come to my shows
while I'm looking for a new PA?

1300
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,181
Of course I will.

1301
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,642
All right, finish your lunch.

1302
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:57,394
- Okay, Mom.
- Can you pass the fruit, please?

1303
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:58,645
- You want this?
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,400
Dad, are you sure
you're gonna be okay without me?

1305
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:05,777
I'll be fine.

1306
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,864
I'll call you
as soon as I get there, okay?

1307
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,699
Let me know if you need anything.

1308
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,250
Lorina?

1309
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:22,878
Are you ready?

1310
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,714
- Let's go.
- Come on then.

1311
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,801
Oh, Dad.

1312
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,888
Keep an ear out
in case the radio plays our band.

1313
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,725
I'll listen out.
You better get going or you'll be late.

1314
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,852
Don't forget to take your medicine.

1315
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:42,230
- See you. I'm going.
- All right. Take care.

1316
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,232
- Get in. Hurry.
- Bye.

1317
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:46,985
Take care, Ben.

1318
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,654
- It's clogged.
- Don't worry about it.

1319
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,780
Sorry. Sorry.

1320
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,366
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Let's go!

1321
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:55,076
Dad.

1322
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:01,791
<i>I thought back then</i>
<i>That you and I were meant to be </i>

1323
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:07,714
<i>It's funny, girl, how I believed</i>
<i>That you really, really care </i>

1324
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:14,095
<i>You said that I will always be</i>
<i>The one for you </i>

1325
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:20,060
<i>Tell me, babe, who's that guy</i>
<i>You kissed last night? </i>

1326
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:25,774
<i>You knew how much I really loved you </i>

1327
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:29,110
<i>Seems you just contained your love… </i>

1328
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,111
What consistency?

1329
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,114
<i>Running away </i>

1330
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,992
<i>From the places and things… </i>

1331
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:39,454
- Miss Myra from MG Music.
- Thank you.

1332
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,289
A BAND NAMED TESSA
I'M YOURS, YOU'RE MINE

1333
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,708
<i>All these feelings I ache inside </i>

1334
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,210
<i>Running away </i>

1335
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:50,006
<i>I've been trying so hard</i>
<i>To keep away from you </i>

1336
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,759
<i>Now forgetting you</i>
<i>Is all I have to do… </i>

1337
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:55,136
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Aww!

1338
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,096
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1339
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:59,349
- Thank you so much for everything.
- Take care. Give my love to your mother.

1340
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:01,726
Love you, cousin. I'll miss you.

1341
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,483
<i>That was "Running Away" by Tunay na Amo.</i>

1342
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:13,863
Our next song is from a new group
called A Band Named Tessa.

1343
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:16,658
<i>And, uh, this is from their self-titled…</i>

1344
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:18,368
Oh, here we go!

1345
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:20,620
<i>I'm gonna play a song</i>
<i>called "I'm Yours, You're Mine."</i>

1346
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,871
Hey, Ma, did you hear that?

1347
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,707
- What now?
- They're playing Entoy's song.

1348
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,000
- Huh? Really?
- Mm-hmm!

1349
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,502
- This is Entoy? How about that!
- This one! Listen, listen.

1350
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,130
I've been given a note.

1351
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:37,554
The inspiration behind this song
was the one and only Lorina.

1352
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,850
<i>You're the one who said… </i>

1353
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,398
- Dong? Dong!
- What is it?

1354
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:49,482
- Dong!
- What?

1355
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,192
That's Entoy singing.

1356
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:55,113
- Oh! Oh. Hit record.
- How?

1357
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,198
- Uh, you have to press the buttons.
- Uh, you do it.

1358
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,117
- No, I forgot how.
- What do you mean?

1359
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,619
- Quickly!
- Uh… Uh… Which one?

1360
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,038
Press those ones.

1361
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:08,501
<i>Why do you pull away </i>

1362
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:10,920
<i>Whenever I come close? </i>

1363
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,631
- You hear that? It's dedicated to her!
- Oh, Lorina!

1364
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,925
- Yeah, that's right.
- Uh, hey, Mister, did you hear that?

1365
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:19,012
- Lorina was just sitting in the back!
- That's my cousin! That's my cousin!

1366
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:22,057
Just this candy, please.

1367
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,391
Thank you.

1368
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:32,025
<i>Don't they know </i>

1369
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:38,490
<i>That we made a vow </i>

1370
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:44,329
<i>That I am yours </i>

1371
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:50,710
<i>And you are mine alone </i>

1372
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,427
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU NO MATTER HOW LONG

1373
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,387
I AM YOURS AND YOU ARE MINE

01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:06,351
<i>Whatever happens </i>

1375
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,483
<i>My love is yours forever </i>

1376
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,904
<i>And whatever it is… </i>

1377
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:19,906
Miss? Miss! Your candy!

1378
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:22,909
<i>Last call</i>
<i>for passengers bound for San Francisco.</i>

1379
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:25,787
<i>Please proceed</i>
<i>to boarding gate number four.</i>

1380
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:31,376
Miss? Excuse me, but can I go first?
It's an emergency. Is that okay?

1381
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,586
- Oh, okay, sure.
- Thank you so much.

1382
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,678
<i>Even if I'm gone… </i>

1383
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:46,766
<i>I'll be waiting in heaven… </i>

1384
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:52,730
Hello?

1385
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:54,566
<i>Hello, Ben?</i>

1386
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:56,943
Ben, is Entoy home?

1387
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,155
Sorry, Entoy's not here.
He's out of town.

1388
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,906
Can I take a message?

1389
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,617
Please ask him to wait for me.

1390
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,703
I'll come back to him.

1391
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:09,414
<i>Tell him I'll come back.</i>

1392
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,417
Tell him I'm sorry for everything.

1393
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,670
<i>Last call</i>
<i>for passengers bound for San Francisco.</i>

1394
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:18,423
<i>Please proceed</i>
<i>to boarding gate number four.</i>

1395
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,718
<i>Please tell him to wait for me.</i>

1396
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:26,931
Please tell him
that I love him so much and I'll return.

1397
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:28,933
I'll tell him.

1398
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:35,899
<i>And you are mine </i>

1399
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:51,372
- Okay, you're good to go.
- Thank you.

1400
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:59,088
What can I get you? One CD?
Here you go. Next!

1401
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:02,175
<i>I have some special guests</i>
<i>in the studio today.</i>

1402
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:05,720
Let me introduce A Band Named Tessa!

1403
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,349
<i>So how does it feel to be famous?</i>

1404
01:27:09,432 --> 01:27:12,101
- <i>It's awesome!</i>
- So sick!

1405
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,478
Thank you, everyone!

1406
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,105
A Band Named Tessa!

1407
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,817
<i>I'm soaring now Adrift among the clouds</i>

1408
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,570
<i>Do you want to?</i>

1409
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:26,658
Thanks so much. Thanks a lot.
Thank you. Thanks.

1410
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:32,205
<i>Do you want to?</i>

1411
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:34,040
<i>Do you want to?</i>

1412
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:34,958
Ely.

1413
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:37,919
You're gonna be the opening band
for Bon Jovi!

1414
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:39,504
Nice work!

1415
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:40,672
Bon Jovi?

1416
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,048
Bon Jovi?!

1417
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:43,716
Seriously?

1418
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,094
- A Band Named Tessa!
- A Band Named Tessa!

1419
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,388
I'M YOURS, YOU'RE MINE
BY A BAND NAMED TESSA

1420
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,058
Whoo! Everyone good?

1421
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:53,601
I love you guys!

1422
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:57,397
- Okay. We're down to our last song.
- More! More! More! More!

1423
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,733
And, uh, this next one
is very special to me.

1424
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,819
Can anyone guess what it is?

1425
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:06,572
"I'm Yours, You're Mine!"

1426
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,032
Sing along if you know it.

1427
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,118
- Yeah!
- It goes like this.

1428
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:27,635
- I love you, Entoy!
- Love you!

1429
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:31,597
<i>You're the one who said </i>

1430
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:39,230
<i>That you love me too </i>

1431
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:45,111
<i>And you promised </i>

1432
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:51,451
<i>Your love would never change </i>

1433
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:58,708
<i>But why do you pull away </i>

1434
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:01,502
<i>Whenever I come close? </i>

1435
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:10,970
<i>My heart breaks </i>

1436
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:14,390
<i>Each time you're with someone else </i>

1437
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:22,065
<i>Don't they know </i>

1438
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:28,529
<i>That we made a vow </i>

1439
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:33,993
<i>That I'm yours </i>

1440
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:40,750
<i>And you're mine </i>

1441
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,734
Dad, I brought you your favorite.

1442
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:09,570
Eat up while it's still hot.

1443
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,949
You forgot to take your medicine.

1444
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:14,575
Dad.

1445
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,018
<i>Entoy.</i>

1446
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:42,728
<i>I know…</i>

1447
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,358
<i>that I didn't support your band</i>
<i>in the beginning.</i>

1448
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:53,197
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>that there was any future in it.</i>

1449
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,408
<i>But I should have believed in you.</i>

1450
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,078
<i>I want to say I'm sorry.</i>

1451
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:02,290
<i>I didn't try to understand you.</i>

1452
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:06,711
<i>And I was too embarrassed</i>
<i>to admit that I was wrong.</i>

1453
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:10,756
But, son,

1454
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:15,178
that doesn't mean
that I don't love you with all my heart.

1455
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:18,890
I love you so much, son.

1456
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:21,601
<i>You and your mother.</i>

1457
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:26,981
<i>I'm so proud of you. </i>

1458
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:30,526
<i>I know I let you and your mom down.</i>

1459
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,405
<i>That's what I regret most.</i>

1460
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:38,659
I wish…

1461
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:43,498
that I could have given you more time
with your mother.

1462
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:47,960
I like to think that… surely…

1463
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:52,673
surely I got something right…

1464
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:59,013
…with everything that you've achieved now.

1465
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,018
Don't forget, Entoy,

1466
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:08,773
nothing is forever in this world.

1467
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,736
But that doesn't mean

1468
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:17,532
that we should give up
on the people we love.

1469
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:23,829
Find your own place in the world, Entoy.

1470
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:31,587
I love you so much, son.

1471
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:42,181
<i>If all things </i>

1472
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:47,937
<i>Must come to an end </i>

1473
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:52,775
<i>This journey </i>

1474
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:58,114
<i>Will lead to its destination </i>

1475
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:03,202
<i>And when you go </i>

1476
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:08,666
<i>The only gift I leave </i>

1477
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:15,172
<i>Is love </i>

1478
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:37,403
<i>Maybe I shouldn't </i>

1479
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:44,201
<i>King of hesitation… </i>

1480
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,663
- Have something to eat.
- Huh? Thank you, Mom.

1481
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:52,168
- You take such good care of me.
- Of course, hon.

1482
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:53,878
Hmm.

1483
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:57,840
- Honey.
- Hm?

1484
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:02,637
I was wondering if you… miss singing?

1485
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:07,683
Not really.

1486
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:13,522
I'm pretty happy just jamming,
doing karaoke sometimes, but, um…

1487
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,232
I don't seek it out.

1488
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,026
Okay, if that's what you want.

1489
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:19,820
Don't you have work?
Aren't you gonna be late again?

1490
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:24,909
- All right, I'll get going.
- Mm-hmm.

1491
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:28,454
Honestly, sometimes it feels
like you're my mother.

1492
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:30,873
- Okay then.
- Okay. Hm?

1493
01:34:30,956 --> 01:34:32,208
- See you later.
- See you later.

1494
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,292
- Love you.
- Love you.

1495
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,048
<i>I don’t want someone so shy </i>

1496
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:42,051
<i>I don’t want someone so shy </i>

1497
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:49,975
<i>I don’t want someone so shy</i>
<i>But I like you</i>

1498
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:58,109
You okay?

1499
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:01,362
- I'm okay, yeah.
- Hey, Mom. Over there.

1500
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:06,367
- Ah, hello! Good evening. Hi.
- Let me take that.

1501
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:07,910
- Sure. Thank you.
- No problem.

1502
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:12,039
Where are we?

1503
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:16,001
Uh, Mister, where are we going?

1504
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,545
We're going there.

1505
01:35:20,005 --> 01:35:23,676
Mom! It's a billboard for Lyn-Lyn!

1506
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:27,304
I mean Jo-C.
Wow, is that where we're headed?

1507
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:31,434
Yeah! I spoke to Ester earlier.
We're heading straight there.

1508
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:34,145
Oh, look at Lyn-Lyn!

1509
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:38,274
Oh, why didn't you tell me?
We could have got dressed up.

1510
01:35:38,357 --> 01:35:40,818
- No need. It's not necessary.
- Mom!

1511
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,654
I'm so happy for Lyn-Lyn.

1512
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,156
- Can you believe it?
- What?

1513
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,908
The welcome we're getting!

1514
01:35:49,368 --> 01:35:51,287
- Auntie!
- Oh, I have to go. I have to go.

1515
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:53,914
- Hi! Welcome back!
- Hey!

1516
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,792
- Sis, welcome back!
- You've hit the big time, Aunt Ester!

1517
01:35:56,876 --> 01:36:00,838
Don't be ridiculous,
but I am now managing Jo-C.

1518
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,882
Ah, so, sis, is this him?

1519
01:36:03,632 --> 01:36:07,636
My sister, Ester, and my fiancé, Greg.

1520
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,140
- Oh, Greg! Hi! Nice to finally meet you.
- Hello!

1521
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:13,976
Nice to meet you too, Ester.

1522
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:16,312
- Uh, are we ready? Let's take our seats.
- This way, please.

1523
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:17,354
Uh, Lorina.

1524
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:20,983
- She'll take you to Lyn-Lyn. All right.
- How exciting! I'll see you later then.

1525
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:22,193
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1526
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,527
- Right this way, please.
- Thanks.

1527
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:31,285
Thank you all so much
for being here with me tonight.

1528
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:36,373
It makes me so happy to be able
to share this moment with you.

1529
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:41,086
I'd like to thank my supporters
and all of my loved ones.

1530
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:44,006
Without you, I wouldn't be here.

1531
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:49,011
And there's someone special
I want to thank tonight,

1532
01:36:49,094 --> 01:36:55,017
who's always been there
to guide me and to support me

1533
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:59,271
from the very beginning and to this day,

1534
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:01,148
and that's my mom.

1535
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,237
Ma, thank you so much.

1536
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:09,323
My next single is a cover.

1537
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:12,535
This song was a huge hit in the '90s.
I hope you enjoy it.

1538
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:30,928
<i>You're the one who said </i>

1539
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:38,811
<i>That you love me too </i>

1540
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,817
<i>And you promised </i>

1541
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:52,408
<i>Your love would never change </i>

1542
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:56,203
<i>But why </i>

1543
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:59,540
<i>Do you pull away </i>

1544
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:02,209
<i>Whenever I come close? </i>

1545
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:12,261
<i>My heart breaks </i>

1546
01:38:12,344 --> 01:38:16,056
<i>Each time you're with someone else </i>

<i>That I am yours </i>

1550
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:44,376
<i>And you are mine </i>

1551
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:50,090
Now, let's all give
a warm round of applause

1552
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:53,344
to the inspiration
behind this hit '90s song,

1553
01:38:53,969 --> 01:38:56,805
the one and only Miss Lorina Dominguez!

1554
01:38:56,889 --> 01:39:00,517
- This way, ma'am. Let's go.
- Huh? But I'm not prepared. No. I--

1555
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,147
Welcome back, cousin.

1556
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:07,232
You got this!

1557
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:47,231
- Lorina!
- Uh-huh? Dad?

1558
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,152
So you won't get nervous.

1559
01:39:53,904 --> 01:39:56,865
Remember, I'm always here for you.

1560
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:01,036
- Thank you.
- <i>Lorina Dominguez.</i>

1561
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:03,974
<i>No matter what happens </i>

1562
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:12,274
<i>My love will always be yours </i>

1563
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:18,530
<i>And no matter </i>

1564
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:24,578
<i>What they say, you'll still be the one </i>

1565
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:28,749
<i>I adore </i>

1566
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:35,756
<i>I will wait for you forever </i>

1567
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:42,429
<i>Even if </i>

1568
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:49,228
<i>Forever leads me to the sky </i>

1569
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:57,236
<i>And if I can't find you there </i>

1570
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:04,243
<i>I'll beg the heavens </i>

1571
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,330
<i>To find you </i>

1572
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:11,542
<i>And tell you </i>

1573
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:15,838
<i>Remind you </i>

1574
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:22,928
<i>Of our forgotten vows </i>

1575
01:42:26,765 --> 01:42:30,269
<i>That I'm yours </i>

1576
01:42:30,352 --> 01:42:37,317
<i>And you're mine </i>

1577
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:52,749
Cousin. There's someone to see you.

1578
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:58,714
Entoy?

1579
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:03,969
<i>So trust… </i>

1580
01:43:04,052 --> 01:43:05,637
Entoy!

1581
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:08,223
<i>That I will wait </i>

1582
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,434
<i>No matter how long…</i>

1583
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:11,685
Entoy.

1584
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:17,983
<i>Even if </i>

1585
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:20,402
<i>Forever leads me to…</i>

1586
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:22,946
Didn't you ask me to wait for you?

1587
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,240
Mm-hmm.

1588
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,034
Well, I waited.

1589
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:33,874
<i>And if I can't find you </i>

1590
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:41,048
<i>I'll plead to the heavens </i>

1591
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:44,801
<i>To find you </i>

1592
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:47,429
<i>And tell you </i>

1593
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:51,892
<i>Remind you </i>

1594
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:58,982
<i>Of our forgotten vows </i>

1595
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:06,156
<i>That I'm yours </i>

1596
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:11,203
<i>And you're mine </i>

1597
01:44:11,286 --> 01:44:17,960
<i>Forever </i>

1598
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,216
Lorina.

1599
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:27,052
I have a question.

1600
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:28,136
What is it?

1601
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,182
Where are you at with your plan now?

1602
01:44:33,475 --> 01:44:35,435
Have you done what you wanted to do?

1603
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,021
Uh-huh.

1604
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:40,232
I think I have.

1605
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:41,984
Hm.

1606
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:48,865
Would it be okay… if we tried my plan?

1607
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:51,243
Plan?

1608
01:44:54,579 --> 01:44:57,916
Bring back the sweetness of our love.

1609
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,044
- Hey! Pick something more recent.
- That song's too old?

1610
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:03,547
- It's super old!
- All right, this one's more recent.

1611
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,048
Oh yeah?

1612
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:08,885
This guy is in love with you, buddy.

1613
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:12,931
Are you saying I'm a guy? You idiot.

1614
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:14,433
No way.

1615
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,811
I'm saying I'm so happy.

1616
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:20,272
My forever has finally arrived.

1617
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:23,150
Because you are my world.

1618
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:26,653
Mmm.

1619
01:45:28,196 --> 01:45:30,490
<i>The world is confusing</i>…

1620
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,200
I missed you, my love.

1621
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:35,620
<i>The one you love is the one</i>
<i>Who doesn’t love you back</i>…

1622
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:37,706
And I missed you.

1623
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:43,003
<i>I hope this love I have for you</i>
<i>Isn’t wasted </i>

1624
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:44,755
- Are you hungry?
- Starving.

1625
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:48,717
- Let's eat. You still owe me barbecue.
- Ah. All right. Isaw?

1626
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,761
- Yeah!
- You're on.

1627
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,429
- Siomeow?
- Siomeow?

1628
01:45:53,805 --> 01:46:00,729
<i>Even if the world disappears</i>…

1629
01:46:00,812 --> 01:46:04,274
Wow, look at Mr. Fancy Lawyer over here.

1630
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,109
- I think it suits me.
- Looking sharp.

1631
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:07,819
OD, what's up?

1632
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:11,406
- We're having our fourth baby already!
- Your fourth one?

1633
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:13,825
What's happening with Iggy?

1634
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:15,452
- Hey, look, there he is.
- Hey!

1635
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:16,495
Sup?

1636
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:19,039
- How are you? Been a long time.
- Where you been?

1637
01:46:19,122 --> 01:46:21,416
Sorry I'm late. We came from practice.

1638
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,044
- Guys, my bandmate. This is Samantha.
- Hey, guys.

1639
01:46:24,127 --> 01:46:25,921
- Hello!
- Hello.

1640
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:30,842
- Uh, Sam, this is OD, Sherilyn, Francis.
- Excuse me.

1641
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:32,761
- Hello, Francis.
- Entoy, and this here…

1642
01:46:32,844 --> 01:46:33,762
- Hi.
- Hi, Entoy.

1643
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:35,013
- …is Lorina.
- Lorina.

1644
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:37,182
- Nice to meet you.
- I have heard so much, Lorina.

1645
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:39,434
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- What have you heard?

1646
01:46:39,518 --> 01:46:41,978
Oh, Iggy told me you're the reason

1647
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:45,357
that they replaced Regine
in the concert, right?

1648
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,275
- Oh damn!
- Hey, what's going on?

1649
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:48,402
Huh?

1650
01:46:49,027 --> 01:46:52,114
Everyone's seen the program
for the concert.

1651
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:54,491
Even your mom's seen it.

1652
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:57,702
Are you planning my life again?

1653
01:46:58,203 --> 01:46:59,955
You don't want me to?

1654
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:07,838
Of course I do!
Our plans are about to come true!

1655
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,674
Phew!

1656
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:36,950
<i>She's sitting in a dark corner</i>

1657
01:47:39,202 --> 01:47:45,959
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>Out of thousands of women there</i>

1658
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:52,674
<i>In less than a minute, I fell for you</i>

1659
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:03,518
<i>I want to hear your voice</i>

1660
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:10,275
<i>And hoping I'd touch your hand</i>

1661
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:15,030
<i>I want to come closer to you</i>

1662
01:48:15,113 --> 01:48:21,286
<i>If not for the man you're with</i>

1663
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:32,380
<i>Bring me to your palace</i>

1664
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:40,013
<i>And let's walk</i>
<i>In the garden of your kingdom</i>

1665
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:42,516
<i>I may not have anything</i>

1666
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:49,356

<i>I can't sleep</i>

1672
01:49:23,515 --> 01:49:27,602
<i>I keep thinking of that sparkle</i>
<i>In your eyes</i>

1673
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:32,857
<i>You're in my mind</i>
<i>The whole morning, the whole night</i>

1674
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,736
<i>I wish I can see you all the time</i>

1675
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:41,616
<i>Oh, it hurts to think this is a dream</i>

1676
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:46,746
<i>Just a dream</i>

1677
01:49:47,956 --> 01:49:54,713
<i>Bring me to your palace</i>
