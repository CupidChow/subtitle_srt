00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,860
[Episode 04]

4
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,360
Why are you here?

5
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,259
Didn't you say yesterday that you didn't want to see me?

6
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,190
You didn't keep your word, did you?

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,090
I was going to move out.

8
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,660
But then I thought about it.

9
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,740
Although we are in different time-space,

10
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,940
this is also your home

11
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,490
and you have the right to live your life in your own way.

12
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,410
That's more like it.

13
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,620
Besides, we are still in the adjustment period of cohabitation,

14
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,210
so it is normal for us to have conflicts.

15
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,380
It's not cohabitation. We're just roommates.

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,690
Yeah, roommates.

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,940
So

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,520
you're okay with me staying here?

19
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,340
You don't need to ask my permission.

20
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,670
I'm not the house owner.

21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,210
Since we're roommates,

22
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,790
why don't we have dinner together?

23
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,970
He Zhengyu,

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,900
what do you want?

25
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,860
I just want to have an informal dinner with you.

26
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,950
An informal dinner?

27
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,810
You call this an informal dinner?

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,270
I don't believe you would be so nice to me

29
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,070
for no reason.

30
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,750
Tell me, what do you want?

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,100
You're overthinking it.

32
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,590
I am just trying to

33
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,230
live in peace with you.

34
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,790
Would you really be so nice?

35
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,940
I don't believe you.

36
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,430
Look.

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,120
You misunderstood me.

38
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,300
I would also like to take this opportunity

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,829
to get familiar with you

40
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,220
to facilitate our future life.

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,910
Am I right?

42
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,230
Please have a seat.

43
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't like these.

44
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,540
You can tell me

45
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,650
what you like.

46
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,100
Haven't you eaten Liuzhou river snails rice noodle before?

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,990
No.

48
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,060
This is similar to

49
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,920
cooking instant noodles, right?

50
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,460
Okay, leave it to me.

51
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,329
By the way,

52
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,420
please add a fried egg to the soup for me.

53
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,750
And it would be nice to have a chicken claw.

54
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,910
It seems he really hasn't tried this before.

55
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,790
I just confirmed that

56
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,480
it indeed smells like this.

57
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,220
There are still some over there.

58
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,100
Do you want to try?

59
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,620
No.

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,620
I'll pass.

61
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,170
Okay.

62
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,840
I can go to the study if you don't like the smell.

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,480
No, no.

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,130
It's okay.

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Just eat here.

66
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,500
All right.

67
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,990
The steak...

68
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,120
You really don't want to try it?

69
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,950
It's alright. I'm full.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
-I'm off to work now. -You...

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,940
What?

72
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,070
Nothing, just go ahead.

73
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,940
Li Zili had just been fired by Fei's Company,

74
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,990
and Li Ziqiang sued Fei's Company for forced demolition and beating.

75
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,990
My name is Li Zili.

76
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,950
As far as I know,

77
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,970
you also worked for Fei's Company before, right?

78
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,530
Yes.

79
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,110
Please listen to me, miss.

80
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,160
Fei's Company

81
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,580
not only maliciously lowers the compensation

82
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,020
during the demolition process,

83
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,560
but also uses force to retaliate against people. They beat up my brother.

84
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,140
I was expelled because I couldn't stand what they were doing

85
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,960
and didn't want to join them.

86
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,140
Could this be a coincidence?

87
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,030
May I come in, Chen Jialan?

88
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

89
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,770
I'm just looking for something.

90
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,830
It won't take long.

91
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,050
Hurry up, then.

92
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,940
Where is it?

93
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,500
I remember it was right here.

94
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,860
Just hurry up.

95
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,220
Don't disturb my work.

96
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,330
It might be there.

97
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,370
Where is it?

98
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,590
Did I put it on the table?

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,790
Isn't this Jiang Shenghao?

100
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,040
You know him?

101
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,140
What does it matter to you

102
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,200
if I know him or not?

103
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,140
You know him?

104
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,200
Of course.

105
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,310
Wu Jirong is my good friend,

106
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,460
and Jiang Shenghao is her husband.

107
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,110
So Rat's proposal was successful.

108
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,880
And they soon got a marriage certificate.

109
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,049
But generally people

110
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,500
who get married quickly

111
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,320
tend to get divorced quickly.

112
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,480
Why do you have to

113
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,950
think that way?

114
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,580
Are you really Jirong's good friend?

115
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,820
You must be an anti-fan.

116
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,350
I'm just telling the truth.

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
Our law firm

118
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,880
handles several of these cases every year.

119
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,780
You lawyers

120
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,700
just want everyone to get divorced

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,170
so that you can make money.

122
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,030
I'm telling you this

123
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,910
because you know Jiang Shenghao.

124
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,180
No need.

125
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,860
But...

126
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,180
Have you found your stuff yet?

127
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,780
Please get out if you're done.

128
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,350
Wu Jirong is my good friend.

129
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,060
I have no reason to curse her.

130
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,710
She's a superstar.

131
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,740
Information about her can be found online.

132
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,030
Stop pretending.

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,540
I really know her.

134
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,840
Then do you know this?

135
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,070
Chen Jialan, I...

136
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,340
Get out.

137
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,660
Wait...

138
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,330
Don't bother me.

139
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,470
So annoying.

140
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,660
I haven't found my stuff yet.

141
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,050
You're really annoying.

142
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,580
I haven't found my stuff...

143
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,120
Why is she so difficult to get along with?

144
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,590
Here are the details of the whole event.

145
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,820
According to Li Ziqiang,

146
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,040
it was indeed Fei Meng

147
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,070
who ordered his men to beat him up at that time.

148
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,580
And the hospital's diagnostic certificate also showed that

149
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
his arm was indeed

150
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,260
a comminuted fracture

151
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,650
caused by the blow of external force.

152
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,160
And he also had a slight concussion.

153
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
The case of Fei's Company's forced demolition and beating

154
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,920
has sparked widespread social concern.

155
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,670
We must pay attention to

156
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,880
the accuracy of the information now.

157
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,690
Any questions?

158
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,770
Ms. Wen,

159
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,300
I have an idea.

160
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,210
Please go ahead.

161
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,650
The leader of the disturbance outside the Fei's Company building that day

162
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,410
was named Li Zili,

163
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,360
who is the brother of Li Ziqiang.

164
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,570
According to what he said,

165
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,040
he was fired by Fei's Company

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,250
because he couldn't stand

167
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,570
their behavior.

168
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,110
But I went to Fei's Company to investigate

169
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,210
and I found out that he and his construction team were fired

170
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,190
before the demolition.

171
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,960
So I suspect there is something else behind this incident.

172
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,220
What Li Zili did

173
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,420
was to defend his rights against the dismissal of Fei's Company employees.

174
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,030
It has nothing to do with Fei Meng beating people, does it?

175
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,760
Besides,

176
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,620
public opinions are now on the side of the Li brothers.

177
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,060
But the duty of journalists is to disclose the truth

178
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,540
and tell the public the truth.

179
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,820
If we just pander to

180
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,850
the netizens' speculation

181
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,840
and only report the story they want to see,

182
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,210
wouldn't that defeat

183
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,980
our original purpose?

184
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,770
Chen Jialan,

185
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,380
is what you are saying your own speculation,

186
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,240
or have you found solid evidence?

187
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,670
This is just my suspicion for now.

188
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,760
I haven't found the evidence yet.

189
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,710
I want to say one more thing.

190
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,630
I did find a lot of suspicions

191
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,780
during the interview with Li Ziqiang.

192
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,920
But I didn't find any conclusive evidence either.

193
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,750
And since the Fei's Company case will soon go to trial,

194
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,590
I want to

195
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,620
see the outcome of the trial first.

196
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,540
But since Chen Jialan mentioned it just now,

197
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,000
it shows that she has a good sensitivity of news.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,590
How about

199
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,430
we report these two stories separately for now?

200
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,170
Chen Jialan and I will follow up the connection

201
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,770
between these two things.

202
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay, just do as you say.

203
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
That's all for today.

204
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,040
You're dismissed.

205
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,880
Awesome, Chen Jialan.

206
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,050
Even Mr. Mu wanted to work with you.

207
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,160
He's a maverick.

208
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,600
It's great that you got his approval.

209
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,530
Mr. Mu, I will try my best

210
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,470
to live up to your expectations.

211
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,390
I'm sure you can do it.

212
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,550
Okay.

213
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,430
Brother.

214
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,050
I found Chen Kexin.

215
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,770
Send me your location.

216
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,490
Where is she?

217
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Let's go meet her.

218
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,690
What do you want?

219
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,800
Hello, Miss Chen.

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,090
We won't take you long.

221
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,820
It's just that we would like to confirm some questions

222
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,550
about Jiang Shenghao with you.

223
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,180
No need.

224
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,180
Jiang Shenghao is just a jerk.

225
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,460
He was already with me

226
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,980
but he didn't want to divorce Wu Jirong.

227
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,670
What happened in the apartment that night

228
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,260
was just like what you think.

229
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,320
I made it very clear

230
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,420
when I cooperated with the investigation.

231
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,670
As for the rest, I have no comment.

232
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,300
Please stop bothering me in the future.

233
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,620
Miss Chen, please don't get us wrong.

234
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
Here is the thing.

235
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Jiang Shenghao

236
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,770
said in court that you perjured.

237
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,270
We hope to find more conclusive evidence

238
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,900
that he cheated after marriage.

239
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,740
When this case goes to trial again,

240
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
we would like you to testify

241
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,420
and be questioned by the judge.

242
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,350
It'll be more helpful for the case.

243
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,320
I don't mind testifying in court.

244
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,590
But there is a long story

245
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,860
between me and Jiang Shenghao.

246
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,860
Excuse me.

247
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,960
I'd like to go to the bathroom.

248
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,180
Sir.

249
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,230
There's a bathroom over there.

250
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,020
Chen Kexin!

251
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,590
What are you stopping me for?

252
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,050
Wait...

253
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,260
What's going on?

254
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,750
Sorry.

255
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,370
That lady said

256
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,300
she didn't know you

257
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,680
and asked us for help.

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,060
Please forgive us.

259
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,370
Can't you see that we know each other?

260
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,570
You can go to the bar if you need to order.

261
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,120
If you verbally harass

262
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,850
our female customers again...

263
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,120
Harass?

264
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,670
Alright.

265
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,390
Let's go.

266
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,820
We finally found her,

267
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,160
but she just ran away.

268
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,020
What do you mean by run away?

269
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,290
We were just asking her some questions,

270
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,750
not arresting criminals.

271
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,900
But we didn't

272
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,530
get any useful information.

273
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,760
No.

274
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,080
We've found a lot.

275
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,720
What?

276
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,740
We just

277
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,460
questioned her normally

278
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,390
but she ran away.

279
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,810
Running away means exposure.

280
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,580
Because there's something

281
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,160
she doesn't want us to know about,

282
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,650
and it's closely tied to the case.

283
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,040
But it's going to be hard to find her again.

284
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,520
Don't worry. You got me.

285
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,140
Jialan,

286
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,900
why don't they get their own coffee

287
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,870
but have to ask you to help them?

288
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,390
They are quite busy.

289
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,480
It's not a big deal.

290
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,020
Mr. Mu had never worked with anyone before,

291
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,280
yet he worked with her.

292
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,080
The cake was quite ugly.

293
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,800
I just threw it in the trash.

294
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:07,880
Me too.

295
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,070
I didn't take a bite.

296
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,360
Well,

297
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,190
did she leave early for dinner that day

298
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,350
to find Mr. Mu?

299
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,370
Of course.

300
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,040
She was in a hurry that day...

301
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,200
It is your freedom

302
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,380
to throw away the things people give you.

303
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,740
But I can't stand

304
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,270
you speaking ill of others.

305
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,350
I seem to have a manuscript that I haven't finished yet.

306
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,910
Right.

307
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,780
You are just too kind.

308
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,140
It's okay. Thank you, Piaopiao.

309
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm off to go.

310
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,300
Whatever Chen Jialan is going to do tonight...

311
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,070
Even if she treats the house like a garbage dump,

312
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,330
I have to put up with it.

313
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,339
Because I need her to help me make an appointment with Jirong.

314
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,579
Remember.

315
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,520
Smile.

316
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,090
Luckily I got my fist under control.

317
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,760
What are you walking around for?

318
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,330
Go away.

319
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,350
Remember, smile.

320
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,780
Thank you.

321
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,630
Chen Jialan.

322
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,690
Would you please...

323
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,130
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

324
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,790
Can't you see I'm in a bad mood?

325
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,480
I know.

326
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,250
Then you indeed need to vent it.

327
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,630
I am venting it.

328
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,780
I have an idea

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,860
to make you feel better in a minute.

330
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,940
So cold.

331
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,180
It's winter here.

332
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,420
Wear more when you come out next time.

333
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,150
No need.

334
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,020
Okay, thank you.

335
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,430
Thank you.

336
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,770
It's so good.

337
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,190
Do you want to try it?

338
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,630
I don't eat sweet.

339
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,190
You are such a poser.

340
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,210
What's wrong with me?

341
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,270
Childish.

342
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,020
Now that you're eating cake,

343
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,840
I have something...

344
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,770
Answer me first.

345
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,860
Where did you get the equipment?

346
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,860
What does it have to do with you?

347
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,340
Can't I just ask you?

348
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,970
How dare you come back?

349
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,220
I'll kill you today.

350
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,980
After learning that you know martial arts,

351
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,440
I deliberately went to buy a set of equipment

352
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,730
to protect myself.

353
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,990
Martial arts?

354
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,350
Were the moves you used

355
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,280
learned from taekwondo videos?

356
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
And what I learned was not martial arts,

357
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,450
but mixed martial arts.

358
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Do you want to try?

359
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,140
No.

360
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,860
I can't tell the difference anyway.

361
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,630
Look at you.

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,050
How can you

363
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,710
be so violent every day?

364
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,400
You usually look quite normal.

365
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,930
How come you're actually a slick-haired scum?

366
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,980
If I were a scum,

367
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,130
would I buy you a cake?

368
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,060
Since you have already eaten the cake.

369
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,970
Don't say anything about this cake.

370
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,460
It was because of this cake.

371
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,210
I worked so hard

372
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,220
to make them cakes for so long

373
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,940
and they said the cakes were ugly.

374
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,220
They seem to be right.

375
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,820
He Zhengyu!

376
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,710
Is that what you're mad about?

377
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,550

378
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,110
I've already treated them to dinner.

379
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,210
I... I got to be a journalist

380
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
because of my hard work.

381
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,700
I merely

382
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,230
left dinner a little early.

383
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,820
Did they have to discredit me like that?

384
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,660
Left early?

385
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,320
I did it all because of Rat,

386
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,420
also known as Jiang Shenghao.

387
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,590
He told me to leave.

388
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,590
Are you close to Jiang Shenghao?

389
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,030
Stop.

390
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,300
Don't try to

391
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,820
get any gossip from me.

392
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,850
I won't tell you.

393
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:57,840
Fine.

394
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,550
I won't ask.

395
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,660
Where were we?

396
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,360
Let's go on.

397
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
The workplace...

398
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,300
The workplace is a... The workplace is a small society.

399
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,660
We don't need to do ineffective socialization,

400
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,300
but we can't be socially inactive either.

401
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,620
We still need to maintain the necessary relationships.

402
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,880
Is that you want to say?

403
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,080
You know all these.

404
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,180
I do.

405
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,620
But Rat is my best friend.

406
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,750
He is indeed more important than those ineffective social interactions.

407
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,120
I didn't expect you to be quite principled.

408
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,400
Of course.

409
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,430
There.

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,730
Cream.

411
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,440
I have a handkerchief in my pocket.

412
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,300
You can wipe it.

413
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,970
So troublesome.

414
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,130
What are you doing?

415
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,620
This is my coat.

416
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,300
I have a handkerchief in my pocket.

417
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,640
You can wipe it with that handkerchief.

418
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,840
Don't.

420
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,660
I'm sorry.

421
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,540
I'll clean it for you.

422
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,190
Let me clean it for you.

423
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,740
Stop, stop, stop.

424
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,650
Fine, it's okay.

425
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,920
It doesn't matter.

426
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,500
It's too late now.

427
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,290
It's okay.

428
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,460
No.

429
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,570
I can't take your clothes with me.

430
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,280
Are you tired?

431
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,410
I'm fine.

432
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,810
Look. What is she doing?

433
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,760
She's so weird.

434
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,650
Let's go.

435
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,260
Of course it's true.

436
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,360
Every stain on my clothes can prove it.

437
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,910
I'll clean it tomorrow.

438
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,440
It didn't work out tonight.

439
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
I'll have to get this done tomorrow.

440
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,350
What exactly did he want to ask me for?

441
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:43,960
Come in.

442
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,630
Ms. Wen, what's the matter?

443
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,140
Fei's Company will hold a press conference

444
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,180
in two hours.

445
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,180
He Zhengyu will also attend

446
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,040
as an attorney.

447
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,900
Mu Shiming has something else to do.

448
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,920
You and Liu Da go to the press conference first.

449
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,990
Their attorney is He Zhengyu?

450
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,620
You know him?

451
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,470
No.

452
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,990
I'll be right there.

453
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,840
Did he move there

454
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,730
because of Fei's Company's case?

455
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,060
I firmly believe that the existence of the law

456
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,300
-is to maintain justice... -He Zhengyu!

457
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,140
-How much money did you take from Fei's Company? -Are you seeking a victory

458
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,020
for fairness and justice

459
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,910
or a victory for rich clients?

460
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
What happened?

461
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,350
My memory

462
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,790
has changed again.

463
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,220
Mr. He is here.

464
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,020
Mr. He is here.

465
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,920
[September 22, 2021]
[4:00 p.m., Fei's Company]

466
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,050
Mr. He,

467
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,020
may I ask why

468
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,620
you chose to be the attorney for Fei's Company?

469
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,260
Everyone,

470
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,240
I firmly believe that the existence of the law

471
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,570
is to maintain justice.

472
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,210
So I will spare no effort

473
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,300
to get justice for my client this time.

474
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,820
Mr. He,

475
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,320
aren't you worried that the outcome of this trial

476
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,540
will break your glorious record

477
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,800
of never losing a case?

478
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,820
I never do anything

479
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,880
I'm not sure about,

480
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,460
nor do I fight a lawsuit that I have no chance of winning.

481
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,800
So I will still win this time.

482
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,460
So now you have

483
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,840
enough evidence to turn the tide?

484
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,680
He Zhengyu!

485
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,080
He Zhengyu.

486
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,740
It is an acknowledged fact that

487
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,980
Fei's Company carried out forced demolition and beatings.

488
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,380
How dare you, as a lawyer,

489
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,060
openly defend for the wicked?

490
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,560
Do you have a conscience?

491
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,350
Mr. Li,

492
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,160
this is a public place.

493
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,670
Mind your words.

494
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,550
Otherwise,

495
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,680
I can sue you for slander.

496
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,220
Here.

497
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,920
Everyone, please take a look.

498
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,270
This is my brother's injury examination report,

499
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,200
which clearly states that

500
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,690
-he is a tenth degree disability. -Mr. Li.

501
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,180
Here is not a courtroom.

502
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,940
If you have evidence,

503
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,590
you can show us at the trial.

504
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,980
I will call security

505
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,540
if you disrupt our conference again.

506
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,150
Go ahead.

507
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,390
We didn't do anything wrong anyway.

508
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,700
Security!

509
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,730
Don't touch me!

510
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,960
Don't touch me!

511
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,510
Brother!

512
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,230
Go away.

513
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,390
Are you okay?

514
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:09,990
Brother.

515
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,560
Brother.

516
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,310
Take my hand.

517
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,690
Be careful.

518
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,930
How much money did you take from Fei's Company?

519
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,760
You will be punished for doing so.

520
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,290
First,

521
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,360
the law is about evidence,

522
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,380
not karma.

523
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,180
Secondly,

524
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,490
everyone here

525
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,860
heard what you just said,

526
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,060
so I can sue you at any time.

527
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,980
He Zhengyu!

528
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,260
Mr. He,

529
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,020
I have a question for you.

530
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,890
You are

531
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,730
an undefeated myth in the lawyer world,

532
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,680
and it is normal for you

533
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,770
to defend the legal rights of your clients.

534
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,860
But as far as I know,

535
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,120
all your clients are rich.

536
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
Are you seeking a victory

537
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,060
for fairness and justice

538
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,110
or a victory for rich clients?

539
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,620
That's a good question.

540
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,240
You are the first journalist

541
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,180
to ask me this question

542
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,980
in my many years in the business.

543
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,820
My answer is

544
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,450
neither.

545
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,060
Justice occupies a different place in everyone's heart.

546
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,590
And there is no uniform standard for victory.

547
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,980
As a lawyer,

548
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:30,820
all I can do

549
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,370
is to maintain the justice defined by the law.

550
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,400
I want to remind you, as a reporter,

551
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,900
that your interview

552
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,550
with subjective intent just now

553
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,500
has violated

554
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,360
the spirit of objective and neutral interviewing.

555
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,260
You are right about that.

556
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,700
But as a human being,

557
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,050
one should have the awareness to speak up for the weak.

558
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,450
What do you think, Mr. He?

559
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,750
This is a press conference for Fei's Company,

560
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,010
not the selection of the top ten young people.

561
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,340
What you are talking about is not in the scope of discussion.

562
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,260
He Zhengyu.

563
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,740
You're practicing?

564
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,260
I bought you a cake.

565
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,930
Sweets stimulate dopamine,

566
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,860
which can help you feel better.

567
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,680
I didn't know you four months ago.

568
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,440
I apologize for him.

569
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,960
He Zhengyu,

570
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,750
You've been acting strange these days.

571
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,100
Why do I feel like you've changed?

572
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,070
Really?

573
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,650
I don't think so.

574
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,910
You bought me a cake yesterday.

575
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,260
And today you humbly apologized

576
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,190
for what happened four months ago.

577
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,180
You even bought me another cake.

578
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,250
Something must be wrong.

579
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,820
You also asked me

580
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,380
to do you a favor last night.

581
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,640
What do you want?

582
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,260
Are you still

583
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,380
trying to separate

584
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,590
Jirong and Shenghao?

585
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,860
No way.

586
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,180
Separate? That's not what I meant.

587
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,900
Your thoughts have nothing to do with me.

588
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,700
It's useless.

589
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,010
He Zhengyu,

590
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,720
you didn't get ruined

591
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
because of this case,

592
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,480
did you?

593
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,400
Could you please not use

594
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,650
the word "ruined"?

595
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,650
I did move here

596
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,560
because I lost a lawsuit.

597
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,300
But it wasn't because of the one you're talking about.

598
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,380
I won that one you're mentioning.

599
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,100
You did take the dirty money.

600
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,950
Chen Jialan,

601
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,670
I don't doubt that you have a sense of justice.

602
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,800
But you're using it in the wrong place.

603
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,500
We have all seen Li Ziqiang's injuries.

604
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,580
His injury examination report was also written by the hospital.

605
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,710
How can that be fake?

606
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,480
We did see Li Ziqiang's injuries.

607
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,500
But who saw

608
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,830
the people from Fei's Company beat him up?

609
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,380
You're a lawyer. I can't convince you.

610
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,240
But it doesn't mean you're right.

611
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,150
You may not trust me,

612
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,930
but you should trust the law

613
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,180
and the judge, right?

614
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:42,670
Look.

615
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,060
[Fei's Company won. He Zhengyu maintained his undefeated legacy.]

616
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,420
This is the result, not the evidence.

617
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,170
What other evidence do you want?

618
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,310
In my world,

619
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,730
the jury is still out on this.

620
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,190
I'll figure it out myself.

621
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,420
Chen Jialan.

622
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,350
Don't follow me.

623
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,630
I don't want to see you.

624
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,260
Thank you.

625
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,180
Sir.

626
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,150
Follow that car.

627
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,030
Go, go, go.

628
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,020
Follow him.

629
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,780
Let me ask you.

630
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,020
Do you know where the Li brothers are?

631
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,050
What do you want?

632
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,330
Do you know it or not?

633
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,350
Why is she so mean?

634
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,370
I won't put up with you

635
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,620
if it isn't for

636
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,170
asking Jirong out.

637
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,360
I just thought about it.

638
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,960
You can ask me tomorrow.

639
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,220
I mean the me from four months ago.

640
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,360
I remember that day I went to...

641
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
What is it?

642
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,350
It's really annoying.

643
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,670
Are you that journalist from iNEWS?

644
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,060
How did you know?

645
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,190
Why are you following me?

646
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
Who is following you?

647
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,630
I'm here for coffee.

648
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,730
Ms. Chen.

649
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,410
I have work to do.

650
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,139
Please go have fun elsewhere.

651
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,139
Don't disturb me.

652
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,300
I have work to do too.

653
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,590
So, don't disturb me.

654
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,300
Work?

655
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,699
Are you also here to see Li Zili?

656
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,600
How did you know I was here?

657
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,480
You told me yourself.

658
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,719
Forget it. I'm going to do an interview.

659
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,780
Don't get in my way.

660
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,280
Come back.

661
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,409
What do you want?

662
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,179
Is it a public interview?

663
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,199
If so,

664
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,380
your outfit is too informal.

665
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:33,870
If not,

666
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,260
your outfit is too ostentatious.

667
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,409
What other ideas do you have?

668
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,420
Just follow me

669
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,560
and sit behind me normally.

670
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,260
Remember,

671
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,889
you're not an actor.

672
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,929
You don't need to be so extra.

673
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,030
I'll have two specials and a fruit plate.

674
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,630
Thank you.

675
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,360
Li Zili,

676
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,630
you have to get your brother to keep his mouth shut.

677
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,360
Your coffee.

678
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,240
The defendant's lawyer is not easy to deal with.

679
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,130
We will all be screwed if something happens.

680
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,700
Don't worry.

681
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,480
My brother is very honest.

682
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,390
I've told him.

683
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,830
Then my money...

684
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,050
What money?

685
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,560
Li Zili,

686
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,700
you can't burn the bridge, right?

687
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm not as foolish as your brother.

688
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,960
Don't get me wrong.

689
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,360
I will pay you

690
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,690
once the lawsuit is won and the compensation arrives.

691
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,800
You are really a bastard.

692
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,970
You could even think of self-harm.

693
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,480
I did it because I knew how to win the game.

694
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,070
If he doesn't break his arm,

695
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,360
we won't get the money.

696
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,130
Don't worry.

697
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,110
I'm sorry.

698
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,960
We almost got caught just now.

699
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,520
Li Ziqiang's forensic report has come out.

700
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,950
He fractured the same part twice in a short period of time.

701
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,180
It is likely that the plaintiff

702
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,660
has done a second injury to himself

703
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,570
in order to frame Fei's Company.

704
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,360
Obviously, it wasn't done by Fei's Company.

705
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,660
Journalists have to express facts, not emotions.

706
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,920
Don't make yourself look so amateurish.

707
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,520
Bye.

708
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,110
You didn't pay the bill.

709
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:35,800
Waiter.

710
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,950
Bill, please.

711
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,670
I just paid the bill...

712
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,590
Now it's raining.

713
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,140
I'll have to pay for a taxi.

714
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,390
Get in.

715
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,060
Get in.

716
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,940
Thank you.

717
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,320
Thank you.

718
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,890
Where are you headed?

719
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,550
My company,

720
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,040
iNEWS.

721
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,510
Thank you.

722
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,110
I used to think that

723
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,120
what I saw was real.

724
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,150
But I didn't expect that this case

725
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,770
has proved me wrong.

726
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,200
I heard you never lost a case.

727
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,490
How did you do that?

728
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,180
Because I have a brain.

729
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,180
Thank you for sending me back specially.

730
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,010
You're overthinking it.

731
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,940
It's raining so hard now.

732
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,070
I would do the same thing for everyone.

733
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,670
If you ever find out

734
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,970
how annoying you are right now,

735
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,030
will you regret it?

736
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,440
What do you mean?

737
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,540
Nothing.

738
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,030
Bye.

739
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,420
He Zhengyu?

740
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,710
What are you doing here?

741
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,690
Mr. Mu.

742
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,030
He gave me a ride.

743
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,010
Why are you two together?

744
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,600
When did you become an entertainment reporter?

745
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,380
So gossipy.

746
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,380
You are now the attorney representing Fei Meng.

747
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,460
Your identity is too sensitive.

748
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,720
Jilan is my colleague.

749
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,850
I need to remind her

750
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,870
not to be taken advantage of.

751
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,840
You should indeed do that.

752
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,000
The professional level of your iNEWS staff

753
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,930
needs to be improved.

754
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,790
He Zhengyu!

755
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,700
I can't affect the fairness of the news.

756
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,780
I can only affect

757
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,040
the authenticity of the news you report.

758
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,110
Your hair is all wet.

759
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,150
Dry it.

760
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,720
Don't catch a cold.

761
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,840
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

762
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,960
Let's go.

763
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay.

764
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
By the way, Mr. Mu,

765
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,690
I found Li Zili.

766
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,060
I also recorded some videos.

767
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,660
Let me see.

768
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,320
Are you that journalist from iNEWS?

769
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,250
I did it because I knew how to win the game.

770
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,430
It is likely that the plaintiff has done a second injury to himself...

771
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,270
iNEWS.

772
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,550
Again?

773
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,590
Come on.

774
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,610
It's just a game.

775
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,610
Why would you connect it to reality?

776
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,650
My memory is updated again.

777
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,810
Brother.

778
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,200
Why do you keep repeating this?

779
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,330
Why don't you believe me?

780
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,280
I do.

781
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,120
You are the boss.

782
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,850
I'll believe whatever you say.

783
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,960
Do you remember

784
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,500
the case in which Li Ziqiang framed Fei's Company?

785
00:40:59,500 --> 00:40:59,980
Yes.

786
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,610
His medical report was investigated by me.

787
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,500
Li Zili

788
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,620
was fired from his job

789
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,500
for cutting corners in a construction project.

790
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,110
Fei Meng gave us the evidence.

791
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,730
I personally investigated Li Zili

792
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,550
to make sure everything was in order,

793
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,820
and it turned out that

794
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,060
he was colluding with a mole in Fei's Company

795
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,390
to screw Fei's Company.

796
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,850
Wait...

797
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,040
Didn't we win the case?

798
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,560
Why are you still mentioning it?

799
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,220
My new memory now shows me that

800
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
when I checked on Li Zili,

801
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,750
Chen Jialan was also there.

802
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,770
So cool.

803
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,380
Which one of you does she like more?

804
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,580
Is it you four months ago or is it you now?

805
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,060
It's not like that.

806
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,510
I'm not even sure now

807
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,360
which one of me she hates more.

808
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,950
I guess it's you now.

809
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,480
Get lost.

810
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,700
Now that our relationship is so strained.

811
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,540
She's even less likely to help me ask Jirong out.

812
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,350
You're getting worse.

813
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,650
Why would Chen Jialan

814
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,150
appear in all my new memories?

815
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,610
Is there a pattern to this?

816
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,110
Play the game first.

817
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Don't get us lose.

818
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,700
The ultimate.

819
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,580
Wait, the skill is on cooldown. Wait...

820
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,060
Go! Go! Go!

821
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,140
Chen Jialan!

822
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,240
Chen Jialan?

823
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,690
Chen Jialan?

824
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,820
She didn't stay out on purpose, did she?

825
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,300
It's indeed wise to come back late.

826
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,570
That way I don't have to see that annoying guy.

827
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,500
I can have a quiet environment now.

828
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,140
Chen Jialan, my proposal was successful.

829
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,480
-Come and have dinner with us. -He proposed successfully?

830
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,160
Great!

831
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,180
Chen Jialan,

832
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,970
why are you standing outside sneakily?

833
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,630
Come in.

834
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,500
It's really you.

835
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,930
Ms. Wu.

836
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,320
Ms. Wu?

837
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,500
What are you talking about?

838
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,030
Stop pretending to be a kid.

839
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,380
Just call me Jirong.

840
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,120
Have a seat.

841
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,060
Okay.

842
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,730
Wouldn't it interrupt your work

843
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,810
that we asked you to come over suddenly?

844
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,640
Not at all.

845
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,990
It's my lunch break now.

846
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,620
You're...

847
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,870
You're much prettier than on TV.

848
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,470
Thank you.

849
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,120
Guess what?

850
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,070
This is my wife.

851
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,450
Stop showing off.

852
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,360
Such a big diamond ring!

853
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,410
You must have spent a lot of money, right?

854
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,190
Of course.

855
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,320
This is what I have to do.

856
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,530
Jialan.

857
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,770
I've heard him talk about you a lot.

858
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,700
I also watched your live coverage.

859
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,690
I was wondering

860
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,340
how such a thin girl

861
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,820
could have so much energy.

862
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,220
I think you're cool.

863
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,200
Do you really think so?

864
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,520
Of course.

865
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,060
I know it's hard for girls to be journalists.

866
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,170
It's not easy.

867
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,530
I really admire you.

868
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,860
Thank you.

869
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,890
It's okay.

870
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,620

You girls are amazing.

872

You've just met,

873
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,440
but it's like you've known each other for years.

874
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,700
None of your business.

875
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,460
Jirong.

876
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,230
Tell me if Shenghao makes you unhappy.

877
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,230
I'll protect you.

878
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,920
I am good at arguing and fighting.

879
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,360
Okay.

880
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,390
Then you'll be my family from now on.

881
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:09,870
Fine.

882
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,910
You are a family.

883
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,950
I'm an outsider.

884
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,890
I'll leave then.

885
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,980
Don't go.

886
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,920
Who will pay if you leave?

887
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,100
Look.

888
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,510

889
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
Then I'll continue to shine.

890
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,540
By the way, Jirong,

891
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,920
I have a small request.

892
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,230
My best friend is your big fan.

893
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,260
Could you please give me an autographed photo of you?

894
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:33,990
No problem.

895
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,520
I will let Sheng Hao give it to you later.

896
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,120

899
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,090
Yeah.

900
