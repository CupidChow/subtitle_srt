Look at them.

00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,360
Did they quarrel?

112
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,420
I heard that the woman

Why didn't I hear it?

Will they fight or not?

116
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,950
Let's wait and see

117
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,500
what's going on there.

118
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,070
Thank goodness.

You'll disappear in five minutes.

121

Looks like they're not going to fight for real.

122
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,060
Let's go.

123
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,030
Forget it.

Did Jiang Shenghao threaten you?

170
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,970
Or is it because you still love him?

In this marriage,

173
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,010

who are you talking to?

180
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,420
I have to go.

Why are we here if she's not home?

191
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,340
Wait for Wu Anwen.

192
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400

193
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,040
Right.

194
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,940
There is only one beloved woman

195
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,690
in my life.

196
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,730
That is my wife, Wu Jirong.

197
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,670
Brother.

198
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,090
Since

199
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,050
Wu Jirong has publicly clarified

200
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,050
the perjury case,

201
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,380
and Wu Anwen has terminated the contract with us,

202
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,840
we're doing this for what?

203
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,510
Why do we have to do it for something?

204
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,750
What is meaningful?

205
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,410
Is it meaningful to seek justice for your friend?

206
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,210
Wu Anwen's car. Let's go.

207
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,390
Mr. Wu.

208
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,510
Hello.

209
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,900
I wonder

210
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,970
is this the floor plan

211
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,470
of the rooms?

212
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,670
No.

213
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,700
I want to know

214
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,360
what's the difference

215
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,760
between Room 1 and Room 2?

216
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,960
Look at this.

217
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,390
This faces south and the other faces north.

218
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,390
Jirong, come on!

219
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,020
Jirong!

220
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,780
Fighting!

221
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,610
Jirong.

222
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,550
Why are you here?

223
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,510
Why are you here?

224
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,700
Do you remember that day?

225
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,830
I wrapped that day.

226
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,150
You and brother picked me up.

227
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,710
Of course I remember.

228
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,430
It's your first movie.

229
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,080
And you won the Best New Artist Award

230
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,510
with this role.

231
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,420
And then...

232
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,070
Tell me.

233
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,690
If I stop acting,

234
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,730
will the audience forget me?

235
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:22,930
Jirong.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
Don't worry.

237
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,630
When you recover,

238
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,770
you can make a comeback anytime.

239
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,220
There are so many new characters

240
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,190
waiting for you.

241
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,600
But I can't act

242
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,760
the role of a wife perfectly.

243
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,840
Jirong, can you tell me

244
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,900
why you want to withdraw the lawsuit?

245
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,090
Please stop asking.

246
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,930
Zhengyu. Zhengyu.

247
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm sorry to Shenghao.

249
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,130
I let my fans down.

250
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,010
It's all my fault.

251
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,800
It's all my fault.

252
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,530
It's all my fault.

253
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,370
What happened? Calm down.

254
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,100
Tell me

255
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,260
what happened.

256
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,740
I can help you solve it.

257
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,660
Trust me, okay?

258
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,440
Stop asking. I can't say it.

259
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,730
-Calm down. -Zhengyu.

260
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,260
Don't push her.

261
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,470
It's fine.

262
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,980
Don't cry, Jirong.

263
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,890
I'm here.

264
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,130
Anwen.

265
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,560
What happened to Jirong?

266
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,800
Why is she here?

267
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,840
She suffers from the major depressive disorder.

268
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,770
What? Major depressive disorder?

269
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,110
I didn't dare to let you see her

270
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,570
because I didn't want her

271
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,580
to experience any stimulation.

272
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,310
No way.

273
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,640
Jirong is so optimistic and tough.

274
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,250
How could she be so depressed?

275
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,000
As you know,

276
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,050
she has always wanted

277
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,600
a happy family.

278
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,840
How much did she sacrifice

279
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,480
to marry Jiang Shenghao?

280
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,570
But what did Jiang Shenghao do?

281
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,220
He hurt her again and again.

282
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,210
Did you read Jiang Shenghao's Weibo today?

283
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,960
He disowned all his ex-girlfriends.

284
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,570
Jirong's heart became a mess again.

285
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,380
He knows that Jirong is soft-hearted.

286
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,980
That's why he's so reckless.

287
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,170
Anwen.

288
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,980
What can I do to help?

289
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,450
If possible,

290
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
I hope she never got married.

291
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,930
Can you turn back time?

292
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,300
Hello, Director.

293
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,910
Please tell us the loss

294
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,329
casued by the landslide.

295
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,670
What is the main cause?

296
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,610
What is it?

297
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,690
Please tell us.

298
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,810
Excuse me.

299
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,100
Where is the settlement for the landslide victims?

300
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,050
Quiet! Quiet!

301
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,290
Calm down.

302
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,330
One by one.

303
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,260
One by one.

304
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,500
I will answer

305
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,290
-all of your questions. -It's quite serious.

306
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,090
Jialan,

307
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,990
find a victim

308
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,230
to know the situation.

309
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,770
I'll take some video and photos.

310
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,250
Liu.

311
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,390
I want to check the scene first.

312
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,360
What are you going to see at the scene?

313
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,170
I did some research on the way.

314
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,780
Nanshan isn't a mountain where mudslides happen easily.

315
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,640
So there must be something wrong.

316
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,980
People are most concerned about

317
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,210
the impact caused by the disaster

318
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,350
and the demands of the landslide victims.

319
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,520
Why do you want to go there

320
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,850
instead of interviewing the landslide victims?

321
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,470
If we only do what we need to do

322
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,330
and play safe,

323
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,540
it's never possible

324
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,160
to dig up some valuable news.

325
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,870
Chen Jialan.

326
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,810
I have been working since 2012.

327
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,510
I don't need you to teach me what news value is.

328
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:19,860
Liu,

329
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,620
I know you're doing this for my own good.

330
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,460
You're afraid I may be tired.

331
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,680
No, no, no.

332
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,610
Where do you want to go?

333
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,030
Just go.

334
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,980
Thank you!

335
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,400
Liu, there's a way.

336
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,510
Let's go.

337
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,870
Okay.

338
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,290
Judging from the scene,

339
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,060
the soil and rocks on the mountain

340
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,380
flowed down because of the rain

341
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,010
and caused the disaster.

342
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,030
But according to the clues we have,

343
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,860
this land was originally a plough in Nanshan.

344
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,120
The mountain is flat.

345
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,450
How did the slope

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,540
suddenly appear?

347
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,180
The location that is not far up from me

348
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
is the top of the landslide.

349
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,440
Let's check the details later.

350
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:08,800
Liu.

351
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,610
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,880
We have to climb up.

353
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,020
Just go.

354
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,700
Thank you.

355
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,580
Be careful.

356
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,610
We can clearly see

357
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,010
the sign of excavation.

358
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,860
The excavation formed a slope down the mountain.

359
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,560
So we may conclude that

360
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,260
some anthropogenic factors

361
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,060
are involved in this disaster.

362
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,300
There's a local there.

363
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,830
Let's go and interview him.

364
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,530
Hello.

365
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,920
Are you okay?

366
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,900
I'm fine.

367
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,150
I'm Chen Jialan from iNEWS.

368
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,930
Can I ask you a few questions?

369
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,330
Sure.

370
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,630
Thank you.

371
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,460
Is the original plough

372
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,920
used for other purposes?

373
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,150
Last year, they said they intend to develop ecotourism here

374
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,710
and requisitioned part of it

375
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,310
to plant ornamental plants.

376
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,650
To help the tourism development,

377
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,510
the village committee rebuilt a mountain climbing track

378
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,970
at where you're standing.

379
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,480
In order to plant ornamental plants,

380
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,160
did they build a canal

381
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,120
for irrigation?

382
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,680
On both sides of the slide road

383
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,780
stand the canals for

384
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,360
large-scale irrigation.

385
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,420
That's right.

386
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,620
I've checked the landscape of Nanshan.

387
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,750
Logically, even if it rains every day,

388
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,510
there will not be landslides.

389
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,660
So that's the reason.

390
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,380
It was caused by the tourism development.

391
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,240
So this is not a natural disaster,

392
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,810
but a man-made disaster.

393
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,550
Sir,

394
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,020
you know a lot about the situation here.

395
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,920
And you're so professional.

396
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,940
Are you a village officer

397
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,460
or an architect?

398
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm Mu Shiming.

399
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,780
Mr. Mu.

400
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm so clumsy.

401
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,680
I've been shooting for a long time, but I didn't notice you.

402
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,030
Perfect disguise.

403
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,480
You are sensitive to news.

404
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,100
But your performance today is very unprofessional.

405
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,560
First,

406
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,860
in front of an interviewee

407
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,550
whom you think is local,

408
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,040
you said your judgement thoughtlessly.

409
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,780
Secondly,

410
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,510
for today's interview,

411
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,180
if you meet an ordinary local,

412
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,540
you can't get anything.

413
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,750
What if you meet the person in charge?

414
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,960
He will say he doesn't know anything,

415
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,780
go back, and tell everyone to shut up.

416
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,910
Then we won't be able to know the truth.

417
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,620
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,680
Don't make such mistakes again.

419
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,330
I won't do it again.

420
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,330
I've checked the situation up there.

421
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,860
Are your materials enough?

422
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,810
Yes, no problem.

423
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,390
Let's go.

424
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,660
Let me do it.

425
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,420
It's okay.

426
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,510
Are you new?

427
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,080
Yes.

428
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,740
I'm an intern reporter.

429
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,000
My name is Chen Jialan.

430
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,460
Chen Jialan?

431
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,060
The editor of iNEWS.

432
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,040
You know me?

433
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,740
Your press releases are good.

434
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,270
Wen Yiru often praises you.

435
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,790
Why did you change your job?

436
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,560
Mr. Mu.

437
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,220
She became an reporter because of you.

438
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,280
No, no.

439
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,730
Well. Yes, actually.

440
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Mr. Mu,

441
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,370
you've always been my idol.

442
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,420
And being a reporter

443
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,780
is my dream.

444
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,230
So I'll learn from you from now on.

445
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,880
Reporters are hard. Keep it up.

Hello.

510
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,800
Don't sit on my sofa.

511
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,910
Stay away.

512
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,650
It's so clean.

513
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,480
I thought you moved out.

514
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,540
I was too busy at work a few days ago.

515
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm a tidy person.

516
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:30,810
By the way,

517
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
I made you a cake.

518
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,450
Come here.

519
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,670
I have some good wine.

520
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,630
It's from a client.

521
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,290
Wine and cake, perfect match.

522
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,550
To you.

523
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,980
Fate brought us together.

524
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,340
We only have 40 minutes.

525
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,000
It'll be over soon.

526
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,640
Yes.

527
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,900
As long as you don't hurt me again,

528
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,330
I'm grateful.

529
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,510
I still want to hit him.

530
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,120
What should I do?

531
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,870
Don't hit me.

532
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,870
I'll pretend to agree to whatever you say next.

533
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,380
Mr. He.

534
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,700
OK.

535
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,550
What?

536
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,080
I mean

537
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,460
the cake is delicious.

538
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,410
Our encounter

539
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,720
is quite special.

540
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,780
I think

541
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,580
we should make some living rules

542
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,380
to avoid

543
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,020
unnecessary misunderstandings and accidents.

544
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,730
Of course.

545
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,740
You are right.

546
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,940
What living rules?

547
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,030
First,

548
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,060
from 10:06 p.m.

549
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,610
to 10:52 p.m. every night,

550
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,820
don't go to bed

551
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
and the bathroom.

552
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,900
I'm cool with not going to bed.

553
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,720
Why I can't go to the bathroom?

554
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,000
Because...

555
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,860
You...

556
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,820
Stop. Stop there.

557
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,020
Okay.

558
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,130
I agree.

559
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,010
Second, during the overlap,

560
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,650
don't touch each other's belongings,

561
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,120
especially those that are quite private.

562
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,920
That's right.

563
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,990
I care about privacy very much.

564
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,800
I agree.

565
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:58,970
Third,

566
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
we shouldn't contact too much.

567
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,760
Things like this

568
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,760
should be the first and last time.

569
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,190
We should avoid contacts

570
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,700
and live our own lives.

571
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,880
Live our own lives.

572
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,580
I'm done.

573
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,290
I'll go back to my room.

574
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:14,730
Wait.

575
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,260
Can I propose one?

576
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,210
Go ahead.

577
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,960
Fourth, no violence.

578
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,940
I explained that.

579
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,320
I didn't know at first.

580
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,780
Even if you didn't,

581
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,940
you can't just come up and hit or scold me.

582
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,740
A girl

583
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,070
saw a strange man in her home.

584
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,400
Should I buy him a drink?

585
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,860
Stop teaching me.

586
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,100
He Zhengyu.

587
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,600
Do you think I haven't investigated you?

588
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,730
As a barrister, you only take big cases

589
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,110
and serve the rich.

590
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,370
You mean

591
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,390
beating me is upholding justice?

592
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,820
At least it's to help the people.

593
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,420
Nonsense!

594
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,690
I also help ordinary people for their lawsuits.

595
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,640
It's just that people

596
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,890
don't care about small cases.

597
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,690
The netizens misunderstood me.

598
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,910
What happened to a righteous lawyer

599
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,730
like you

600
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,090
that made him move to

601
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,580
ordinary people's house?

602
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,900
You don't believe me?

603
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,940
I once helped

604
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,430
an 80-year-old lonely old man

605
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,940
won an insurance fraud case.

606
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,990
He wrote me a letter of gratitude with brush.

607
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,650
That's the only letter I keep.

608
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,370
I've been keeping it on top of the closet.

609
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,630
I'll show it to you now.

610
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,680
Closet?

611
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,900
No, no.

612
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,940
I trust you. I trust you very much.

613
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,120
He Zhengyu.

614
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,130
Are you all right?

615
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,940
Well.

616
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,810
Nothing.

617
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,790
I'm fine.

618
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,240
I told you not to touch my stuff.

619
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,680
But you insisted.

620
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,540
Is this a dump

621
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,970
or a bedroom?

622
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,550
Is this a room for human?

623
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,140
I just put these things

624
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,660
here for now.

625
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,430
I'll pack up when I have time.

626
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,310
Like, right now.

627
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,930
Right?

628
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,940
Don't move!

629
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,610
Why are you so excited?

630
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,800
It's just a shirt.

631
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,480
I'll buy you a new one if it's dirty.

632
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,820
It is a new one.

633
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,050
It's not that dirty.

634
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,450
Let me wash it for you.

635
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,860
What have I done in my life

636
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,830
that made me meet you?

637
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,080
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,290
Fate brought us together.

639
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,650
You said it yourself.

640
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,340
Let's find the letter of gratitude.

641
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,840
Come on.

642
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,670
Did you say...

643
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,710
Stop.

644
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,160
For what?

645
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,880
I don't want to stay here for a second.

646
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm moving out tomorrow.

647
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,340
This is the last time I meet you.

648
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,240
Goodbye forever, Ms. Chen Jialan.

649
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,760
Do you think I want to see you?

650
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,490
I didn't cause the time-space overlap.

651
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,350
I wish you could disappear now.

652
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,090
Brother.

653
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,610
I want to move out.

654
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,660
Right now.

655
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,630
This minute.

656
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,370
I made the cake myself.

657
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,320
Although it's not very pretty,

658
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,020
but it tastes good.

659
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,990
Try it.

660
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,540
Here, Liu.

661
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,210
Jialan.

662
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,420
You've become a reporter.

663
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,080
A small cake is not enough.

664
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,090
You should buy us a big meal.

665
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,300
Sure.

666
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,190
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

667
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,990
No.

668
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,390
Let's do it today.

669
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,400
How about today?

670
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,220
Sure.

671
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm free tonight.

672
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,020
We haven't had fun for a long time.

673
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,900
I'm fine too.

674
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,480
Let's get together this time.

675
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,970
Yes.

676
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:18,820
OK.

677
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,580
Okay. I'll book the restaurant.

678
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,010
Cool.

679
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,790
I just got the news.

680
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,730
Someone is making trouble in front of Fei's Company.

681
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,940
Last month, their boss demolished others' houses and beat someone up.

682
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,340
Who knows what happened?

683
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,750
Editor-in-chief, I know.

684
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:37,840
Tell me.

685
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,100
There is a commercial demolition carrying on in the north.

686
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,030
One of the relocation households is called Li Ziqiang.

687
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,490
He's not satisfied with the demolition conditions

688
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,810
so he refused the demolition.

689
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,940
The 13th of last month,

690
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,950
the chairman of Fei's Company, Fei Meng,

691
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,080
went to persuade Li Ziqiang in person.

692
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,260
But according to Li Ziqiang,

693
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,080
Fei Meng didn't discuss

694
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,010
about house compensation and settlement

695
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,550
but threatened him

696
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,940
and even assaulted him.

697
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,590
That's why Li Ziqiang sued Fei Meng to court.

698
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,380
Not bad.

699
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,520
Follow this news.

700
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,340
Thank you, editor-in-chief.

701
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,960
The well-known forced demolition and assult case

702
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,950
of Fei's Company

703
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,820
will be heard in court in a few days.

704
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,220
However, before the trial,

705
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,260
people involved in this case

706
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,860
suddenly gathered in front the company.

707
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,480
Reporter Chen Jialan from the iNEWS

708
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,410
will bring you a follow-up report.

709
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,170
We are now downstairs of Fei's Company.

710
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,380
Come out and apologize!

711
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,850
As for the details,

712
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,330
we'll report in real time.

713
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,680
The materials are almost done.

714
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,280
Let's go.

715
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,660
Liu.

716
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,500
That man over there

717
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,130
is Li Ziqiang's brother, Li Zili.

718
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,520
Let's go to interview him.

719
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,400
Chen Jialan.

720
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,170
It's the most tiring to go out with you.

721
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,010
Do you know that?

722
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:55,610
Liu.

723
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,670
Just a few words.

724
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,130
Let's go.

725
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,000
Come out and apologize!

726
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,700
Come out and apologize!

727
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,030
Come out and apologize!

728
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,870
Coming.

729
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,790
You're quick.

730
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,050
Have you packed up?

731
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:13,820
Of course.

732
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,290
Brother,

733
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,699
you've seen that photo 800 times.

734
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,159
What's there to see?

735
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,370
What's special?

736
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,350
I can't miss any clue.

737
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,210
It's not that simple.

738
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,340
Well,

739
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,420
since Jiang Shenghao is not a playboy,

740
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,590
why does Wu Jirong endure him?

741
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,880
Is she controlled by emotions?

742
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,969
I don't know anything now.

743
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:40,570
By the way,

744
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,260
I asked you to investigate Chen Kexin.

745
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,909
Any news?

746
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:44,969
Not yet.

747
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,560
But I've made a deal with them.

748
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,440
If anything,

749
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,040
let me know immediately.

750
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,660
She's not bad.

751
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,910
Chen Jialan?

752
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,330
Who?

753
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,820
Chen Jia...

754
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,620
That female ghost?

755
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:12,940
No.

756
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,710
That female reporter.

757
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,060
She's also Jiang Shenghao's ex-girlfriend.

758
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,620
Miss the time with Rat.

759
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,310
Long time no see.

760
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,350
Let's take a group photo.

761
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,030
Not really.

762
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,630
More like friends grew up together.

763
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,110
Friends grew up together.

764
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,050
Today, I met Rat's fiancee.

765
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,930
She will be the happiest bride

766
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,980
in the world.

767
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,270
Jiang Shenghao's fiancee?

768
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,020
That should be Jirong.

769
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,340
When?

770
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
September 24th, 2021.

771
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,540
Jiang Shenghao proposed successfully

772
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,700
and took Jirong to see Chen Jialan.

773
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,920
What a coincidence!

774
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,880
If possible,

775
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,330
I hope she never got married.

776
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,170
Can you turn back time?

777
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,060
Maybe...

778
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,390
Maybe I can use this coincidence.

779
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,620
What?

780
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,380
Let's move the boxes.

781
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:29,940
No.

782
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,300
No?

783
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,150
We can't just

784
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,600
and do whatever we want.

785
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,450
You should have told me in advance.

786
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,130
Come on. Cheers.

787
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,700
Come on. Cheers.

788
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,760
Congratulations.

789
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,250
Just help yourselves,

790
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,390
especially Liu.

791
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,650
You taught me many things and made great contributions.

792
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,310
Just enjoy.

793
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,700
Come on. I feel embarrassed.

794
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,740
Let's eat.

795
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,360
Let's eat.

796
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Hi, anything?

797
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,030
Chen Jialan.

798
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,560
Did you see my location?

799
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,220
Come here.

800
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,070
What's so urgent?

801
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,290
Top urgency.

802
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,060
I need emergency backup.

803
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,870
What did you do?

804
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,870
How about tomorrow?

805
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,890
Really, I'm serious.

806
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,960
Once you miss,

807
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,480
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

808
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,310
Okay, wait for me.

809
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,430
Sorry, everyone.

810
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,900
Something happened.

811
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,050
I have to leave first.

812
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,340
Enjoy your meal.

813
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,800
I've paid the bill.

814
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,310
I'm sorry.

815
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,070
I'm leaving.

816
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,950
What an interesting guy.

817
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,300
She bought us a meal and left.

818
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,300
She's only been a reporter for a few days.

819
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,720
We're seniors after all.

820
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,980
Does she have any respect for seniors like us?

821
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,700
Enough.

822
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,230
Even food can't shut you up.

823
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,940
Everyone has an emergency.

824
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,540
Jialan paid the bill for nothing.

825
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,210
Come on.

826
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,830
Leaver her behind.

827
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,840
Come on. Cheers.

828
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,800
Cheers. Cheers.

829
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,570
Cheers!

830
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,090
Jiang Shenghao.

831
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,060
Jialan.

832
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,460
Are you serious?

833
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
What do you think?

834
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,130
This is where I first met Jirong.

835
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,120
It's perfect to propose here.

836
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,370
Every dog has his day.

837
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,000
I really cherish the time with Jirong.

838
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,350
I'm very grateful.

839
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,890
So I want to give her all the best.

840
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,360
Gosh.

841
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,980
I know you're in love.

842
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,520
You don't have to become a poet.

843
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,850
Just be an ordinary man.

844
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,790
Yes, I forgot.

845
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,230
You are still single.

846
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,520
Get lost!

847
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,000
Look at the photo wall.

848
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I carefully prepared it.

849
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,760
The photos witnessed all our love experiences.

850
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,420
Take a look.

851
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,370
So many photos.

852
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,050
This is the first time I went to the recording for a new film with her.

853
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,820
This is the last time we went skiing.

854
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,820
We went to the beach to watch sunset.

855
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,870
What do you think?

856
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,360
Well.

857
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,630
You're getting engaged.

858
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,100
Why don't you bring her to see me?

859
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,030
She's a public figure. She's busy.

860
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,600
When it's settled, I will.

861
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,540
I'm also busy.

862
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,980
I know you are the busiest.

863
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,310
But you're the kindest.

864
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,670
We are like brothers.

865
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,600
No one can help me if you refuse.

866
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,700
Help me check what's missing.

867
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,840
Give me some advice.

868
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,420
Fine, I'll help you

869
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,430
Let me show you how good I am.

870
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:33,880
Cool.

871
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,600
First,

872
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,990
get along with Chen Jialan.

873
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,170
Second,

874
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,200
ask her to make an appointment with Jirong living in four months ago.

875
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,860
Then everything will be fine.

876
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,530
Meat is the best food in the world.

877
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
