The case of Fei's Company's forced demolition by attacking

14
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,210
has been revealed.

15
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,420
When Li Zili was in charge of the project,

16
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,280
he was fired for cutting corners.

17
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,510
So he held a grudge.

65
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,280
To put it nicely, we are uncrowned winners,

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,940
but actually we are just soldiers

As journalists,

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,339
we shouldn't focus on our subjective feelings too much.

75
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,890
It may affect our judgment.

76
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,590
I think I've heard that before.

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,770

Mr. Mu,

80
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,030
may I ask you a question?

81
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,150
It's not about work. Please don't mind it.

82
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,360
Go ahead.

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,850
You and He Zhengyu

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,680
have known each other for years.

85
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,060
Every time you meet,

86
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,320
there is all the tension around.

87
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
Why is that?

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,010
Nothing.

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,360
We're not on the same boat.

90
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,830
By the way,

91
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,850
are you close to him?

92
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,180
No.

93
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,450
But when you were talking,

94
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,820
your eyes turned left unconsciously.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
It means you have a history with him.

96
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,870
Then you pressed your lips subconsciously.

97
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,730
It means that the history makes you uncomfortable.

98
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,860
Of course,

99
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,150
This is just my guess.

100
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,020
We do know each other.

101
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,340
I just think he is not a nice person.

102
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,400
There is something

103
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,770
between us.

104
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,450
As a professor of law,

105
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,540
my father thought that I should be a lawyer

106
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,740
after my graduation.

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,150
But I'm not talented

108
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,800
nor interested.

109
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,260
He Zhengyu is different.

110
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,420
He always wants to be a top lawyer

111
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,730
and he is talented.

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,580
So in my father's eyes,

113
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,330
He Zhengyu seems to be his son.

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm just

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,210
an unfilial son.

116
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,400
Mr. Mu.

117
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,860
This is wine.

118
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,180
I didn't notice.

119
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,200
Mr. Mu.

120
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,850
This...

121
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,850
Hey, what's going on?

122
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,740
You got him drunk so quickly.

123
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,980
I didn't.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,220
He drank it himself.

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,940
Take him home.

126
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,270
I don't know where he lives.

127
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,000
Then take him to your place.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,040
My place?

129
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,000
Is that okay?

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,240
Then what about my place?

131
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,900
Be careful.

132
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,860

134
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,140
This is my apartment.

135
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,260
You were drunk.

136
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,720
I have no place to send you, so I took you here.

137
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,440
Sorry.

138
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,670

140
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,310

146

147
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,020
I haven't written

Yes.

152
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,179
That's great.

Let me send you to the door.

154
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,830

155
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,960
You can't stand up.

156

Let me help you up.

158
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,220
I know.

159
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,850
Your bag is on this chair.

160
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,420
Jialan.

161
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,990
I'm not in such a hurry.

162
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,850
Mr. Mu, it's already ten o'clock.

163
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,010
The taxi fee is getting higher.

164
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,560
Take care of yourself.

165
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,620
Okay, you too.

166
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,090
Okay.

167
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,140
Bye, Mr. Mu.

168
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,640
Bye.

169
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,800
That was close.

170
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,500
Mr. Mu, what's wrong?

171
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,230
I forgot my phone.

172
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,900
Your phone?

173
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,690
Where is it?

174
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,130
It should be on the sofa.

175
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,250
The sofa?

176
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,660
Why is he here?

177
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,680
Jialan.

178
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,160
When did you prepare these?

179
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,860
When you were asleep.

180
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,950
Do you have a date later?

181
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,010
No.

182
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,230
How is that possible?

183
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,060
I mean, it's late.

184
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,860
You didn't have dinner.

185
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,090
I'm afraid you'll be hungry after drinking.

186
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,220
I'm a little hungry.

187
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,440
I'll have some.

188
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,280
Thank you.

Jialan.

190
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,410
I didn't expect you to be so good at cooking.

191
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,260
Good at cooking?

192
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,180
She is good at enticing.

193
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,330
It's nothing.

194
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
Just some simple dishes.

195
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,340
Make them for me.

196
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,810
Eat.

197
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,010
Okay.

198
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,180
Jialan, thank you.

199
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,900
You didn't have to push me out

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,360
to prepare these just now.

201
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,700
Surprise?

202
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,450
How did you know I would come back?

203
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,050
You...

204
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,470
What's wrong, Jialan?

205
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,240
I...

206
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,150
Mr. Mu, I...

207
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,510
Jialan.

208
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,860
What's wrong?

209
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,500
Mr. Mu.

210
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,840
I found your phone.

211
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,020
Thank you.

212
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:49,940
Jialan.

213
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,550
You look like a kid after drinking.

214
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,460
A little crazy?

215
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,490
You are cute.

216
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,140
Did you hear the flushing?

217
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,620
Mr. Mu.

218
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
The apartment I rent is very shabby.

219
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,300
The soundproofing is very poor.

220
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,140
You can hear the flushing from upstairs.

221
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
The old lady downstairs

222
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,540
came to me several times.

223
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,180
How dare she challenge me by knocking the wall?

224
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,110
I'll knock back.

225
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,840
Mr. Mu.

226
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,320
Enjoy your meal.

227
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,260
Wait for me.

228
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,910
Can you stop making trouble?

229
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,090
What if Mr. Mu finds you?

230
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,130
-So what? -Keep your voice down.

231
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,450
I'm not an illegal immigrant

232
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,710
and I'm not a fugitive.

233
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,850
So what he finds out?

234
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,050
What if the time-space overlap is exposed?

235
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,420
No one will know it if we keep our mouths shut.

236
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,080
Given his current condition,

237
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,380
he wouldn't know.

238
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,220
But...

239
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,250
But...

240
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,810
You're afraid that Mu Shiming would misunderstand that

241
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,540
we're living together, right?

242
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,450
Yes.

243
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,100
No.

244
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,470
We're just roommates.

245
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,730
I don't want to get involved.

246
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,330
You like Mu Shiming.

247
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,390
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,230
I only see Mr. Mu as my teacher.

249
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,430
If that's the case,

250
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,320
you brought your drunk teacher

251
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,260
in the middle of the night?

252
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,790
You're petty.

253
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,020
From now on,

254
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,350
you stay here.

255
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,740
If you make any sound,

256
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,030
don't blame me for being rude.

257
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:56,970
Alright.

258
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,510
All done. She won't make any more trouble.

259
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,490
You look cute when you're angry.

260
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,280
Really?

261
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,820
I've been practicing martial arts since I was a kid.

262
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,340
So I have a bad temper.

263
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,460
I think girls should be like you.

264
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,790
That's more vigorous.

265
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,130
I don't like

266
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
girls who are delicate.

267
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,580
But being too vigorous makes me

268
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,280
sleepy at night.

269
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,860
I'll leave.

270
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,860
I'll get a Uber.

271
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,440
Okay.

272
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,060
The battery is dead.

273
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
I have a power bank.

274
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,110
Let me get it for you.

275
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Are you okay?

276
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,180
I'm fine.

277
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,060
Let me take a look.

278
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,820
I'm fine.

279
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,380
The circuit tripped.

280
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,480
The circuit is aging.

281
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,770
It's always like this.

282
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Let me take a look.

283
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,290
Let me help you.

284
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,050
No.

285
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,700
I can do it by myself.

286
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,970
Mr. Mu, wait a moment.

287
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,990
I'll go check it.

288
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,090
He Zhengyu.

289
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,940
What do you want?

290
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm sleepy.

291
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,500
I turned off the light and I'm going to sleep.

292
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,210
You can turn off the lights in your room.

293
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,140
Why did you turn off all the lights?

294
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,580
I don't want to see

295
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,220
people flirting in my house.

296
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,940
Flirting?

297
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,880
Tell me.

298
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,790
What do you want?

299
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,490
Promise me one thing.

300
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,210
What is it?

301
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,660
Ask Jirong from your world

302
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,620
to my house.

303
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,660
Since she's your friend,

304
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,420
can't you ask her over in your world?

305
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,380
No.

306
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,510
That's why I'm asking you for help.

307
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,860
No?

308
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,340
I'll go out if you won't help.

309
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,070
How dare you!

310
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,240
Help me ask Jirong over.

311
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,580
Impossible.

312
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,350
Jialan, how is it?

313
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,160
Do you need my help?

314
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,540
I'm fine, Mr. Mu.

315
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,560
It's fixed.

316
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,130
Look.

317
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,800
Charge your phone first.

318
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,930
I'll be right there.

319
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
You don't want to help me?

320
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,280
I'll help you.

321
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,380
If she is really your friend,

322
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,060
you should know

323
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,390
Wu Jirong and Jiang Shenghao are engaged.

324
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,460
I know they are engaged,

325
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,660
so I asked you to ask Jirong over.

326
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,630
What?

327
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,700
You feel worried?

328
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,930
Are you going to make a move on Jirong?

329
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,900
Make a move?

330
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,860
If I wanted to,

331
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,850
I would have pursued her long ago.

332
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,980
Why bother to make a move now?

333
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,060
Because she's engaged,

334
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,300
you know you have no chance.

335
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,580
That's why you do it.

336
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,660
Chen Jialan.

337
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,980
You shouldn't be a journalist.

338
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,640
You should be a writer.

339
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,590
Even if I ask her to come,

340
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,830
what if she finds out the overlap?

341
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,270
How do you explain it?

342
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,790
It's simple.

343
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,099
The time-space overlap will start after Jirong comes.

344
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,790
Then I come as a guest

345
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,170
and meet Jirong by chance.

346
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,710
What about after the overlap?

347
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,920
She will find it anyway.

348
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,250
Send her away

349
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,020
ten seconds before

350
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,720
the time-space overlap ends.

351
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,780
She won't find out.

352
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,240
That's a good plan.

353
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,810
I won't help you.

354
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,780
You agree?

355
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,420
Yes.

356
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,910
I'm warning you.

357
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,460
Don't make any sound.

358
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,020
Mr. Mu.

359
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,820
I'm sorry.

360
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,990
I'm so sorry.

361
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,760
It's okay.

362
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,850
Jialan.

363
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,040
I think you feel unease

364
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,660
having someone at your home.

365
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,310
Yes.

366
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,860
I'm used to live alone.

367
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,300
My phone lost

368
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,050
service here.

369
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,510
I'll order a taxi outside.

370
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,460
The signal here is poor.

371
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,790
There will be signal outside.

372
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,420
Here.

373
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,610
Jialan, thank you for today.

374
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
You're welcome. We're colleagues.

375
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,180
We'll be drinking buddies.

376
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,050
Okay.

377
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,430
Welcome to drink here often, Mr. Mu.

378
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,610
Really?

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,360
Okay.

380
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,500
Bye, Mr. Mu.

381
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,390
Bye.

382
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,930
Welcome to drink here often, Mr. Mu.

383
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,960
He Zhengyu.

384
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,400
What's wrong with you?

385
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,010
What a waste.

386
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,420
Are you journalists

387
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,530
very poor?

388
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,300
You can't appreciate this top-class steak?

389
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,350
I won't ask Jirong over for you.

390
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,820
Don't even think about it.

391
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,360
You must keep your word.

392
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,780
You just promised me.

393
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,930
And now you broke your promise.

394
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,940
I'm a person of integrity.

395
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,130
But when I was threatened,

396
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,320
it didn't count.

397
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,530
Please.

398
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,650
I made all these dishes

399
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,060
for you.

400
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,700
That's why you did it.

401
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,860
You are really

402
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,980
prepared.

403
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,060
Let me tell you.

404
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,010
No way.

405
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,350
The first move,

406
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,970
give her what she likes.

407
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,680
What does she like?

408
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,630
She likes to eat all kinds of junk food.

409
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,480
Buy them.

410
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,530
Buy as many as you can.

411
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,830
It's okay. Here's the second move.

412
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,850
Humor.

413
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,800
Girls like humorous men.

414
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,470
The first move didn't work.

415
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,750
Try the second move.

416
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,790
Chen Jialan,

417
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,140
let me tell you a joke.

418
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,230
What do you call someone

419
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,420
with no body and no nose?

420
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,500
Do you know it?

421
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,430
The answer is

422
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,850
"nobody knows".

423
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,380
Because

424
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,330
he has no body and no nose.

425
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,090
No.

426
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,540
You're not me.

427
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,660
How can you do this?

428
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,020
What are you good at?

429
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,430
What do you think?

430
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,130
Don't worry.

431
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,320
There's a third move.

432
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,040
The simplest and the most difficult one.

433
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,250
Talk to her.

434
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,970
Open your heart and talk to her.

435
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,430
Tell her

436
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,780
the darkest

437
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,940
secrets

438
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,220
in your heart.

439
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,450
You will get closer

440
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,070
to each other soon.

441
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,540
Let me tell you one more thing.

442
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,000
Something embarrassing.

443
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,110
I'm very afraid of ghosts,

444
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,640
especially female ghosts.

445
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,860
One night, there was a female ghost...

446
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,110
Do you know that's my cup...

447
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,340
[The year of 2022]

448
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,430
Brother.

449
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,670
When are you going to do what you promised me?

450
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,130
It's been a month.

451
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,590
Don't worry.

452
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,870
I promised you

453
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,630
and I will do it.

454
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,420
When you feel better,

455
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,960
I'll do it right away.

456
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,060
Be good.

457
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,690
Take the medicine first.

458
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,350
No.

459
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,570
Fine.

460
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,230
Watch the TV.

461
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,300
Relax.

462
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,070
No.

463
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,780
Fine.

464
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,970
Brother.

465
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,470
Leave me alone for a while.

466
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,460
Please.

467
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,680
Okay.

468
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,330
I'm at the door.

469
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,350
Call me if you need anything.

470
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,360
He won't let you in?

471
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,520
Wu Anwen is too cautious.

472
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,240
You are close to Jirong.

473
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,050
You won't do anything to her.

474
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,090
Maybe he followed the doctor's order.

475
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,150
What else can we do?

476
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,750
I left a note to Jirong

477
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,830
and asked the nurse who took care of her to give it to her.

478
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,430
If this method doesn't work,

479
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,980
we can only find

480
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,510
the Jirong four months ago.

481
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,230
How about the suggestions I gave you last time?

482
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,360
Did they work to deal with Chen Jialan?

483
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,170
How dare you mention it?

484
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,340
What's wrong?

485
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,580
Jialan, you are back.

486
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,170
Chen Jialan.

487
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,380
Have you heard it?

488
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,450
Li Ziqiang and those relocation households

489
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,510
went to the Fei's Company to protest.

490
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,740
Li Ziqiang is going to sue the Fei's Company.

491
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,870
The relocation households in that area want to sue them.

492
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,450
Then I'll go.

493
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,350
Forget it.

494
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,460
Li Ziqiang just lost the lawsuit.

495
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,890
The public opinion on the Internet is supporting the Fei's Company.

496
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,320
He can't make any noises.

497
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,150
That's right.

498
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,120
So many media know about this.

499
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,640
Everyone knows that the news is pointless.

500
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
I'd better go.

501
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,560
Let's go. I'll get the car.

502
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,880
Okay.

503
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,020
What are you doing?

504
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,730
I was wrong last time.

505
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,020
But the law has already punished me.

506
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,970
Mr. Li, you misunderstood.

507
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,510
Mr. Li,

508
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,900
we're here for the demolition.

509
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,110
We just came from Fei's Company.

510
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,810
It's full of protesters there.

511
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,740
Would you like to tell us in detail?

512
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,630
The Fei's Company

513
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,250
wanted to demolish our place long ago.

514
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,070
Those people came to me

515
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,880
and forced me to sign the demolition agreement.

516
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
But the compensation

517
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,490
is not even half of

518
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,780
what we agreed before.

519
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,010
If I don't sign it,

520
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,420
they hit me.

521
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,580
I was injured.

522
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,560
My wife is seriously ill.

523
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
She needs the money for the surgery.

524
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,120
I put all my hope

525
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,430
on the compensation.

526
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,810
Mr. Li,

527
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,780
you said you were injured before.

528
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,500
Yes.

529
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,490
So your brother took the chance to persuade you

530
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,740
to hurt yourself

531
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,810
and extort money?

532
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,640
Didn't you promise not to mention it?

533
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,750
I was wrong

534
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,710
on that matter.

535
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,390
I really regret it now.

536
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,880
Because of me,

537
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,220
everyone thinks

538
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,380
the relocation household is not worthy of sympathy.

539
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
I brought trouble to the neighbors.

540
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,550
Mr. Li,

541
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,940
are you going to stand up

542
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,480
and sue the Fei's Company?

543
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,270
It's too hard to maintain the legal rights.

544
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,040
They said

545
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,830
if we sue them,

546
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,800
they'll hire Mr. He to defend.

547
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,110
Mr. He is amazing.

548
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,250
He has never lost a lawsuit.

549
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,330
We can't win.

550
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,080
Here.

551
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,470
Thank you. I'm not hungry.

552
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,180
I bought it for you. Eat it.

553
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,500
Thank you.

554
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,900
Don't thank me.

555
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,720
Thank the company.

556
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,460
The company will reimburse it.

557
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,250
Jialan, let me tell you.

558
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,550
I've been in the company for almost ten years.

559
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,060
You're the most hardworking journalist

560
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,920
I've ever seen.

561
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,510
I just became a journalist.

562
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,640
I want to learn more.

563
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520
You can learn more.

564
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,780
But remember, as a girl,

565
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,350
when you are in danger,

566
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,630
you must learn to protect yourself.

567
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,960
Alright, get in the car.

568
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,430
My wife is waiting for me at home.

569
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,250
Thank you.

570
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,000
He Zhengyu, come out!

571
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,820
Did you drink?

572
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,330
Come here.

573
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,360
Don't come over.

574
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,270
We can talk. No violence.

575
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,360
Don't pass

576
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,820
negative emotions to others.

577
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,710
You are such a cold-blooded and heartless person.

578
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,640
What do you mean?

579
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,840
Did you take the Fei's demolition case?

580
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,370
Yes.

581
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,120
The agency fee is as much as your salary for years.

582
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Don't be jealous.

583
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,060
Do you only care about money?

584
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,940
I earn it legally.

585
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,660
Don't you work for money?

586
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,110
Do you work for love?

587
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,310
You can talk.

588
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,590
But I know who you really are.

589
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,410
It's too early.

590
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,710
This is who I really am.

591
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,750
Why did you hit me again?

592
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,010
Why can't I hit you?

593
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,380
You are immoral,

594
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,540
greedy and evil.

595
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,580
Chen Jialan, let me tell you.

596
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,660
I could use more words to describe you.

597
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,810
You can't beat me.

598
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,400
You're unpredictable,

599
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,190
arrogant, domineering and violent.

600
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,540
You are nothing but a loser.

601
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,320
You just got a pretty face.

602
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,000
Shut up!

603
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,830
I told you you can't beat me.

604
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,820
Do you know what I saw today?

605
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,740
The relocation households protested at the Fei's Company

606
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,180
under the sun.

607
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,980
Li Ziqiang's wife is seriously ill

608
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,020
and lying in bed.

609
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,170
The Fei's Company even sent people to their houses to harass them.

610
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,460
And you're bullying them with the Fei's Company.

611
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,440
Who said that?

612
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,970
I'm a lawyer.

613
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,700
A lawyer must maintain the legal rights of the client.

614
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,760
This is the basic quality of a lawyer.

615
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,300
Besides, I'm good at it.

616
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,260
He Zhengyu.

617
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,260
Last time,

618
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,410
you were on the side of justice by luck.

619
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,900
But this time, you won't.

620
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,140
Because I'll keep an eye on you.

621
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,540
I'll make you lose badly.

622
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,110
Ms. Chen,

623
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,630
let's make a bet.

624
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,440
What bet?

625
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,160
If I win,

626
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,780
you promise me to ask Jirong over for me.

627
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,660
You never give up.

628
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
What if you lose?

629
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,740
I won't lose.

630
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,200
If you lose,

631
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,610
you need to disappear from this house.

632
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,820
Chen Jialan.

633
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,060
Come out and have a drink.

634
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,200
Not interested.

635
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,480
Let's drink together.

636
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,180
What is it?

637
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,620
The money for breaking your cup last time.

638
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,560
Twenty?

639
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,890
What? Too much?

640
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,610
You need to add a zero after 20.

641
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,660
You evil lawyers

642
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,420
could really waste your money.

643
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,340
Give me the receipt.

644
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,080
Otherwise, how would I know it's worth 200 yuan?

645
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
I bought the cup long time ago.

646
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,540
How can I find the receipt?

647
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,990
How about this? Treat me to noodles.

648
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,630
Then let's call it even.

649
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,060
Dear media friends,

650
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:37,920
[2021.09.26]
[2:06 p.m. Fei's Company]

651
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,580
we have a press conference today

652
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,080
to make an announcement

653
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
to everyone.

654
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,810
[Fei's Company]

655
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,140
As the legal advisor of the Fei's Company,

656
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
through the authorization of the board,

657
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,630
I've conducted self-investigation on the company.

658
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,900
We found the demolition company hired by the Fei's Company

659
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,500
violated major regulations

660
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,390
during the demolition process.

661
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,720
On behalf of the Fei's Company,

662
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,700
I'm formally taking legal actions against the demolition company.

663
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,270
Why are you so happy today?

664
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,990
Am I?

665
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,270
Yes.

666
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,650
The angrier you are, the calmer you are.

667
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,430
When you are happy, you are always relaxed.

668
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,860
I bet with Chen Jialan

669
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,750
and I won.

670
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,350
What bet?

671
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,670
It has something to do with Jirong.

672
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,270
By the way,

673
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,540
how's going

674
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,540
with Jiang Shenghao and Chen Kexin?

675
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,890
Jiang Shenghao

676
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,680
is drinking all day.

677
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,110
And he went to Wu Anwen

678
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,240
to ask to see Jirong.

679
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,410
Poor man.

680
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,980
Anyway, Wu Anwen

681
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,930
is really nice to his sister.

682
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,270
He's very protective.

683
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,540
Jirong's brother has always taken good care of her.

684
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,800
What about Chen Kexin?

685
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,780
Still no news.

686
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,060
He Zhengyu,

687
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,470
your skill point is not enough.

688
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,420
I'm saving it up.

689
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,100
Wait.

690
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,660
Mr. Mu.

691
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,430
What did you get?

692
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,140
Thank you for the demolition case.

693
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,500
I bought some coffee for you.

694
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,540
Mr. Mu, thank you.

695
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,800
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

696
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,400
Jialan, I bought you a glass of juice

697
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,550
to take some vitamin C.

698
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,750
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

699
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,680
Jialan.

700
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,780
Jialan.

701
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,540
What are you doing?

702
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,830
Take some vitamin C.

703
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,710
Thank you.

704
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,670
Keep it for me for several days.

705
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,640
It's mine.

706
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,370
But I didn't expect

707
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,500
the demolition case

708
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,720
is on the trend again.

709
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,140
Everyone didn't expect

710
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,640
He Zhengyu

711
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,460
has indirectly defended the rights for the relocation households.

712
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,530
I even made a bet on this.

713
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,150
And I lost the bet.

714
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,330
Piaopiao,

715
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,220
Let me ask you a question.

716
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,240
I have a male friend.

717
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,590
He asked me to ask my best friend's fiancee

718
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,700
to clear up some misunderstandings.

719
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Do you think I should help him or not?

720
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,520
It sounds complicated.

721
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,780
Let me get it straight.

722
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,570
Your boyfriend.

723
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,180
No.

724
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,040
A male friend.

725
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,710
Your male friend asked you

726
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,340
to ask another male friend's

727
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,470
girlfriend to meet.

728
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,740
It sounds a bit complicated.

729
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,100
But that's it.

730
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,110
Now you're worried that

731
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,400
it will cause trouble?

732
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,740
What misunderstanding?

733
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,210
He didn't say it.

734
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,160
But he said they were just friends.

735
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,670
There is nothing between them.

736
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,960
But I'm still worried.

737
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,690
What kind of person

738
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,310
are your friend?

739
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,410
He's calm, proud and arrogant.

740
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,660
How long has he known

741
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,260
your best friend's fiancée?

742
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,600
More than ten years.

743
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,740
You are thinking too much.

744
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,020
They are just friends.

745
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,270
Why?

746
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,390
Think about it.

747
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,860
A proud and arrogant man

748
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,389
doesn't need you to

749
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,940
help him chasing a girl.

750
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,770
A proud and arrogant man

751
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,639
won't step in

752
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,010
when the girl is getting married.

753
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,940
His pride won't allow it.

754
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,199
You got a point.

755
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,909
Thank you, Piaopiao.

756
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,409
It's 5:30.

757
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,900
Time to off the work.

758
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm leaving.

759
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:35,909
Okay.

760
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,090
Jialan.

761
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,030
I have a date.

762
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:38,780
I'm leaving.

763
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,620
Bye.

764
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,420
Okay, then I'll admit defeat.

765
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,080
He Zhengyu,

766
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,989
I'll grant your wish this time.

767
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,420
Jialan.

768
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,880
I have to leave early today.

769
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,739
Please help me

770
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,940
with this article.

771
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,690
Work harder to improve faster.

772
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,090
Mr. Mu.

773
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,850
What's wrong?

774
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,610
I have a stomachache.

775
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
Let's go to the hospital.

776
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,510
I'm fine.

777
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,010
I just need some medicine.

778
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Where is your medicine? I'll get it for you.

779
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,310
Tell me.

780
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,460
I run out of medicine.

781
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,860
Let me call someone to deliver it.

782
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,510
No.

783
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,470
There's a traffic jam now.

784
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,730
It'll be faster if I go.

785
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,410
How about this?

786
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,110
Send me the name of the medicine.

787
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm going.

788
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,860
It's open.

789
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,450
It's coming.

790
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,150
So close.

791
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,550
It was so close.

792
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,490
I almost made it.

793
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,090
He Zhengyu.

794
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,940
He Zhengyu.

795
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,140
Can you hear me?

Why doesn't she just admit defeat?

And now she is running away?

816
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,440
She doesn't come back so late.

817
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,420
Did something happen to her?

What are you doing?

826

Do you have any common sense?

827
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,520
What if you get electrocuted?

828
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,030
The lamp is too old.

829
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,940
The circuit is a bit loose.

830
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,880
Come and help me.

831
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,780
Leave it.

832
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,910
Ask the handyman

833
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,340
to repair it tomorrow.

834
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,340
I don't want to be alone with you

835
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,650
in this dark house.

836
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,440
Do it.

837
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,090
Chen Jialan.

838
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,620
I just took a shower.

839
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,950
I'm still wet.

840
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,590
What if I get electrocuted?

841
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,210
Don't worry.

842
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,460
Pests will live long.

843
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
You'll be fine.

844
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,480
I'll beat you if you keep nagging.

845
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,450
Stop bossing around.

846
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,150
I haven't asked you yet.

847
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,430
What?

848
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,120
Are you a fish?

849
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,670
You have a terrible memory.

850
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,530
What happened yesterday?

851
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,930
Why didn't you come back?

852
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,480
You can't admit defeat?

853
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,060
It's not like that.

854
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,810
I was delayed yesterday.

855
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
You are avoiding.

856
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,340
You can avoid it forever.

857
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,640
I'm not.

858
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,110
Mr. Mu had a stomachache yesterday.

859
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,650
I can't leave him alone.

860
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,340
Well.

861
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,230
So this is the reason.

862
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,230
No wonder.

863
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,860
Mr. Mu is much more

864
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,450
important than me.

865
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,610
You're acting weird.

866
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,620
I will ask Jirong over.

867
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,100
That's more like it.

868
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,550
Give it to me.

869
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,760
Move.

870
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,230
The screw is loose.

871
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,540
Just tighten it.

872
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,020
Okay, try it.

873
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,690
Done.

874
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,260
There's another loose one.

875
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:28,780
Chen Jialan.

876
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
I... I got electrocuted.

877
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,940
Help me!

878
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,220
Hurry! Help me!

879
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,730
Help me!

880
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,460

Okay.

885
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,910
It's like we are plowing here.

894
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,140
You look good from this angle.

895
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,810

Fine.
