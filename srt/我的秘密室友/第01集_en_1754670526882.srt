she left quietly at 8:13 A.M.,

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,210
which is three minutes

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,940
after you left the apartment.

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,110
I have a testimony

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,920
signed by Ms. Chen Kexin.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,850
It says that

34
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,620
you were together that whole night

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,590
and had sex.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,010
That's impossible.

37
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,770
Impossible.

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,500
I didn't!

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,820

Please calm down and sit down before you talk.

43
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,790
In conclusion,

44
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,370
the evidence we submitted is sufficient to prove that

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,580
the defendant committed marital infidelity.

46
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,480
The relationship between the two parties is completely broken.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,540
Therefore, the plaintiff requests the presiding judge to adjudicate according to the law

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,090
the dissolution of marriage

49
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,550

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,900

please adjudge more property to the plaintiff.

too much mental stress.

76
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,420
She's in a bad mental state.

The speech you just gave

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,180
doesn't seem like Mu Shiming,

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,980
As journalists,

169
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,440
you need to interview and get some latest news back.

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,020
Stop interviewing for some old stories that have been covered again and again.

171

What are you doing?

172
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,260
Are you putting your hands together to pray?

And you.

There was a multi-car pileup on the Second Ring Highway.

The casualties are still unclear.

182

Also,

183
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,659
there was a fire at the glass factory in the western suburbs.

and the fire had almost been put out before the fire trucks arrived,

197
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,780
then why did the fire trucks still go there?

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,140
It could happen

199

The point is the fire trucks that arrived one after another.

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,590
If I work a little harder every day,

373
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,140
the news award will be a little closer to me.

374
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,390
Dude,

375
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,550
are you paying by cash or transfer?

376
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,150
Transfer.

377
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,210
Coming down now.

378
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,540
Brother.

379
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,500
Aren't you going in to check out your new home?

380
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
Let me mentally prepare for a while.

381
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,670
Okay, I'll pay the bill for you downstairs.

382
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,090
Hello, landlord.

383
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,540
Did you paint

384
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,620
your house a few days ago?

385
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,830
Did the formaldehyde content pass the test?

386
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,720
You can rest assured.

387
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,630
I've tested the formaldehyde.

388
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,940
I could only rent it to you if it met the standard.

389
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,670
There are a few more questions.

390
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,080
The collapse degree of

391
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,960
the sofa in the living room

392
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,190
is over 50 percent.

393
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,200
If I sit there for long,

394
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,250
it will oppress the spine of the body.

395
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,650
So I suggest to change it.

396
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,310
Also, the kitchen ventilator

397
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,540
is too old.

398
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,349
It's very noisy. Listen to it.

399
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,839
So my suggestion is to change it.

400
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
And the bathroom.

401
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,700
It's already 2022.

402
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,870
Why is it not a smart toilet?

403
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,010
So my suggestion is to change it.

404
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,860
As for the single-layer glass in the study,

405
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,620
it's not soundproof.

406
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,080
It affects my work a lot.

407
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,070
So I still suggest to change it.

408
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,130
I rented it to you at such a low price.

409
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,790
If you don't want to live here,

410
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,910
I suggest you change a place to live.

411
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,700
Let's clean it up tomorrow.

412
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,980
We have plenty of time now.

413
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,060
When I get rich,

414
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,620
I'll get rid of this shabby sofa immediately.

415
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,970
[Production Date: September 13, 2021]
[Expiration Date: September 16, 2021]

416
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,770
[Mouth Wash]

417
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,270
I ordered takeout?

418
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Don't drink this much in the future.

419
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,770
Dajun.

420
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,880
Was there a criminal record

421
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,170
of the house you rented for me?

422
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,900
No, brother.

423
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,330
Forget it.

424
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,370
Maybe I was really drunk.

425
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,630
Brother, I'm outside.

426
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Open the door.

427
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,390
You're early.

428
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,210
I bought you breakfast.

429
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,170
Have some.

430
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,630
Let's move after you're done.

431
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,360
Move?

432
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,930
Why?

433
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,000
You know why now, right?

434
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,350
The address here

435
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,590
has been revealed.

436
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,550
Check it out online.

437
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,850
He Zhengyu, get out of the legal profession.

438
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,400
He Zhengyu doesn't deserve to be a lawyer.

439
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,420
He is really unscrupulous for money.

440
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,210
Arrest him.

441
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,390
Alright, stop looking. Let's eat.

442
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,810
Let's find a new place after breakfast.

443
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,890
I won't move.

444
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,160
Why should I?

445
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,210
They're the ones who tried to pick a quarrel.

446
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,740
Why do we need to surrender?

447
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,310
Throw eggs as they want.

448
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,410
I like eggs anyway.

449
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,660
Have some.

450
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:31,810
Eggs.

451
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Let's play an instance afterwards.

452
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,160
You're so thoughtless.

453
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,520
You'll lose your home

454
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,950
during the time you play.

455
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,980
What's the point of worrying?

456
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,780
Let me ask you.

457
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,400
What are you going to do next?

458
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,630
What about it?

459
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,130
As the eldest disciple of the Huashan Sect,

460
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,320
of course I'll work hard

461
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,540
for the peace of the martial arts community.

462
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,330
Stop joking.

463
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm asking about you and...

464
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,320
Dajun.

465
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,960
How many years have we played games together?

466
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,010
I was in sixth grade and you were in eighth grade.

467
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,410
One, two, three.

468
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
-Four, five, six... -Fourteen years.

469
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,450
Fourteen years.

470
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,550
I haven't given up for 14 years.

471
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,270
Do you think I will give up on this case?

472
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,340
I see.

473
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,670
You just have too much time.

474
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,540
We studied law

475
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,660
because we don't want

476
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,120
the society to be in chaos.

477
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,060
With our power,

478
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,030
we want to make the society better.

479
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,220
This is my speech in my sophomore year.

480
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,150
How did you know?

481
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,150
What's so strange about that?

482
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,350
Can't I also want the world

483
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,980
to become a better place?

484
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,950
But not everyone

485
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,640
wants to be the leading actor.

486
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,850
Batman needs Robin too.

487
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,650
Even Sherlock Holmes can't live without Watson.

488
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,510
Di Renjie also needs Yuan Fang.

489
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,880
Top! Hurry!

490
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,220
Ult! Ult!

491
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,980
Right away.

492
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
What's wrong with Jirong?

493
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,940
We've been friends for more than a decade.

494
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,090
We've always trusted each other.

495
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,820
We tell each other everything.

496
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,660
This has never happened before.

497
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,100
Why on earth

498
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,300
did she never answer my calls this time?

499
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,740
Again?

500
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,440
A human or a ghost?

501
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,620
For the sake of the family,

502
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,300
and the reputation of her husband,

503
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,090
grin and bear

504
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,500
the mental and physical pain

505
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,870
brought by a tragic marriage.

506
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,430
For the sake of the family,

507
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,020
and the reputation of her husband,

508
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,570
grin and bear

509
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
the mental and physical pain

510
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,380
brought by a tragic marriage.

511
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,600
Hello.

512
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,330
Female ghost.

513
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,950
Miss.

514
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,740
Are you Sadako or Nie Xiaoqian?

515
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,000
For the sake of the family,

516
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,110
and the reputation of her husband...

517
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,120
Am I disturbing you

518
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:13,920
in your zone?

519
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,910
Bear the tragic marriage...

520
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,550
I'm not the poor scholar.

521
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,560
I'm just going through a hard time.

522
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I'll move out as soon as I get better.

523
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,630
So,

524
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,100
please...

525
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,550
Please let me go.

526
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
I won't let you go.

527
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
This illusion is so real.

528
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,280
I really can't drink anymore.

529
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,050
What's that noise?

530
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,470
Is it a mouse?

531
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,130
The mask I got on sale is quite good.

532
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,070
I just covered a piece of social news just now.

533
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,270
Now I'll read a piece in culture.

534
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,370
The 28th Beijing International Book Fair

535
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,180
will begin on September 14.

536
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,150
This Book Fear...

537
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,060
This Book Fair

538
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,620
themes promoting civilization exchange,

539
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,110
and will be held both online and offline.

540
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,550
I surrender.

541
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,440
I surrender.

542
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,790
I give up.

543
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,740
My defeated opponent.

544
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,200
It's normal.

545
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,180
Even my bones are crispy now.

546
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,300
I only do love but not fight.

547
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,670
How sinful.

548
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,990
I wonder which beautiful girl

549
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,710
is taken down by such a scumbag like you.

550
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,170
It's different this time.

551
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,420
I'm really in love.

552
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,140
Love, you know?

553
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,820
You won't understand.

554
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,780
Little kid.

555
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,770
Then I'd like to welcome the love master,

556
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,830
Jiang Shenghao, to teach me a lesson.

557
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,300
Use your own example

558
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,640
and tell me what love is.

559
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,260
Be serious.

560
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
You know what?

561
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,120
When I first saw her,

562
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,310
with just one glance,

563
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,980
everything around me was gone.

564
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,790
All the people were gone.

565
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,990
Everything was gone.

566
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,400
It was a chaos.

567
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,740
Only she shined brightly in front of me.

568
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,060
From that moment on, I've decided that

569
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,120
this woman is definitely

570
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,580
going to be my wife.

571
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,200
Do you know what you look like now?

572
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,540
A daydreamer.

573
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,790
I shouldn't have told you.

574
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,210
Listen to me.

575
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,590
Have you ever seen me being so serious?

576
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,080
You've talked so much.

577
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,060
You'd better be serious this time.

578
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
Chen Jialan.

579
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,040
Just wait to be my bridesmaid.

580
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,110
What? You're getting married?

581
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,620
Yes.

582
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,300
That's great.

583
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:19,840
Well.

584
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,420
Why are you so happy that I'm getting married?

585
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,620
Then I can wear pretty dresses for free.

586
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,730
You can wear anything.

587
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,310
Because no matter what, you'll be standing next to the bride.

588
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,770
It's good enough if you don't feel inferior.

589
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,500
Did you find yourself a fairy?

590
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,330
Indeed.

591
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,500
It's her.

592
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,790
Keep it down.

593
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,780
How could it be her?

594
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,170
Can it be fake?

595
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,679
Do you deserve her?

596
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,219
What do you mean?

597
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,230
Look at me. So handsome and cool.

598
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,180
Listen.

599
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,370
Don't tell anyone.

600
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,630
She's a public figure.

601
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,520
All right. A meal to seal my mouth.

602
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,200
All right. Let's go.

603
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,320
What do you want to eat?

604
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,850
The restaurant near my house, of course.

605
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,780
Jiang Shenghao said in court that

606
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,250
Chen Kexin perjured herself.

607
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,140
The most important thing now is to find Chen Kexin to testify in court.

608
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,940
That's right.

609
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,790
Leave it to me.

610
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,570
Move.

611
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,420
No.

612
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,670
Enough.

613
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,290
Jiang Shenghao, enough.

614
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,740
-If you keep being like this, I... -Jirong.

615
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,340
Come here.

616
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,880
Jirong, I'll take you home.

617
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,620
Jiang Shenghao. Enough.

618
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,340
Stop it!

619
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,770
-Move! -Jiang Shenghao.

620
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,540
Listen to me.

621
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,030
You have hurt Jirong once.

622
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,350
As her lawyer,

623
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,460
I will never allow you

624
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
to hurt her again.

625
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,700
As for how you threatened her

626
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,980
and forced her to retract her testimony,

627
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,580
I will find out the truth.

628
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,740
Leave now.

629
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,540
Anwen.

630
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,860
You have the right to call the police now.

631
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,210
Okay.

632
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,900
Thank you, Zhengyu.

633
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
It's okay, Anwen.

634
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,950
Is Jirong feeling better?

635
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,970
You should go back too.

636
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,850
Jirong just got better.

637
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,010
No, Anwen.

638
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,080
In this situation,

639
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,290
I must see Jirong.

640
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,370
I promise I won't push her buttons.

641
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,030
Just do her a favor.

642
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,540
She really needs to rest.

643
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,250
But only Jirong knows

644
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,130
what happened.

645
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,860
She admitted in court that

646
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
the evidence she provided was fake.

647
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,830
You said it yourself that

648
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,370
it must have been Jiang Shenghao

649
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,340
playing some tricks.

650
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,540
That's only my guess.

651
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,240
Also, she apologized to me

652
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,580
in front of the court that day.

653
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,200
No interviews. Thank you.

654
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,820
Thank you.

655
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,180
Zhengyu.

656
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,210
I know you meant well.

657
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,660
You want to help Jirong.

658
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,200
But

659
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,460
Jirong just fell asleep.

660
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,130
Let her have a good rest.

661
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,380
Let's talk tomorrow.

662
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,930
No. I shouldn't drink more.

663
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,250
Go to bed early, or I'll see a ghost again.

664
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,390
Ghost!

665
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,270
Ghost! Ghost!

666
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,890
[Sweet ON]
[Love in Time]
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

667
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,160
[I'm not afraid.]

668
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,380
[Sneaky]

669
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,180
[One action]

670
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,400
So tough.

671
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,220
[What's that? Where am I?]

672
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,340
[Scared a bit]

673
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:14,600
[Getting real]

674
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,990
[Men can't give in]

675
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,570
My defeated opponent.

676
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,760
[Burp]

677
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,660
-Are you full? -Yes.

678
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,320
[Grabbing]

679
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,180
[Whose is this?]

680
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,070
[Why was it thrown away?]

681
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
[Quite interesting]

682
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,000
[Get it back]
