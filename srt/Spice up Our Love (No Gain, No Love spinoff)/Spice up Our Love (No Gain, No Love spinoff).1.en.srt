00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,165
Kim Do-gyeom.

2
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,627
Today…

3
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,670
you'll be a dead man.

4
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,387
Okay, let go of the knife.

5
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,140
Let go of the knife first.

6
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,475
Okay, I let it go.

7
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,060
All right, calm down.

8
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,520
Wait, wait!

9
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,146
-This is so unfair!
-Okay!

10
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,684
SEO YEON-SEO, AGE 29
MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

11
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,893
JOB: NUTRITIONIST

12
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,645
MOTTO: "EAT WHAT IS GIVEN"

13
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,357
Today was our one-year anniversary,

14
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,484
but he was feeding another woman.

15
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,946
I went the extra mile
to make a reservation at that restaurant.

16
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,328
Damn, that bastard.
He was wearing the watch I bought him.

17
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,250
Still, you can't walk around with a knife.

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,168
What is that? Is that blood?

19
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,715
Beets. It's beet juice.

20
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,011
What? Now, calm down
and tell us what happened.

21
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,470
Take a deep breath.

22
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,930
Exhale.

23
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,810
Beet.

24
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,490
She asked for a beat.

25
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,326
I didn't mean "beat."

26
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,161
I meant beet, a type of root vegetable.

27
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,204
Beets have red pigment that has betaine,

28
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,873
which acts as an antioxidant,

29
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,500
which may help prevent cancer
and reduce inflammation.

30
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,961
Oh, right.
You said you were a nutritionist.

31
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,839
But why were you chopping beets
on your anniversary?

32
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,302
My boss won't eat my sausages.

33
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,012
What?

34
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:45,267
My freaking boss won't
freaking eat my sausages.

35
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,815
Sausages are basically made
of 90% or more pork base,

36
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,944
filled with eggs, onions,
and Cheongyang chili pepper

37
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,528
among other ingredients,

38
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,865
and pressed tightly into a casing.

39
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:03,953
But beets, kabocha squash…

40
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,205
Wait, what was this again?

41
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,583
Anyway, since I've been working
for this bastard of a boss

42
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,752
with bizarre taste buds,
I have tried everything.

43
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,963
But the result has been…

44
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,339
Again.

45
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,216
Again.

46
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,426
Again.

47
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,261
Again!

48
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,180
Again!

49
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,224
Again!

50
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,108
Every day, that bastard wants
sausages served at lunch

51
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,528
until I can replicate the taste
of the sausage that he had as a kid.

52
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,946
-Every day?
-Yeah.

53
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,823
But still, who puts beets in sausages?

54
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,911
What am I supposed to do?
I don't even eat sausages.

55
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,665
I've tried every possibility for a boss
whose face I've never seen,

56
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,166
but he keeps saying it's wrong.

57
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,879
The reason my boyfriend is cheating on me
is because of that bastard.

58
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,674
The son of a bitch
who's obsessed with sausages.

59
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,763
-I think she's lost it.
-Yeah.

60
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,898
THE NEXT DAY

61
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,234
-What is it today?
-What kind of sausage is this?

62
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,069
-It has beets in it.
-Yuck.

63
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,237
Beets? Oh, man…

64
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,284
Jeez. Why do the sausages
always look like this?

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,206
Hey, Kim Do-gyeom!

66
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,877
What did you just…

67
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,677
-Is she mad?
-What is wrong with her?

68
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,220
What the hell are you doing?

69
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,474
Killing you with kindness, perhaps?

70
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,977
Well, thank you very much.

71
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,812
Hold on.

72
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:59,193
I'd like to talk to you
about the boss's meals, Secretary Kim.

73
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,821
I don't have much time.
Let's talk on our way up.

74
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,452
The doors are closing.

75
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,871
Go on. The food will get cold.

76
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,500
I don't know exactly where to start, but--

77
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,501
Let's break up.

78
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,881
Did you not hear me?
I said, let's break up.

79
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,260
Yeah, I was going to say the same thing.

80
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,638
But I deserve to know why.

81
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,223
Is it because of that woman?

82
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,352
I saw you at the restaurant I had reserved
for us with another woman.

83
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,355
The food there was so good.

84
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,649
Thanks.

85
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,693
It must've been hard
to make a reservation there.

86
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,199
Fine, I admit
that I missed our anniversary

87
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:51,245
and made you feel lonely
because I was working late.

88
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,621
Even so, how can you cheat--

89
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,915
You think people cheat
because they're lonely?

90
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,836
They cheat when they get bored.

91
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,004
What?

92
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,716
Yeon-seo, you know the employees
don't eat your sausages, right?

93
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,303
People got sick of eating it
after just a few weeks,

94
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,180
but I had to endure it for a year.

95
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,100
What?

96
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,019
This is over. I'm done.

97
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,187
Kim Do-gyeom, you…

98
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,023
The doors are opening.

99
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,825
Thank you for your hard work, Miss Seo.

100
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,470
He's sick of me? I'm boring?

101
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,640
How about this for a little excitement?

102
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,767
How about I take a bite out of you?

103
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,353
Woof, woof.

104
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,940
Again.

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
My apologies.

106
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,912
I'll make you another.

107
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,873
"Again"?

108
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,795
That bastard sounds just like my boss.

109
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,090
Do it again.

110
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,508
Do it again.

111
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,472
-Again.
-Again.

112
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,016
-Again!
-Again.

113
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,644
-Again.
-Again!

114
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,012
You there.

115
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,766
You, "Again."

116
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,066
Are you calling me?

117
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,067
Yes.

118
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:31,989
Do I know you?

119
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,282
Does it matter?

120
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:37,202
I just have something to ask you.

121
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,668
Listen, why don't you just stuff your face
with what people give you?

122
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,047
"Stuff my face"?

123
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,342
The taste from your childhood,
the unforgettable taste of nostalgia.

124
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,345
Why does any of that matter?

125
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,056
Here's the thing.

126
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,225
Do you know I spent months
working overtime,

127
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,560
never seeing my boyfriend,

128
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,855
just so I can make sausages
I don't even like

129
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,776
in search of a flavor I've never tasted?

130
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,113
On top of that,
I saw him with another woman…

131
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,909
If it weren't for the bastard
who's obsessed with sausages,

132
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,703
I could've been a better girlfriend.

133
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,246
And he wouldn't have gotten bored.

134
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,252
So, instead of looking for what you ate
as a child, try some other--

135
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,587
I never get bored.

136
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,430
Whether it's the flavors I love
or the women I fall for,

137
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,891
I don't get bored.

138
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:44,811
Never.

139
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,187
Won't you regret this?
I don't do this with drunk women.

140
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,275
I don't do this with men
whose names I don't know either.

141
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,487
Let's call it a one-day workshop.

142
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,099
Two hundred thousand won?

143
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,119
You lunatic.

144
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,247
You absolute lunatic.

145
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,210
Have you gone insane
after that son of a bitch hurt you?

146
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,837
But why? Seriously, why?

147
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,019
"To the CEO's office"?

148
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,231
What for? Am I in the doghouse?

149
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,318
Because of sausages?

150
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,360
CEO'S OFFICE

151
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,988
Instead of making the ex-boyfriend
regret dumping me…

152
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,126
He's not in.

153
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,796
SECRETARY KIM DO-GYEOM

154
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,007
Where did he go?

155
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,092
Come in.

156
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,940
Miss Seo Yeon-seo?

157
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,858
Yes, Mr. Kang.

158
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,998
I am Kang Ha-jun.

159
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,501
I am so screwed…

160
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,716
Judging by the look on your face,
I guess you really didn't know.

161
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,221
Well, you wouldn't have spoken to me
that way if you had known.

162
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,557
Not to your boss…

163
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,394
who pays you.

164
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,904
Was it only worth 200,000 won?

165
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,198
Was I?

166
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,496
What do you mean, "200,000 won"?

167
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,918
So you're pretending not to remember?

168
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:39,588
That's boring.

169
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,506
What did you say?

170
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,135
I said you might get fired for that.

171
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,933
Well, since you're going to fire me,
let me give you a word of advice.

172
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,893
Okay, let's hear it.

173
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:59,399
Just eat the shit people make for you,
you fussy bastard.

174
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,945
And also, give me back
my freaking 180,000 won.

175
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,283
You want change?

176
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,828
It wasn't worth 200,000 won.
It was 20,000 won at best.

177
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,253
I'm screwed.

178
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,297
So screwed.

179
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,133
All because of this damn sausage.

180
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,138
And because of that damn CEO.

181
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,557
But why is that jerk here?

182
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,644
Am I really getting fired?

183
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,980
I still have installments to pay
for Kim Do-gyeom, that bastard's watch.

184
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,403
From today, Mr. Kang will have breakfast
with the employees.

185
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,580
From today, Mr. Kang will have lunch
with the employees.

186
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,045
From today, Mr. Kang will have dinner--

187
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,547
Are you going to eat all three meals
with the employees?

188
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,424
Yes, will that be a problem?

189
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,427
We don't serve sausages
for dinner, Mr. Kang.

190
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,348
Then I'll stuff my face
with whatever you give me.

191
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,560
It really doesn't matter
if I don't get to eat sausages, right?

192
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,527
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Kang.

193
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,531
It feels different seeing you at work,

194
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,617
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

195
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,827
Sorry?

196
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,578
How do you know Yeon-seo…

197
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,831
I mean, Miss Seo?

198
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,626
I took a one-day workshop.

199
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,879
With Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

200
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,466
"One-day workshop"?

201
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,344
Mr. Kim. It seems
I left my phone at my desk.

202
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,430
Yes, sir.

203
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,110
I assume you're trying to make me quit,
but I won't cave.

204
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,405
Before you fire me, I'll make sure
you get sick of the food here.

205
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,698
Did you forget what I said?

206
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,033
I won't get sick of it.

207
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,870
I'm going to make
the exact same meal every time.

208
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,996
I told you,

209
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,917
I never grow bored
of the women I fall for.

210
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,807
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

211
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,769
Mr. Kang.

212
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,648
You said there was a problem
with the meals?

213
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,317
I think I need to reduce the budget.

214
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,570
It's much too nutritious.

215
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,490
Not a chance.

216
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,409
It was really hard
to stay within the budget.

217
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,329
Then why does this happen?

218
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,421
This is because of the cafeteria food?

219
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,131
Since I started eating at the cafeteria,

220
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,217
this keeps happening at random.
So why else?

221
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,384
Or…

222
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,678
did you put something in my food?

223
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,225
I don't play around with food.

224
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,313
But I do with other things.

You naughty girl, are you an author?

230
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,584
Ha-fox is such a heartthrob!

231
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,337
I'll hold my breath
until the end of the story!

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,589

reading the comments all of a sudden?

236
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,058
Miss Yeon Bo-ra.

237
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,687
Spice Up Our Love has many more fans.

238
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,689
You're the best. You know that, right?

239
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,526
Did Hae-yeong tell you…

240
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,408
that I sued one of the haters?

241
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,871
Don't let it get to you.

242
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,961
That loser's probably a total recluse
who never leaves his room.

243
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,924
Don't take any settlements
or allow lenity. You're rich, right?

244
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:35,925
I am rich.

Okay.

LETTER OF APOLOGY
BOK GYU-HYUN, OCTOBER 11, 1991

260
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,739
Miss Yeon.

261
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,664
What the hell are you doing?

262
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,291
Did you think
a handwritten letter of apology

263
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,293
would make me forget you told me to die?

264
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,670
I never told you to die.

265
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,883
I didn't have such malicious intent.

266
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,760
"Such malicious intent"?

267
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,764
So your comment wasn't meant
to be murderous, just hurtful?

268
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:50,309
You want me to feel hurt as you intended
and just get over it?

269
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,689
I don't need a letter of apology.

270
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,985
There'll be no settlement or lenity.

271
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,030
If that's what you want.

272
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,619
Forget settlement or lenity.

273
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,580
But I meant every word…

274
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,416
in the letter.

275
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,503
I sincerely admit my wrongdoing,
and I wanted to apologize sincerely.

276
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,213
"Sincerely"?

277
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,507
What can I do to get you to believe me?

278
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,760
If there's anything I can do,
I'll do it right--

279
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,886
Then die.

280
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,013
What?

281
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,473
I said, die.

282
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,558
That's a bit harsh.

283
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,685
You said that to me over a hundred times.

284
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,190
Your comments made me wonder
if I deserved to die over a hundred times.

285
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:44,030
Now, it's your turn to wonder
if you deserve to live.

286
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,492
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

287
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,620
Are you awake? Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

288
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,748
Do you see this light? Do you see it?

289
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:21,043
Now, follow the light
with your eyes if you can.

290
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,046
Aren't you the manager
at that convenience store?

291
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,924
Where am I?

292
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,052
You're at a hospital.
You fainted and lost consciousness.

293
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,515
So I fainted. I'm not dead.

294
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,392
If you had died,

295
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,979
I would've died too
at the hands of CEO Kang Ha-jun.

296
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,358
But why do you keep calling me
"Seo Yeon-seo?"

297
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,113
How do you know Seo Yeon-seo?

298
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,949
Because I am looking
at Miss Seo Yeon-seo right now.

299
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,703
You're looking at Seo Yeon-seo?

300
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,873
Last time, I saw you with Mr. Kang.

301
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,795
You're a fan of Spice Up Our Love.

302
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,216
Thank you, Mr. Manager.

303
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,635
I'm not a manager.
I'm the director of this hospital.

304
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,721
You might still feel dizzy.
Rest here for a while.

305
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,725
Doctor Kim,
give her a thiamine injection and glucose.

306
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,602
Give those to her.

307
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,863
This room looks very expensive.

308
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,908
Don't they have shared rooms?

309
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,419
What's with my hair?

310
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,011
How long was I out?

311
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,891
What month… No, what year is it right now?

312
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,060
My phone.

313
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,108
Whose clothes are these?

314
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,283
Seo Yeon-seo?

315
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,328
Miss Seo Yeon-seo. Are you conscious?

316
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,579
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

317
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,541
Because I am looking
at Miss Seo Yeon-seo now.

318
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,565
You saw the anonymous online forum, right?

319
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,482
Yes.

320
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,736
That's her. She did all sorts of things
to seduce CEO Kang Ha-jun.

321
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:52,653
VIP
SEO **** SEO

322
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,196
That's why she's in a VIP suite.

323
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,764
Seo Yeon-seo.

324
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,391
I'm Seo Yeon-seo?

325
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:26,771
This must be a dream.

326
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,399
If I just go home, go to bed, and wake up…

327
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,741
The hater?

328
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,330
What are you doing here?
Director Oh said you needed rest.

329
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,415
Did you bring me to the hospital?

330
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,250
Yes.

331
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,627
I thought… I mean,

332
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,922
I passed out because of you, right?

333
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,591
You could say that.

334
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,551
It happened because of me.

335
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,512
Thank goodness.

336
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,972
I had it all wrong.

337
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,766
You seemed fine,

338
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,936
but I had no idea how stressed you were
until you passed out.

339
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,229
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

340
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,190
What…

341
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,527
What did you just say?

342
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,113
My people deleted all those posts
on the online forum.

343
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,157
I'm sorry, Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

344
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,787
I'm… Seo Yeon-seo?

345
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,835
Then… am I really in Spice Up Our Love?

346
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,546
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

347
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,965
Yes, Director Oh.

348
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,718
What…

349
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:41,929
What did he just call you?

350
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,348
What's the matter, Miss Seo Yeon-seo?

351
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:49,311
Whether it's the flavors I love
or the women I fall for…

352
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,526
I never get bored.

353
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,778
Never.

354
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,947
Won't you regret this?

355
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,326
I don't do this with drunk women.

356
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,204
What's wrong, Miss Seo Yeon-seo?

357
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:10,124
You're really the CEO of GB Electric.

358
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,127
I'm Kang Ha-jun.

359
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,547
KANG HA-JUN, AGE 33
THE MOST HANDSOME MAN

360
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,631
CEO OF GB ELECTRIC

361
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,966
MOTTO: "I NEVER GET BORED"

362
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,348
Miss Seo, it's too early for you
to get discharged. Go back in and--

363
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,353
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

364
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,522
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

365
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,025
No way.

366
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:39,528
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

367
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,699
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

368
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,409
Wait for me!

369
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,704
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

370
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,171
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

371
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,845
So the hater is Kang Ha-jun?

372
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,271
SONG JOONG-KI'S COFFEE OF CHOICE

373
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,485
Why is he Song Joong-ki?

374
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,710
What? Cha Eun-woo?

375
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:37,795
"TRUE MALE BEAUTY"

376
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,129
Why are they all that hater?

377
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,047
SMOOTH SUGAR

378
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,132
That's impossible. Damn it.

379
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,680
How does this make any sense?

380
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,974
Why are they all that hater? Huh?

381
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,059
How can he be my Ha-jun?

382
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:58,941
How can he be Ha-jun?

383
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,239
Wait. This place…

384
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,291
Transfer passenger.

385
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,459
Why are they getting back on?

386
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,086
What's going on?

387
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,714
What is this?

388
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,437
Transfer passenger.

389
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,564
Transfer passenger.

390
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,442
Sir.

391
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,870
You went from a doctor to a bus driver.

392
00:31:54,872 --> 00:32:00,127
Anyway, why does this bus
only stop in front of the hospital?

393
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,670
This episode takes place here.

394
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,798
"This episode"?

395
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,302
There's a critical scene coming up.

396
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,347
"A critical scene"?

397
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,816
What is that sound?

398
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,328
Huh? This is…

399
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,914
This is from Spice Up Our Love.

400
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,124
Why is this…

401
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,584
HA-JUN LOOKED AT YEON-SEO…

402
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,294
SHE KNEW WHAT HE WAS FEELING…

403
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,557
Stop it! Go away!

404
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,767
I said, stop it!

405
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:58,727
What's happening?

406
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,396
I have no control over my body.

407
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,148
No, this can't be happening.

408
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,321
Don't let those malicious comments
get to you.

409
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,323
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

410
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,492
You're the one who hurt me.

411
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,702
No matter what they say,

412
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,706
I'm the one who fell for you first.

413
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,960
I like you, Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

414
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:29,341
Not everything
on the online forum is a lie.

415
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,801
Wait, this dialogue…

416
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,470
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

417
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,013
They say…

418
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,391
…is from the kiss scene that I wrote.

419
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,726
…"Seo Yeon-seo's body"…

420
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,477
Jeez, Seo Yeon-seo. Shut up.

421
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,396
I said, shut up!

422
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:44,898
"…drives Mr. Kang crazy."

423
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,191
CRAZY!

424
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,611
Don't do it.

425
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,155
Please don't do it!

426
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,704
No!

427
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:11,592
No, wait.

428
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,891
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

429
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,350
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

430
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,488
I should be killing that hater,
but a kiss?

431
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,370
This episode takes place here.

432
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,081
There's a critical scene coming up.

433
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:49,379
So critical scenes will happen,
no matter what.

434
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,009
And I have no control over my body?

435
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,641
Well, those scenes drive the stories
of a mature-content web novel.

436
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,728
But why can't I resist it
even though I'm the writer?

437
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,565
Hold on.

438
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,652
So for the upcoming scene…

439
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,447
Yeon-seo's discharged from the hospital.

440
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,784
Then, at the end…

441
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,479
I'm screwed.

442
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,069
-Did you see Kang Ha-jun's face?
-Didn't you hear?

443
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,821
He fought with his girlfriend.

444
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,243
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

445
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,749
Miss Seo Yeon-seo, are you in there?

446
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,501
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

447
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,505
The patient is female,
170 cm in height, and weighs--

448
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,215
Director Oh. Her weight?

449
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,427
Is it a bit rude?

450
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,806
Miss Seo Yeon-seo has long, straight hair,

451
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,142
and she is the world's cutest, loveliest--

452
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,310
And most unstable woman.

453
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,145
We must find her quickly.

454
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,443
Miss Seo Yeon-seo,
why do you keep disappearing?

455
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,944
I can't keep you locked up.

456
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,656
Of course you can.

457
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:43,660
So she stops disappearing.

458
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,088
STRESS
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!

459
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,432
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

460
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,733
-Miss Seo Yeon-seo.
-Stay away!

461
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,234
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

462
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,028
Miss Seo Yeon-seo, wait!

463
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,112
I said, stay away!

464
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,427
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

465
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,850
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

466
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:50,978
Good God.

467
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,314
No fair, you have a scooter!

468
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,568
I mean, if I am the writer,

469
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:01,405
am I not the god
that created this universe?

470
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,532
But I can't do anything I want.

471
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,620
I'm no god at all.

472
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,665
I'm going to be stuck in a naked scene!

473
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,003
Miss Seo Yeon-seo, are you listening?

474
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,755
-This is Kang Ha-jun.
-Kang Ha-jun.

475
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,718
Playing hide-and-seek has been fun,
but you need to rest now, so come back.

476
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,554
Miss Seo Yeon-seo in the women's bathroom
on the fourth floor.

477
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,394
How on earth can I get out of this place?

478
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,275
FALLING HAZARD

479
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,027
"You are this world's lead character.

480
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,615
When the lead character dies,
this world ends too."

481
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,286
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, it's… it's dangerous!

482
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,829
-Get down from there!
-Hey!

483
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,832
Don't do it! Come on down!

484
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,797
Excuse me.

485
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,760
Miss Seo Yeon-seo, don't do it!

486
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,305
Director Oh, get an ambulance on standby
and dispatch a helicopter. Now!

487
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,639
Okay.

488
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:17,147
When the lead character dies,
the story ends.

489
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,027
If I die as Seo Yeon-seo,
I will go back to being Nam Ja-yeon.

490
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,904
Seo Yeon-seo!

491
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:31,161
You go back to being a hater!

492
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,081
How dare you play my Ha-jun.

493
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,085
I almost died.

494
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,462
Oh, right. I need to die.

495
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,855
Nam Ja-yeon, you can do it.

496
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,441
One.

497
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,027
Two.

498
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,781
Three!

499
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,200
No!

500
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,338
Huh?

501
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:25,549
What?

502
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,342
Get away!

503
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,552
Get away from me!

504
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,346
No!

505
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,639
No…

506
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,755
Damn you, male lead character.

507
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,351
What a man.

508
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,319
You're the best!

509
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,406
Am I possessed?

510
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,117
I wake up, and I'm the female lead
of my own story.

511
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,453
One, critical scenes will happen
no matter what.

512
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,247
Two, when the music cues the start
of the scene, I can't move.

513
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,333
Three, the lead character never dies.

514
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,669
If I cannot die,

515
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,634
that hater also cannot die
because of plot armor.

516
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:54,304
Does that mean I must act out
the last scene with that hater?

517
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,515
This is the worst.

518
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,517
The absolute worst.

519
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,319
No!

520
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,699
WITH THE SOUND OF A KNOCK…

521
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,201
TONIGHT… THE FEEL OF OIL…

522
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,661
…AND A SPECIAL DATE NIGHT…

523
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,870
YEON-SEO SMILED IN SATISFACTION…

524
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,838
The story has taken control of me again.

525
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,175
No, I don't want you.

526
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:33,885
Stay away.

527
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,553
What the hell?

528
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,597
Why are you looking at me like that?

529
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,603
Peep show.

530
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,732
Peep show.

531
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,318
Peep show.

532
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:52,988
Peep show.

533
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,294
What?

534
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,963
Didn't this episode end
with an oil massage?

535
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:14,217
I have no memory of it.

536
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,094
I'm fine with avoiding the last scene…

537
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,305
Hold on.

538
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,308
If I don't do the last scene…

539
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,647
doesn't that mean I can't get out of this?

540
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,402
I BECAME THE FEMALE LEAD
OF A NOVEL WHEN I OPENED MY EYES

541
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,286
DISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA

542
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:43,747
I knew it.

543
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:51,880
Good morning.

544
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,424
Just so you know, when I write MR stories…

545
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,508
MR: MODERN ROMANCE

546
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,093
Would you like coffee, or…

547
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,597
…they always have a happy ending.

548
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,354
Would you like to go out for breakfast?

549
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,191
If I reach the end of this scene…

550
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,109
If you don't want to go out…

551
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,489
Maybe I can get out of here.

552
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:21,034
Kang Ha-jun.

553
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,251
Shall we…

554
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,420
do the last scene?

555
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:46,810
The last scene?

556
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,633
Yeo… Yeo Ha-jun?

557
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,053
What is my first love doing here?

558
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,234
