1
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,292
Shall we do the last scene?

2
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,092
The last scene?

3
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,059
Wait!

4
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,814
I don't think I'm ready yet.

5
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,149
But I'm totally ready.

6
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,124
I can do this with drunk women,

7
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,711
but I really don't do this

8
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,755
with sick women.

9
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,883
I will do everything you want,

10
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,761
but for the time being…

11
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,526
Yeo… Yeo Ha-jun?

12
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,985
It's Kang Ha-jun.

13
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,072
Secretary Kim.
You can't show up without notice.

14
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,449
If I just show up here,
wouldn't it be for a reason?

15
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,034
Still, how can a secretary--

16
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,161
Wait. Hold on.

17
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,415
Don't tell me that Yeo Ha-jun is…

18
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,544
I mean, that man is Secretary Kim?

19
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,379
Do you not remember Mr. Kim?

20
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,714
I doubt you don't remember me,

21
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,967
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

22
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,471
So you're saying that you are really…

23
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,307
I'm Kim Do-gyeom.

24
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,772
You know the employees
don't eat your sausages, right?

25
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,859
People got sick of eating it
after just a few weeks,

26
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,155
but I had to endure it for a year.

27
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,745
This is impossible. My Yeo Ha-jun.

28
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,581
My Ha-jun.

29
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,707
I'm Kang Ha-jun.

30
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,710
So it was urgent?

31
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,713
Why else would I be here
in this awkward situation?

32
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,672
Then you deal with it!

33
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,925
Sir, did you not hear what I just said?

34
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:55,968
It's urgent--

35
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,512
If it were, you wouldn't be
standing there, would you?

36
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,639
I have something very urgent
I need to tend to.

37
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,184
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.
Let's go to the hospital first.

38
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,269
This can't be happening.

39
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,687
You're not Do-gyeom.

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,648
You're just not. You can't be, got it?

41
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,487
You seduced Kang Ha-jun,

42
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,115
and now you're pretending to be delirious?

43
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:24,330
You won't go away so easily, will you?
Seo Yeon-seo.

44
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,879
Stop the car.
I don't need to go to a hospital.

45
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,005
I'm perfectly fine.

46
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,467
Do you know how startled I was just now?

47
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,303
-I thought something was wrong with you--
-Something is wrong

48
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,221
with you and not me, Mr. Hater.

49
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,269
I'm pretty sure that hater's name
was Bok Gyu-hyun.

50
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,980
That man must have died for real.

51
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,816
And now, I'm being punished for it.

52
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,526
You're "being punished"?

53
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,282
Bok Gyu-hyun, the hater, is Kang Ha-jun,

54
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,410
and my Yeo Ha-jun is Kim Do-gyeom.

55
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,957
This is hell for me.

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,167
Wait.

57
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:16,131
Me being Kang Ha-jun is
punishment and hell for you?

58
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,970
I mean,

59
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,514
who on earth is Yeo Ha-jun?

60
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,059
My first love.

61
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,897
I wrote Spice Up Our Love
thinking about Yeo Ha-jun.

62
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,816
That's why I used the name "Ha-jun."

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,986
But now, I'm stuck in Seo Yeon-seo's body,

64
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,905
and my Yeo Ha-jun
is Kim Do-gyeom of all people.

65
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:44,702
And the man who attacked you online
happens to be me, of all people?

66
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,789
You don't believe me, do you?

67
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,791
I do.

68
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,210
I believe everything you say.

69
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,087
Really?

70
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,171
Of course.

71
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,299
Hey! You said you believed me.

72
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,718
How is this believing someone?

73
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,804
You bastard,
just you wait until I'm out of here.

74
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,182
You'll break character
and face awful situations.

75
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,642
I'll make your life hell!

76
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,979
Will Miss Yeon-seo be okay?

77
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,734
Kang Ha-jun! You're worse than the hater!

78
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,447
What did Director Oh say?

79
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,743
Thankfully, there's no issue with
your brain, and your memories are intact.

80
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,620
See? I told you I was perfectly fine.

81
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,164
Do you still not believe me?

82
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,290
I believe you.

83
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,459
Except the parts
about the novel and the hater?

84
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,840
-Where are you going?
-To my house.

85
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,637
Miss Seo Yeon-seo, do you even have money?

86
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,115
How can I act out
a happy ending with the hater

87
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,659
while my first love
is right before my eyes?

88
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,455
I have to get out of this world.

89
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,584
But what can I do to get out of here?

90
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,595
We've arrived.

91
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,056
Sir, this isn't the place…

92
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,142
The convenience store… I mean,

93
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,145
Director Oh? No, the bus driver?

94
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,648
A bus driver? No. A taxi driver? Yes.

95
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,192
Go. This is where we are in this episode.

96
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,861
"This episode"?

97
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,155
The final scene of this episode.

98
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,742
"The final scene of this episode"?

99
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,494
Is anybody there?

100
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,955
Hello?

101
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,041
Hello!

102
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,001
Wait, Mr. Multiple Roles.

103
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,003
If you know something, can you tell me…

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,631
exactly…

105
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,799
Aren't you getting out?

106
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,473
I must be the only one who comes to work
to get locked up in the freezer room.

107
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,061
It's not like I can change the last scene.

108
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,229
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

109
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,773
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

110
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,945
Look at that man.

111
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,281
He's so pretty.

112
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,956
I thought you were going home.

113
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,708
Did you miss me already?

114
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,293
Absolutely not.

115
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,379
I think you did.

116
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,840
Yes.

117
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,593
What the hell?

118
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,304
Hello, Mr. Kang.

119
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,017
Whenever they serve pork cutlets
in the cafeteria,

120
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,228
something good always happens.

121
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:07,070
SPICE UP OUR LOVE, EPISODE 102

122
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,031
PORK. CUTLET.
THAT WAS A SECRET LANGUAGE

123
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,283
ON THE DAYS PORK CUTLETS
WERE SERVED,

124
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,619
I WAITED FOR HER IN OUR SPACE

125
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,121
AND WE SPENT A NIGHT SO HOT
WE COULD FLOAT IN THE HEAT

126
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:20,834
IT WAS OUR EXPRESS TRAIN
TO HEAVEN

127
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,295
Oh, damn it.

128
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,802
Enjoy your food, Mr. Kim.

129
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,153
Miss Seo Yeon-seo is so silly.

130
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,990
An "X" at the office cafeteria?

131
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,664
Mr. Kim. You know
what this "X" means, right?

132
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,832
Jerk, asshole, bastard.

133
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,334
How undignified of you.

134
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,503
This means…

135
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,258
a kiss.

136
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,060
Hey!

137
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,144
Enjoy your meal.

138
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,772
Kiss.

139
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,699
You out of your damn mind?

140
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,618
You pretended not to know me this morning.

141
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,453
Now, you flirt with me in front of him?

142
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,497
No, it's not what you think.

143
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,042
I'm just happy to see you here.

144
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,503
And I know how much you like pork cutlets.

145
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,256
Why don't you just tell Ha-jun
that we used to date?

146
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,842
You're just trying to mess with me.

147
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,219
The pot calling the kettle black.

148
00:09:56,054 --> 00:10:00,600
Are you using me to make Ha-jun jealous?

149
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,562
Why? Is he getting sick of you too?

150
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:07,274
Then again, why would Kang Ha-jun
ever think you're good enough for him?

151
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,568
Don't try too hard, Seo Yeon-seo.

152
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,903
You're just a plaything for Kang Ha-jun.

153
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,448
Before you know it,
he'll be done with you.

154
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,993
Kim Do-gyeom, you're…

155
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,165
cute even when you're being mean as hell.

156
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,833
You look like my Ha-jun, after all.

157
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,670
I wish you were the male lead instead.

158
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,715
You could become the regretful ex.

159
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,051
Many side characters take the girl
from the lead.

160
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,890
Are you saying you want
to get back with me now?

161
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,771
Listen.

162
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,398
I was chewing gum and spat it out,

163
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,817
and then someone else chewed it
and spat it out.

164
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,528
So why would I put it back in my mouth?

165
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,030
What?

166
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,117
You're just a piece of gum
me and Ha-jun once chewed.

167
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,578
Nothing more, nothing less. Know your…

168
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,667
What on earth are you doing?

169
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,836
Ha-jun. Are you all right?

170
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,922
I'm Ha-jun!

171
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,095
The man who loves you and the man you love

172
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,554
is me, Kang Ha-jun.

173
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,681
The truth is,

174
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,767
I am not all right at all.

175
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:25,977
Seo Yeon-seo.

176
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,605
All because of you.

177
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,025
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

178
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,792
Damn it.

179
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,461
Ha-jun.

180
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,840
When you say, "Ha-jun," do you mean me?

181
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,260
Yes. The person holding my hand,
Kang Ha-jun.

182
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,306
You're really hurting my hand.

183
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,269
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

184
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,523
Listen, don't be so harsh on Do-gyeom.

185
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,734
Miss Seo Yeon-seo,
he treated you terribly, but you're just--

186
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,113
Do-gyeom acts that way only because
he is the villain in this novel.

187
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,366
I made him into a total jerk.

188
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,744
It's that novel again.

189
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,624
You're rich, you're straightforward,
and you're also hyper…

190
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,710
What are you trying to say?

191
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,297
I'm hyper, and you don't like that?

192
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,508
I meant, you're also hypersexual.

193
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,760
HYPERSEXUAL MAN: MALE LEAD
WHO IS OUTSTANDING (IN BED)

194
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:45,015
Anyway, you feeling like you
can't live without Yeon-seo

195
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,893
is a part of my novel,
into which I poured my heart.

196
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,228
I know you don't believe me.

197
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:55,442
How can you expect me
to believe such utter nonsense?

198
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,365
You have your car keys, right?

199
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,035
Yes.

200
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,800
Miss Seo Yeon-seo, how far are you going?

201
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,970
Why did you bring me here all of a sudden?

202
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,555
To prove everything about you

203
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,849
and this universe is
from the novel that I wrote.

204
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,226
But how?

205
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,145
So if you write, "sunrise" on the beach,

206
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,689
are we going to see the sun rise
on the horizon again?

207
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,317
If that were possible,
I would've written "escape."

208
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,820
The thing is,
the final scene in this episode…

209
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,034
is one where

210
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:51,122
I'm locked up in the freezer room
at the office cafeteria tonight.

211
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,418
In exactly one minute.

212
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,547
It took us an hour and a half to get here.

213
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,215
How can we get back in one minute--

214
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,383
That's why we came here.

215
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,760
Because it's impossible
to go back within a minute.

216
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,055
In my novel, the only person
who can save Seo Yeon-seo

217
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,015
is Kang Ha-jun.

218
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,060
Only you can save me
from being locked up in the freezer room.

219
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,603
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

220
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,023
Ha-jun, please believe me.

221
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,068
If you don't come,
I'll freeze to death in the freezer room.

222
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,410
That will never happen.

223
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,630
THE DOOR OF THE FREEZER ROOM
SUDDENLY BROKE

224
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,092
JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT WORK…

225
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,144
We don't have much time.

226
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,355
Please believe me
and just come and save me, okay?

227
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,608
I really hate the cold.

228
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,234
Ha-jun, can you lend me this?

229
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,277
Are you cold?

230
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,821
-Hold on.
-Hurry up!

231
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,078
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

232
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,458
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

233
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,836
Miss Seo Yeon-seo!

234
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,734
Well, here I am.

235
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,446
The door's broken, Yeon-seo.

236
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,949
You don't have reception, Yeon-seo.

237
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,118
Hello?

238
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,871
Hello!

239
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,331
Is anybody there?

240
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,625
No one's there, Yeon-seo.

241
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,876
Hello!

242
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,379
I'm sorry, Yeon-seo.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,755
Hello?

244
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,104
I'm… Seo Yeon-seo?

245
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,523
Bok Gyu-hyun, the hater, is Kang Ha-jun

246
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,566
and my Yeo Ha-jun is Kim Do-gyeom.

247
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,110
This is hell for me.

248
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,737
You feeling like you
can't live without Yeon-seo

249
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,031
is a part of my novel,
into which I poured my heart.

250
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,408
Please believe me.

251
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,077
If you don't come,
I'll freeze to death in the freezer room.

252
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:39,207
If I believe her, that means my feelings
for Miss Seo Yeon-seo aren't real.

253
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,500
If I don't,

254
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,211
Miss Seo Yeon-seo will die.

255
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,504
What is this…

256
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,113
What's wrong with this?

257
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,198
Is it broken?

258
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,035
Hello!

259
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,081
Hello?

260
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,459
I'm trapped in here.

261
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,461
I'm trapped in here!

262
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,423
Why would someone go in there?

263
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:37,974
Only Kang Ha-jun can open that door.

264
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,814
Come out!

265
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,400
Come out, Nam Ja-yeon!

266
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,320
Come out!

267
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,167
What the hell? Hey, Nam Ja-yeon!

268
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,669
Where are you?

269
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,880
Come out, damn it!

270
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,632
Come out here,

271
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,218
Nam Ja-yeon!

272
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,306
Kang Ha-jun.

273
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,226
Come quickly.

274
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,173
-Hello, Mr. Kang.
-Good evening, sir.

275
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,642
In my novel, the only person
who can save Seo Yeon-seo is Kang Ha-jun.

276
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,855
Only you can save me
from being locked up in the freezer room.

277
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,634
He's here.

278
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,312
-How did he open it by just touching it?
-It opens that easily?

279
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,272
We tried so hard to open it.

280
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,544
I'm sorry I'm late.

281
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,801
This is…

282
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,224
an immutable law for romance novels.

283
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:31,981
The female lead always ends up
falling for the male lead.

284
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,114
I wrote it,
so why is my heart beating so fast?

285
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,996
HA-JUN, MORE FURIOUS THAN EVER,
ONLY HAD ONE THOUGHT IN MIND

286
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,917
I SHALL ENSURE YOU MEET
THE MOST MISERABLE END

287
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,840
Do you know how scared I was
because I thought you weren't coming?

288
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,009
Yeon-seo would never die
due to plot armor,

289
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,096
but me possessing her
was never a part of the plot either.

290
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,223
I was worried
there might be a further deviation.

291
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:10,770
Seo Yeon-seo… No.
Should I call you "Author" now?

292
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,565
Mr. Kang Ha-jun, do you believe me now?

293
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,068
Are you satisfied? Because I believe you?

294
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,279
Of course! You know how frustrated I was?

295
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,741
I've no idea how to get out of this world,
and no one believes me.

296
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,201
I'm glad.

297
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,209
Ha-jun, why do you look so unhappy?

298
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,212
You looked cool
when you saved Yeon-seo just now.

299
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,256
How can I not be unhappy?

300
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,343
My feelings, the universe I live in…
I mean, I'm not even real.

301
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,847
Well, I didn't mean…

302
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,473
Get some rest.

303
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,600
Mr. Kang Ha-jun, wake up.

304
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,228
Close the curtains.

305
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,856
Get up. Hurry.

306
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,024
Why?

307
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,903
Does today's episode
start early in the morning?

308
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,696
Get up if you want to know.

309
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:50,995
Isn't this the place?

310
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,706
Where you ate
the sausage you had as a child.

311
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,083
The taste you still can't forget.

312
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,834
WE COOK WITH LOVE
YEON-JUN'S MEAL

313
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,086
How did you know…

314
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,922
Is this also a part of your plot?

315
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:10,056
You don't have to prove anything anymore.
I have no choice but to believe you now.

316
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,058
It's not that.

317
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,438
Shall we go in first?

318
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,031
So this is what it looks like here.

319
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,493
Is this not a part of the story
in your novel?

320
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,412
I only imagined it as I wrote it.
It's my first time seeing it.

321
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,459
The backyard…

322
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:40,920
It's over there!

323
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,260
What are you looking for?

324
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,637
This isn't it either.

325
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,972
Step aside.

326
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,986
-I found it.
-What is it?

327
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,821
It's a secret.

328
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,270
Well, you wrote me as an empiricist,

329
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,523
so I need to taste it to know
whether I ate poop or fermented soy.

330
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,652
It's soy sauce.

331
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,996
Could this be…

332
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,709
The recipe of the sausages
you tormented Seo Yeon-seo to find.

333
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,546
Stir-fried soy sauce
sausage and vegetables.

334
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,258
Eat up before it gets cold.

335
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,062
Is it good?

336
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:29,320
Actually, Seo Yeon-seo's grandma
ran this restaurant.

337
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:35,618
The kick to the sausages that you missed
was her grandmother's aged soy sauce.

338
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,205
When I was young…

339
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,999
And I mean when I was very young…

340
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,962
my mom made this for me.

341
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,675
It's an unforgettable taste in my memory.

342
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,929
So none of this is fake.

343
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,306
It's a part of me.

344
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:02,270
Both you and this universe.

345
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,480
All of this.

346
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,902
What about Miss Seo Yeon-seo?

347
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,864
What I'm so sad and upset about the most…

348
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:19,328
is that my feelings for Miss Seo Yeon-seo
have no place to go.

349
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,208
I still love the woman in front of me,

350
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,170
but this woman says she isn't Seo Yeon-seo

351
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,381
and wishes to escape this universe.

352
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,091
So…

353
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,304
I am sad and upset.

354
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,973
I told you.

355
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,224
It's all a part of me.

356
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,894
Seo Yeon-seo is part of me too.

357
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,899
Seo Yeon-seo is me, and I'm Seo Yeon-seo.

358
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,403
This is my universe.

359
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:17,303
Is there something you want to do
in the universe you made?

360
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,681
There is.

361
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:43,287
From here to there,
give me everything in between.

362
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,622
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,791
I'm paying for all of that.

364
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,504
Mr. Kang Ha-jun, shall we go eat now?

365
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,297
What do you want to eat?

366
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,895
Enjoy your meal, Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

367
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,949
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

368
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,368
You up for dessert?

369
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,142
Mr. Kang Ha-jun. You're tired, aren't you?

370
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,285
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

371
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,454
You want more?

372
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,900
It's starting.

373
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,621
Wait.

374
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,788
What is it?

375
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:54,084
Doesn't that actor look like me?

376
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,548
All the actors
in this universe look like you.

377
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,385
Because you're the most handsome man
in this universe.

378
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,346
Oh, darn.

379
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,306
I wish I were unique.

380
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,200
Is there anything else you wanted to do?

381
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,618
I am doing it now.

382
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,786
Exactly this.

383
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:33,624
I'll do this with you
anytime and anywhere forever.

384
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,751
Ja-yeon!

385
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,713
Ja-yeon, it's Dad.

386
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:49,932
Yeon-seo.

387
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,267
Dad!

388
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,817
What took you so long?
I almost starved to death.

389
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,237
What do you want to eat, Ja-yeon?
I'll buy you anything you want.

390
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:04,905
Then I want malatang.

391
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,783
I think your stomach will be upset
because it's so spicy.

392
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,867
Then tanghulu.

393
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:09,952
Tanghulu?

394
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,955
You'll get cavities
because it's too sweet.

395
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,375
Let's go.

396
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,961
I'll buy you everything except those.

397
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,714
Then I'll raid a convenience store.

398
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,383
Okay, I'll stand guard.

399
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,095
This place is truly…

400
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,390
the universe I had dreamed of.

401
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,740
It will stay that way forever.

402
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,545
What? This sound…

403
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,298
What's this sound?

404
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,927
Mr. Kang Ha-jun, you hear this too?

405
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,512
Yes, clearly.

406
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,099
That's not good.

407
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,850
YEON-SEO'S DRESS SLIPS DOWN…

408
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,185
AND YEON-SEO'S SLIM BODY…

409
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,038
What is this?

410
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,416
This is…

411
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:26,338
this episode's critical scene
that has to happen, no matter what.

412
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,340
A scene?

413
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,265
Do you mean a scene
where our hearts grow warm

414
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:42,187
and our bodies get heated
from an intimate… conversation?

415
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,858
When this music plays,
I don't get to choose what my body does,

416
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,025
and I can't speak…

417
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,237
Never mind.

418
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,116
How come I can control my actions?

419
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,660
Is that important right now?

420
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,246
Don't think about anything else.

421
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,213
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

422
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,967
Last night, did we--

423
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,093
Did we do it?

424
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,763
Do you not remember either?

425
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,184
What on earth happened?

426
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,269
It definitely was a critical scene.

427
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,897
-Were we too tired?
-Well, I have a meeting to attend.

428
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,192
-Again.
-What?

429
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,903
Peep show.

430
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,620
You don't remember, do you?

431
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,746
Not at all.

432
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,332
But I need to go to the meeting.

433
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,958
Again.

434
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,168
What?

435
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,213
Peep show.

436
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:58,347
It's so strange, as if both the scenes
and our memories have been edited out.

437
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,015
Ms. Yeon.

438
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,811
So many readers are complaining because
they can't read Spice Up Our Love.

439
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,023
The office wants to release
a censored version.

440
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:09,983
So like 15 plus?

441
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,902
Fifteen plus?

442
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,237
Fifteen plus?

443
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,948
Why am I living in the 15 plus version?

444
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:23,121
I worked so hard
writing those passionate scenes.

445
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,291
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

446
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,043
Again.

447
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,966
I really want to,
but I really have to go to work today.

448
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,052
Is work important right now?

449
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,263
We might not have these scenes anymore.

450
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,729
Yeon-seo.

451
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,649
I don't need a scene
as long as I have you.

452
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,693
Really?

453
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,361
You're in front of me right now.

454
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,779
This is enough for me.

455
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,749
This is so annoying!

456
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,504
I'll come home early today.

457
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,340
Let me know if you want to eat anything.
My secretary will…

458
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,678
I'm sure you already know,

459
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,848
but it was Kim Do-gyeom
who locked you up in the freezer room.

460
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,726
Even if you intended it,
I couldn't let it slide.

461
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,020
This scene.

462
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,479
So I fired Mr. Kim.

463
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,693
What is it?
Is something else going to happen?

464
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,069
If you tell me first…

465
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,279
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

466
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,073
Yes, Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

467
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,078
We'll wake up together every morning

468
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,789
and sleep happily together every night.

469
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,627
Nothing will happen to us.

470
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,462
Let's live for today

471
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,923
as if we'll never die.

472
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,054
You know the main character
never dies, right?

473
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,393
I'll be home early.

474
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:51,478
I'll be fine, so don't be too sad. Okay?

475
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,244
Ha-jun.

476
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:53,957
Ha-jun.

477
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,792
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

478
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,961
Ha-jun!

479
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,599
KANG ** JUN, NEUROSURGERY

480
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,184
Something's wrong.

481
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,188
Do-gyeom's car was supposed to hit me.

482
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,982
Why did Ha-jun…

483
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,987
Ha-jun…

484
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,989
Is Mr. Kang Ha-jun okay?

485
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,283
Thankfully, he isn't badly injured.
He'll be fine.

486
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,745
Mr. Kang is a lead character.

487
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:35,248
What? What did you just say?

488
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,501
He's so perfect without any flaws.

489
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,086
Like a lead character.

490
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,718
I never thought something like this
would happen in his life.

491
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,554
Was a variable affected?

492
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,848
A variable?

493
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,850
When a change occurs
in a certain variable,

494
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,061
its corresponding value changes too.

495
00:39:56,144 --> 00:40:00,607
Now, there's no way to know
how the corresponding values will change.

496
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,405
Director Oh.

497
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,908
Then what should I do?

498
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,971
Was a variable affected
in Mr. Kang's life?

499
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,769
Now, there's no way to know
how the corresponding values will change.

500
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,652
I'm sorry, Ha-jun.

501
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,873
Mr. Kang was transferred
to an inpatient room just now.

502
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,390
Mr. Kang Ha-jun.

503
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:19,895
Miss Seo Yeon-seo.

504
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,777
I was worried.

505
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,779
A patient shouldn't be walking around--

506
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:30,947
I'm okay.

507
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,201
You said a lead character never dies.

508
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,410
Exactly.

509
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,371
You knew that. Why did you risk your life?

510
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,040
I can't die.

511
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,210
According to the plot,
I should've been hit by the car, then--

512
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,961
I couldn't let that happen.

513
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,672
And I won't be able to in the future.

514
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:56,389
Do you know what you mean to me?

515
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,730
What do I mean to you?

516
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,569
You're the reason I exist.

517
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,574
You're the reason I want to exist.

518
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,577
You're…

519
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,288
the woman I love.

520
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,257
I love you, Ms. Nam Ja-yeon.

521
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,970
Wherever and whenever,

522
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:40,892
I will always be with you, Ja-yeon.

523
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,364
That was my first kiss.

524
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,368
That wasn't your first kiss.

525
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,745
It's not a kiss I wrote,
but one that happened.

526
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,373
You can't call that a kiss.

527
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,210
Ms. Nam Ja-yeon, here's a kiss.

528
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,153
You're in front of me right now.

529
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,699
This is enough for me.

530
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,954
The universe I live in…
I mean, I'm not even real.

531
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:45,373
None of this is fake.

532
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,542
It's a part of me.

533
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,756
Both you and this universe.

534
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,134
This is my universe.

535
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:01,014
We'll wake up together every morning

536
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,017
and sleep happily together every night.

537
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,564
I love you, Ms. Nam Ja-yeon.

538
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,151
Wherever and whenever,

539
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:18,031
I will always be with you, Ja-yeon.

540
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,075
No!

541
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,451
I won't get sick of it.

542
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,539
Whether it's the flavors I love
or the women I fall for…

543
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,544
I never get bored.

544
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,671
Never.

545
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,550
You're really the CEO of GB Electric.

546
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,219
I'm Kang Ha-jun.

547
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,081
My phone.

548
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,253
Ms. Yeon.

549
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,673
It's me, the hater.

550
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,717
You're not dead?

551
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,387
I'm sorry.

552
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,932
I'm still alive,
even though you told me to die.

553
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,103
I am…

554
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,147
so glad.

555
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,445
I am glad.

556
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,770
THERE IS A POST-CREDIT SCENE

557
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,532

558
