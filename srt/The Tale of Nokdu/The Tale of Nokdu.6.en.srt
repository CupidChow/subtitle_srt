5
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,284
My lord, this is a misunderstanding.

6
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,410
Come out.

7
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,161
Well, this is...

8
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,247
Come out of the room this instant!

9
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,623
That felt so good!

10
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,166
It felt so nice to wash our hair.
It has been too long!

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,294
- How refreshing!
- Hey. Oh, no.

12
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,132
That was good, right?

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,930
Lady Kim.

14
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,309
Yes. Well,

15
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,769
I was just preparing myself
to go to bed.

16
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,313
- Come out for a second.
- Has he gone mad?

17
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,522
We have something to give you.

18
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,065
- Be quiet.
- Gosh, we live in the same house.

19
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,525
- Does he have a death...
- We do not have to ask her that.

20
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,110
We can just go in.

21
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,945
All right. Let us go in.

22
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,947
- Lady Kim, we are coming in.
- My gosh...

23
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,118
No. I will come out.

24
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,870
I am coming out now.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,710
(Episode 11)

26
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,837
Is Dong Joo home?

27
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,672
She has been out the whole day.

28
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,883
She is back. She is sleeping now.

29
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,593
We left some irides for you.

30
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,970
You two should make up tomorrow...

31
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,057
while helping each other
wash your hair.

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,350
Okay, I will.

33
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,726
Men mean nothing.

34
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,646
It is all useless, Lady Kim.

35
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,314
Gosh, my apologies.

36
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,192
You must be exhausted.
You should go and get some sleep.

37
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,444
No. We are totally fine.

38
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,488
No, hurry.
You should go and get some sleep.

39
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,198
- No, we are fine.
- My goodness.

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,533
Dong Joo is sleeping.

41
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,368
Wait. But...

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,093
So that is why you help him
hide the fact that he is a man?

43
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,386
Yes.

44
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:01,014
As he will leave soon,
do not tell anyone about this.

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,432
Please.

46
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,893
Then, what about...

47
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,275
- What I just saw...
- That was an accident.

48
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,860
He slipped.

49
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,486
Do you expect me to believe that?

50
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,029
I trust you, but that jerk...

51
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,281
That was not an accident.

52
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,657
Be quiet.

53
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,910
I can understand that you may think
he is reckless, foolish.

54
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,287
and shameless,

55
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,705
- Hey.
- However,

56
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,499
he is not evil,
so please do not worry.

57
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,544
Are you looking out for him now?

58
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,381
If people find out he is a man,

59
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,717
I will also be punished
for helping him.

60
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,802
I am looking out for myself.

61
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,014
So please pretend
you saw nothing, and leave.

62
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,640
If you stay here longer,
it will be dangerous.

63
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,019
I hate you.

64
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,731
You know that I could never go
against your wish.

65
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,530
- Come with me.
- What are you doing?

66
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,533
Were you going to spend the night
with Dong Joo again?

67
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,077
We will sort it out ourselves.

68
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,746
Please stop.

69
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,457
I will sleep in a room
at the gisaeng house.

70
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,417
- Please.
- Goodness.

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,711
Put this on.

72
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,463
Hurry.

73
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:36,026
(The Tale of Nokdu)

74
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,242
So there is no lady...

75
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,952
he has feelings for?

76
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,758
Whatever.

77
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,850
Turn off the candle if you want us
to get any sleep here.

78
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,968
You startled me.

79
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,064
- Well...
- If you mention the kiss,

80
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,232
I will kill you.

81
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,484
- Which one...
- Stop asking me...

82
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,819
which one of you I like.

83
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,739
- Cough...
- Stop talking about coughing.

84
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,532
You keep talking about nonsense
I do not understand.

85
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,659
Just hear me out.

86
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,828
Hey, why are you not asking me?

87
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,580
I do not have a lady.

88
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,498
I lied. The lady I met in Hanyang...

89
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,583
Forget it.

90
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,001
I do not want to know.

91
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,880
Why not?
Why do you not want to know?

92
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,591
Unlike your assumption,

93
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,093
I am not interested in you.

94
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,262
Do not...

95
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,472
Do not lie.

96
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,681
I am not lying.

97
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,309
Hey.

98
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,854
Are you angry because I kissed you
without asking...

99
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,606
- your permission?
- No.

100
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,984
That is not a big deal.
One kiss will not wear down my lips.

101
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,446
How could you say that?

102
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,573
I definitely felt it.

103
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,367
- You felt the same way...
- You have...

104
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,202
never dated a woman, right?

105
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,954
Not once in your life.

106
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
What?

107
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,876
No. That is not true.

108
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,294
It was just not a couple of women...

109
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,629
who fell in love with me
in my hometown.

110
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,630
Who do you think I am?

111
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,258
I bet it was
just not a couple of women.

112
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,219
- You probably had none.
- Why you little...

113
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,305
That is why you are mistaken
and are chasing the wrong person.

114
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,807
I am mistaken?

115
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,226
- I am chasing the wrong person?
- Yes.

116
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,187
Do not be clingy anymore
if you understood how I feel.

117
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,858
I came here to tell you this.

118
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,530
"Clingy"?

119
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,431
I am begging you!

120
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,726
Please let me see my mother.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,020
I must see her.

122
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,064
If I go out that door,

123
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,525
I will never be able
to see her again.

124
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,236
Please let me see her.

125
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,573
Mother!

126
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,785
Mother.

127
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,954
- Mother.
- Your Highness.

128
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,248
Your Highness.

129
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,171
Your Highness.

130
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,306
Did he cry a lot?

131
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,769
He was brave after leaving the gate.

132
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,399
The wailing for my poor brother
was so loud...

133
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,027
that you could almost hear it
past the wall of the palace.

134
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,907
I wonder if they acted that way...

135
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,492
when I was humiliated in the past.

136
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,204
I was like that, Your Majesty.

137
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,834
Yes, you were the only one.

138
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,547
Even my father refused
to acknowledge me.

139
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,091
That is why he left...

140
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,969
such a cruel dying wish.

141
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,975
Had you not gotten rid of it
soon enough,

142
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,147
perhaps, I would
not have become the King.

143
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,234
That is why...

144
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,237
I trust you.

145
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,949
I trust only you.

146
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,746
Do you know that, Yun?

147
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,832
I am...

148
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,419
truly grateful, Your Majesty.

149
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,016
Is this the secret dying wish
of the late king?

150
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,060
The rumors were true.

151
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,440
Why did you not
make your move sooner?

152
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:10,235
His Majesty suddenly became
the King,

153
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,696
and Prince Yeongchang
is still young.

154
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,908
I was looking for the right timing.

155
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,870
However, you were quicker.

156
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,332
You will be punished
for this conspiracy.

157
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:27,419
I promise that one day...

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,923
you will regret
taking the royal order from me.

159
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,128
You.

160
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,714
The boy is His Majesty's son.

161
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,926
He is growing up
as a bright and smart man.

162
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,595
Since His Majesty
has become the King,

163
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,391
he should return, should he not?

164
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,684
I cannot do that.

165
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,060
Why not?

166
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,521
Since he is in the highest position,

167
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,566
there is nothing for him to fear.

168
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,121
(Dethrone the Crown Prince...)

169
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,499
(and let Prince Yeongchang
take the throne after me.)

170
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,545
What is this?

171
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,424
I just came back
from killing the man who hid that.

172
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,135
What do you think?

173
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,971
Do you truly think he has nothing
to worry about anymore?

174
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,849
How could this be?

175
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,978
We do not know why
the late king made the decision.

176
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,897
What if this will not end...

177
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,232
by his accession to the throne?

178
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,737
I, you, and that boy...

179
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,365
may all die.

180
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,580
So give up on your pipe dream
and go home.

181
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,082
If you appear before me again,

182
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,086
I will not be able to show mercy.

183
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,067
My lord.

184
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,737
Yun Jeo has disappeared?

185
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,614
The Muweol Corps women who were
keeping their eyes on him have died.

186
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,491
You must find him no matter what.

187
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,413
Did you bring the bodies
of the Muweol Corps women?

188
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,414
No, my lord.

189
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,459
The body in the room was found
at the village for widows.

190
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,550
She was tortured.

191
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,802
I believe the man who sneaked
into the village for widows...

192
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,471
killed her and fled to Hanyang.

193
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,766
If she spilled anything...

194
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,811
Find the boy...

195
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,521
and get the Muweol Corps ready.

196
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,192
I think we should get rid
of the local functionary...

197
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,820
and bring in Prince Yeongchang.

198
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,907
Yes, my lord.

199
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,555
You found the boss?

200
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,018
I am halfway there.

201
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,021
That does not matter.
Just kill the boss.

202
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,690
No, it is more complicated
than it seems.

203
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,817
She talked about the island,
so it must be her.

204
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,943
Okay.

205
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,573
But I believe someone else
is involved in it.

206
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,825
And who is that?

207
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,577
Kill that person too.

208
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,623
- The King.
- What?

209
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,084
The King?

210
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,671
Are you talking about His Majesty?

211
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,840
- Yes.
- Hey!

212
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,594
I do understand
how hard it must be...

213
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,930
to be dressed like that here.

214
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,975
But saying that...

215
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,103
hurts me.

216
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,272
I know
that it does not make any sense.

217
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,358
But...

218
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,695
if my father truly
does know the King...

219
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,365
If he is an aristocrat...

220
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,618
If he is hiding on the island
due to a crime he has committed,

221
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,371
then perhaps,
I should not dig into it.

222
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,331
Crime? Conspiracy?

223
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,878
Conspiracy? My father?

224
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,297
No.

225
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,967
That cannot be true.

226
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,719
My mother...

227
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,596
definitely said...

228
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,431
that it was because of me.

229
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,433
No. It must be a misunderstanding.

230
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,561
Your father is not that type.

231
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,272
He is a very righteous man.
It cannot be.

232
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,694
Anyway, I do not think
I should be rash.

233
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,195
I need to investigate further.

234
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,865
You are right.
You should be certain.

235
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,285
By the way,

236
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,162
your eyes are swollen.

237
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,083
It looks as if you cried a river
after being rejected by a woman.

238
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,669
That is not true.

239
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,712
Let me see.

240
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,631
Where is Aeng Du?
I have not seen her since yesterday.

241
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,799
Aeng Du?

242
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,220
She keeps crying and saying things
that I do not understand.

243
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,930
He is a sister.

244
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,349
He is a sister.

245
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,934
A sister.

246
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,902
He is my sister. My sister.

247
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,153
Yesterday, I...

248
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,071
That is enough.

249
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,991
Did they roll him?

250
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,993
Did they?

251
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,914
Did he die?

252
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:40,417
Then roll me too! Roll me!

253
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,628
Really?

254
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,964
All right, then. Let us go.

255
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,052
Oh, my! Father!

256
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,222
Father, I am dying! Father!

257
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,599
Father!

258
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,101
Where in the world is she?

259
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,103
I do not see her anywhere.

260
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,453
Where are you going?

261
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,332
- To work.
- Are you doing laundry?

262
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,502
I guess not.

263
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,672
The gisaeng house. I will be working
in their kitchen from today.

264
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,719
Father...

265
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,237
Are you not rolling me
in a straw mat?

266
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,031
If you die, who will eat my food?

267
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,827
Then where is...

268
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,996
my sister?

269
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,039
Since there are two females
who want to protect him,

270
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,666
I decided to spare his life for now.

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,042
But in return,

272
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,837
will you do me a favor?

273
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,346
First, let us fill our stomachs.

274
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,390
After that, we will talk.

275
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,785
Gosh.

276
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,163
Do not go.

277
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,332
What can you do in the kitchen?

278
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:47,169
Hey, do you not know why
he told you to come to the kitchen?

279
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,338
You are so naive.

280
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,131
He obviously wants
to separate the two of us.

281
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,550
I guess you know.

282
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,511
That is why you should not go there.

283
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,429
I need to pay back
what I owe to you.

284
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,432
I will give you a discount,
so do not go.

285
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,311
My gosh, I told you
not to be so clingy!

286
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,535
No, I am going to keep being clingy.

287
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,704
- What?
- You told me you do not like me.

288
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,123
Okay, I get that.

289
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,250
But you see,

290
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,710
I am going to make you like me.

291
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,132
So do not go to him.

292
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,768
How are you going to do that?

293
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,311
Well...

294
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,449
My gosh, hey!

295
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,759
Will you please stop?

296
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,678
You are making me feel
very uncomfortable.

297
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,762
Hurry up and leave.

298
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,306
Go on.

299
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,238
I will do as you asked...

300
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,491
and act like I do not know anything
for your sake.

301
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,870
Let us say I forget about
what happened yesterday.

302
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,914
But you cannot keep sleeping
in the same room...

303
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,083
What kind of person
do you think I am?

304
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,170
We are also living with
that little girl, so do not worry.

305
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,963
Nothing will happen.

306
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,549
Okay, fine.

307
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,556
But I have a question.

308
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,268
You said you like someone.

309
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,355
I clearly heard you say that.

310
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,070
Tell me.

311
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,698
Was he the person you had in mind
when you said that?

312
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,837
Of course not.
I have standards too, you know.

313
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,005
Yes, of course. Right?

314
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,424
There is no way
you would like a guy like him.

315
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,432
Then...

316
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,648
were you talking about me?

317
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,108
No.

318
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,610
I just got drunk
and said something I did not mean.

319
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,074
You did not...

320
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,077
have to deny it so strongly.

321
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,338
That darn little jerk.

322
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,798
I might as well just...

323
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,176
What are you doing, sister?

324
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,094
Gosh, you startled me.

325
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,098
Did you just badmouth
my dear Yul Mu?

326
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,183
What?

327
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,187
"My dear Yul Mu"?

328
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,023
One thing led to another,
and it just happened.

329
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,650
I really could not help it.

330
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:42,237
Aeng Du, what are you talking about?

331
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,489
I thought about it,

332
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,991
and when you get married,

333
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,994
you have to be together
for the rest of your life.

334
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,955
And I came to a conclusion...

335
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,125
that he is much better than you.

336
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,752
Forgive me.

337
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,587
Aeng Du.

338
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,381
He is well-built...

339
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,383
and warm-hearted.

340
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,720
He always smiles at me.

341
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,097
Dong Joo told me
that I should find a great guy,

342
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,266
and I think he is the one.

343
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,477
He is the one without a doubt.

344
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,354
My gosh.

345
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,530
My goodness, this is great.

346
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,865
My gosh.

347
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,618
Oh, gosh. Here you go.

348
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,956
- My gosh, it tastes sweet.
- Let me pour you one more cup.

349
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,128
So are you telling me...

350
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,924
that you are practically
Lady Kim's father?

351
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,259
Yes, of course.

352
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:49,179
I practically raised that kid.

353
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,015
My goodness, my father-in-law.

354
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,976
Will you please help me out?

355
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,646
I am willing to do anything...

356
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,439
to win her heart.

357
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,484
Oh, really?

358
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,610
Let me go first.

359
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,282
I am a professional when it comes
to winning women's hearts.

360
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,659
But of course,

361
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,663
my knowledge only applies to women.

362
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:16,874
Anyway,

363
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,044
I will tell you what you need to do
to win a woman's heart.

364
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,045
What is it?

365
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,463
- What is it?
- What is it?

366
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,590
My goodness.

367
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,759
My gosh, this is embarrassing.

368
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:46,445
You need to be indifferent and kind
at the same time.

369
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,821
This is the secret.

370
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,198
Let me tell you what that means.

371
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,991
This is what you should say
before you help her do something.

372
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,159
"Is this the best you can do?"

373
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,286
"You should just go kill yourself
for not being able to do this!"

374
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:59,458
And then, help her out
as if you are just doing it...

375
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,752
because you have no choice.

376
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:13,263
My gosh, you startled me.

377
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,892
Just go kill yourself.
You are so bad at this.

378
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,060
What?

379
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,114
My gosh, what are you doing?
Give it to me.

380
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,783
Give it to me. I will do it.

381
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,076
My gosh.

382
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,163
I am helping you because I have to.

383
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:45,963
My gosh.

384
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,215
- Hey!
- Who taught you this?

385
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,675
What are you talking about?

386
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,385
You will remember this
before you go to bed.

387
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,761
I am being indifferent yet kind.

388
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,137
It is very addictive.

389
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,531
Why are you looking at me like that
if you do not like me?

390
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,076
What are you talking about?

391
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,120
How did I look at you?

392
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,632
Like this.

393
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:40,726
Where are you going?

394
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,061
It is none of your business.

395
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,566
Do not be late. Eat dinner at home.

396
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,650
Okay?

397
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,069
Did you hear me?

398
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,741
My gosh, she never listens
to her mother.

399
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,787
You want to use...

400
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,247
the assistant captain
of Ganghwa Island?

401
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,083
Do you think that will be okay?

402
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,712
There are a lot of people
who care for Prince Yeongchang.

403
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,924
We will do our best not to give them
any excuses.

404
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,092
So do not worry, Your Majesty.

405
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,096
On top of that, it will be better
if they willingly...

406
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,598
cause a fuss on their own.

407
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,770
This will be a chance for me
to find out...

408
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,564
who could end up betraying me.

409
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,594
Lee In Woo, the local functionary.

410
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,930
He is the one who planned the exile.

411
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,850
His father will be celebrating
his 60th birthday tomorrow.

412
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,019
I heard they only invited
their family members.

413
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,272
I guess he is worried
that an assassin might kill him...

414
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,815
if he invites a lot of people.

415
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,066
He will never know...

416
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,610
that the women who work there
will be the assassins.

417
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,530
Seven of us will go to Hanyang
including me and Jung Sook.

418
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,198
Once we take care of this,

419
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,827
I will check if anyone has
heard anything about Deul Le.

420
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,289
Okay, I will go to Ganghwa Island
with the others.

421
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,166
Please relay this to everyone
that will be departing with us.

422
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,626
Okay.

423
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:35,007
Gosh, everyone in the Muweol Corps
will be gone.

424
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,509
Aeng Du thinks he is better than me?

425
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,469
Cha Yul Mu, that punk.

426
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,221
I cannot believe Aeng Du chose him
over me because of the food.

427
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,230
I guess you are traveling far.

428
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,525
Yes, we are going to Hanyang.

429
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,528
There is
this huge 60th birthday party.

430
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,948
We plan to raise a ruckus there.

431
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:02,910
Hanyang...

432
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:03,994
I can go and help.

433
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,163
No. This is important and dangerous.

434
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,207
It is quite a mess in Hanyang now.

435
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,667
Do you know what His Majesty did?
In Ganghwa Island...

436
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,253
Stop it. You are sharing too much.

437
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,131
What did His Majesty do?

438
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,801
That is none of your business.

439
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,096
Do not cause trouble.

440
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:31,772
Bye.

441
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,777
Ganghwa Island? His Majesty?

442
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,910
I have been informed
that the Muweol Corps has departed.

443
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,412
Are you sure everything is ready?

444
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:48,539
Yes.

445
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,791
The local functionary's house
will be crowded for the party,

446
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,960
so they will not have difficulty
blending in.

447
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,337
I see.

448
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,112
I guess you are plotting
something again.

449
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,788
It has been a while.

450
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:31,999
You...

451
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,680
Your Majesty,
I was not expecting the honor.

452
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,559
I told you to call me Lord
when I am out.

453
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,978
Is he inside?

454
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,480
Yes. He is resting.

455
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:56,565
Is that so?

456
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:58,859
In that case,

457
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,529
let me surprise him tonight.

458
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,494
What did you do to my sons?

459
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,496
That is what I would like
to ask you.

460
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,498
Your son...

461
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:14,875
No.

462
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,169
Where is the King's son?

463
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,670
Why are you doing this now?

464
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:19,713
We lived in hiding...

465
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,548
as if we did not exist
just like you told me to.

466
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,555
If you did, you should have
made sure I never found you.

467
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,437
- My lord.
- I thought he was alone.

468
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,283
Your Majesty.

469
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,693
How about a round of janggi?
It has been a while.

470
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,365
As you wish, Your Majesty.

471
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,467
All the entrances have been blocked.

472
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,219
Follow me.

473
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:04,735
Mother.

474
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,627
I have finished.

475
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,922
Now, I can leave.

476
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,092
Yes. I must leave.

477
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:32,596
I was going to leave
after I finished making this.

478
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,143
The food is getting cold.

479
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,686
What is taking her so long?

480
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,689
Do you think she would be
interested in this meal?

481
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,024
What do you mean?

482
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:47,861
My dear Yul Mu cooks her
all kinds of dishes.

483
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,321
Just today,

484
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,616
he made jeolpyeon and maejakgwa.

485
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,368
Did I not tell you?

486
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,827
I am just saying...

487
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:00,541
that his meals are much better
than yours if she has to choose.

488
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,794
That jerk. I should just...

489
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:19,601
You are not going to eat?

490
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,353
I already ate.

491
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:31,196
It is your loss.

492
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,168
What do you think about...

493
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,086
when you make these snacks
in the kitchen?

494
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,212
Usually,

495
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,590
I do not think about anything,

496
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,509
but I was very happy to make these.

497
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:54,845
Why is that?

498
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:59,016
I made them with a woman I like.

499
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,394
Is she a gisaeng?

500
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,482
Yes.

501
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,234
She is a gisaeng, Your Majesty.

502
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,658
You have time and freedom.

503
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,370
I am quite envious of your life.

504
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,040
Please do not covet my life...

505
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:25,542
because I like my life
very much too.

506
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,433
Did you see anyone suspicious?

507
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:44,520
I thoroughly searched the place,

508
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,063
but we did not find
anyone suspicious.

509
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,814
Do not lower your guard to the end.

510
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,193
And make sure you thoroughly inspect
all the men who come into the house.

511
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:52,444
I will.

512
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,400
I will go first.

513
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:32,526
Borrow a horse
from the gisaeng house...

514
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:33,902
and follow me.

515
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,529
Yes, my lord.

516
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,384
All right.

517
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:01,305
Is this the famous Yeonhwa House?

518
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,765
Yes, it is. You have come
to the right place.

519
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,225
Is this your first time?

520
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,435
Yes.

521
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,438
I am an assistant captain
of Ganghwa Island.

522
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,523
I was on my way to celebrate
an occasion in Hanyang.

523
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,609
And people told me
I should visit this place,

524
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,819
- Ganghwa Island?
- so I am here.

525
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,363
We are honored to have you.
Please follow me this way.

526
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:19,573
- Okay.
- This way.

527
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,533
All right.

528
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,369
Where is the gisaeng named Hwa Su?

529
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,005
Yes.

530
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,217
The King's little brother
whom he had banished...

531
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:41,762
came to my region, Ganghwa Island.

532
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,056
His Majesty is so brutal.

533
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,100
Do not think like that.

534
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,561
Thanks to that,

535
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,607
I was promoted.

536
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,400
How is
the King's brother's exile...

537
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,444
and your promotion related?

538
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:58,946
Listen.

539
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,073
There is a feast in Hanyang and...

540
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:07,246
Never mind.

541
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:12,835
Just know that it is good news.

542
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:15,295
What was that?

543
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,469
Goodness.

544
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,100
Goodness, I am drunk.

545
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:48,871
Are you going to become a merchant?

546
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,873
It will not be easy to sell items...

547
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,416
to the court ladies
since many merchants...

548
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,126
have been doing that
for a long time.

549
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,502
No, master.

550
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,339
Someone else was interested,
so that is why I asked you.

551
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,471
Goodness.

552
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:15,480
Goodness, that was nice.

553
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:20,819
Who are you?

554
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:23,739
Could you explain to me
about that feast in Hanyang?

555
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,325
I cannot tell you.

556
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:27,534
What if your life is at stake?

557
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,077
Mother.

558
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,623
Mother?

559
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,750
Gosh!

560
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:37,544
Goodness!

561
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,546
He is a pervert! Call some people!

562
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,506
Okay.

563
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,894
Lady Chun.

564
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,354
I am an assistant captain
of Ganghwa Island.

565
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,731
This widow was trying to harm me.

566
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:00,359
She put a knife to my neck!

567
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,861
I was just...

568
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,614
So...

569
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:15,249
Tell me in detail
about why you are going to Hanyang.

570
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:27,553
Who knew he would hire...

571
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,388
the assistant captain
of Ganghwa Island...

572
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,723
in order to kill his brother
whom he had banished?

573
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,562
Are you the boss?

574
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,397
Are you the boss of Muweol Corps?

575
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,815
We can talk about that next time.

576
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,150
We are running out of time.

577
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:43,652
If you find Sook,

578
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,821
tell her to pull everyone out...

579
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:46,822
and to go to the temple...

580
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:48,115
where the local functionary
is in hiding.

581
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,908
Tell her that we are in a trap.

582
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,411
Okay, do not worry about it.

583
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,110
It is best to do it
when it is noisy.

584
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,570
So why is it so quiet?

585
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,447
Something feels wrong.

586
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:31,033
We should pull out.

587
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:32,492
What do you mean?

588
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,161
Could it be...

589
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,353
These women are the assassins.
Get them!

590
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:35,430
Make sure to kill everyone
who saw our faces.

591
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,450
My gosh! It's so hot.

592
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,369
Lady Kim?

593
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:58,912
The boss sent me.

594
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,581
The boss? Why?

595
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:03,584
She wanted me to warn you
about what is happening now.

596
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,470
The local functionary is hiding...

597
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:16,763
at the temple in Mount Inwang.

598
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:17,848
What?

599
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:19,766
Do you think you can go?

600
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:20,893
Me?

601
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:24,354
Oh no.

602
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,487
How can I leave you here?

603
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,531
This place is too dangerous for you.

604
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,909
I will go there right away,
so buy me some time.

605
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:54,051
It is no fun
to simply just buy time.

606
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,604
Gosh.

607
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,731
You should go back.

608
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,150
This place is restricted.

609
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:12,486
If that was true,

610
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,739
you shouldn't have let
your guard down.

611
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,199
What?

612
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:32,548
Is it over?

613
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,008
I did not see anyone escape.

614
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,595
Let us hurry. Lady Kim may be
running out of time.

615
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,488
Why do you do this?

616
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:39,948
What?

617
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,409
You could live a normal life
at the village,

618
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:43,994
so why would you do something
so dangerous?

619
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,997
Is it because you need money
just like I do?

620
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:52,544
Why would we need money
when we are living alone in hiding?

621
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,421
Then why?

622
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,925
Because we are the only ones
who can live in freedom.

623
00:45:58,509 --> 00:45:59,510
What?

624
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:14,525
My in-laws did this to me...

625
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,401
for not killing myself
after my husband died.

626
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:19,780
He died three days
after we got married.

627
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:22,908
Had I not escaped then,

628
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:24,159
I may have been killed...

629
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:25,410
alongside my husband...

630
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:27,871
whose face I can no longer remember.

631
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,583
But my story is nothing compared
to some of theirs.

632
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:35,420
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

633
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,923
- You?
- I'm okay.

634
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,050
- Are you tired?
- I am.

635
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:44,471
Thanks to our boss,
we could live better lives.

636
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,765
But the situation outside
of this village hasn't changed.

637
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,851
You know that as well.

638
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:52,145
- Right.
- We were the ones...

639
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:54,606
who first decided
to help widows like you.

640
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:58,443
No one else would bother...

641
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,280
to help a widow.

642
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,157
Then, did you...

643
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,452
decide to kill the local functionary
because he harmed the widows?

644
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:10,539
No.

645
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:12,791
But...

646
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,586
we are doing this
to make this world a better place...

647
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:17,921
for people like us
who have no power.

648
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:21,508
I believe in that.

649
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,769
I made sure the local functionary
was dead...

650
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:34,646
and made it look like
he died due to a fall.

651
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,857
Good work.

652
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:38,525
Lady Kim...

653
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,155
helped us out a lot this time.

654
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,534
I guess I should keep my promise...

655
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,037
and let you join our corps.

656
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:53,582
Welcome to Muweol Corps, Lady Kim.

657
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:59,505
Jung Sook will be
waiting for you outside.

658
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:01,715
She will guide you
through the details.

659
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:05,677
Meanwhile, we have
something more to discuss.

660
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,515
Okay, I understand.

661
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:27,991
Is there a problem?

662
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:42,756
He was not a vulgar fellow.

663
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,591
He was the assistant captain
of Ganghwa Island.

664
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,510
But he was a pervert?

665
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,471
And I looked all over the place,
but I could not find him.

666
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:02,568
He did not come home?

667
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,111
No.

668
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,655
So there is nothing
I can tell you...

669
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:09,408
about what happened
between him and Dong Joo.

670
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:16,331
But why are you so sleepy?

671
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,544
My gosh, Dong Joo did not
sleep a wink last night.

672
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:23,463
She kept moving around.

673
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,550
And because of that,
I could not sleep either.

674
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:29,136
Dong Joo?

675
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,180
Yes.

676
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:33,390
She would not stop sighing.

677
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:36,351
She would open the door
and look outside.

678
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:39,479
Then she just went outside...

679
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,690
and started to say this.

680
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,484
"He is not coming home?"

681
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:46,486
"How dare he not come home
without telling me?"

682
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,263
This is where we make alcohol.

683
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:14,806
The alcohol we make
gets sent to the gisaeng house.

684
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,892
And the money they make there...

685
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,811
is spent on the safety and growth...

686
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,607
of Muweol Corps and the widows.
It is very beautiful.

687
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,502
Thank you for today.

688
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:44,670
You should go.

689
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:47,130
You should let her
stand guard tonight.

690
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,590
No, not tonight.

691
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,595
There is no need
to overwork yourself already.

692
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:54,763
You should get some rest.

693
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,557
Okay.

694
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,329
My goodness.

695
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,044
Is that you?

696
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,511
Dong Joo.

697
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:36,513
Lord Yul Mu.

698
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,602
You cannot come in here.

699
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,187
No, it is okay.

700
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,606
I am allowed to do that.

701
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,816
What?

702
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,377
We got rid of the local functionary,
but this is just the beginning.

703
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:08,837
His Majesty would have found out...

704
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,424
that there are people who are
trying to protect Prince Yeongchang.

705
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,384
Do you think you will be safe?

706
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:17,638
I asked someone to safely bring
Prince Yeongchang to this place.

707
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,598
- Then are you saying...
- Tomorrow.

708
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:23,602
We will carry out our plan tomorrow.

709
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:40,327
(Men are not allowed to enter.)

710
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,526
We already have everything ready.

711
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,529
But His Majesty is very sensitive.
Now is not the right time.

712
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:18,448
If we keep being careful,
things might all go down the drain.

713
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:19,533
What will you do then?

714
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:20,742
He is right.

715
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:22,077
A moment of chaos...

716
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,662
might actually be the best moment.

717
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:25,372
We should no longer wait.
Let us hurry...

718
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:26,915
There is no need for that.

719
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:10,876
You should never be in a hurry.

720
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,588
- What in the world...
- Oh, and one more thing.

721
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,340
I already took care...

722
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:18,550
of what was urgent.

723
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,402
If I go out that door,

724
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:39,988
I will never be able
to see her again.

725
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:42,032
Please let me see her.

726
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:44,117
Is no one outside?

727
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:45,536
There are people outside,

728
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:47,329
but they all work for me.

729
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,790
Should I ask them to come inside?

730
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:52,543
What have you done
to Prince Yeongchang?

731
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:59,007
I killed him.

732
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:15,607
Will you really...

733
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,111
keep your promise?

734
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:20,487
Of course.

735
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,739
Your job...

736
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,247
begins now.

737
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,688
Mother.

738
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:58,400
Mother.

739
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,957
How dare you do such a thing?

740
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,865
- It is me.
- Hey.

741
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:30,117
Do you know
how long I have waited...

742
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,132
Come with me.

743
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:57,519
Hey.

744
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:01,023
Why can you not look me in the eye?

745
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,525
No, I can.

746
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:05,861
Go ahead. Stay in a bright room.

747
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,654
Why are you not coming with me?

748
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:10,115
I will explain it later.

749
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,492
That customer at the gisaeng house.

750
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,786
He was not a pervert, right?

751
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:18,498
Where did you go
after you disappeared like that?

752
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,504
Why did you come...

753
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,964
to the village for widows?

754
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,094
I will also explain that later.

755
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,374
I hate noises.

756
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:02,417
Grand Prince Neungyang!

757
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:09,967
(Grand Prince Neungyang,
King Injo later on)

758
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:46,587
Let us not complicate things.

759
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,089
Do not let Prince Yeongchang...

760
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:51,425
who is young and weak
take the throne.

761
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:53,510
Instead,

762
00:59:56,471 --> 00:59:58,807
help me take the throne.

763
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:01,810
That is the only change
in your plan.

764
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:46,313
Did you think this vulgar threat
would scare me?

765
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,315
Oh, no. I would never think that.

766
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:51,068
If I am determined to make a threat,

767
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,866
I will not end it here.

768
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,660
I only came here...

769
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,829
to say hello today.

770
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:12,965
So you want to become a king?

771
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:16,635
Do you think you have
what it takes to be a king?

772
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:36,673
(The Tale of Nokdu)

773
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,885
A gisaeng house
provides for the village.

774
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,137
I want the leader...

775
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:45,891
and all the widows who are close
to the leader of the house.

776
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:47,893
If I were the son of the King,

777
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:49,603
I would not feel wronged
to be on the run...

778
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:51,480
and live in hiding
for the rest of my life.

779
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,524
So you have joined the Muweol Corps.

780
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:55,776
And you are preparing
to commit treason?

781
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:57,361
(The war...)

782
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:01,031
Tomorrow night, the Muweol Corps
must leave the village completely.

783
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:05,077
Will you be okay if I kill him?

784
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:06,995
(begins.)

785
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,542
I will not ask you to like me.

786
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,418
Please do not disappear on me.

787
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,295
I am begging you.
