00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,402
(Episode 15)

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,408
Dong Joo.

7
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,577
Stop.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,579
Stop it immediately!

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,214
Nok Du.

10
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,701
I will take Dong Joo with me.

11
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,250
These jerks...

12
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,210
seem to know you.

13
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,336
That is why...

14
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,506
it will be the safest
if I take her with me.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,217
- Of course, for Dong Joo.
- Stop talking nonsense and move...

16
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,718
unless you want to die.

17
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,137
If I do, Dong Joo will die.

18
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,515
Is that what you want?

19
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,642
What is going on?

20
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,686
What is this?

21
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,190
- What is this?
- What is happening?

22
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,987
Kill the widows.

23
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,616
But do not kill the gisaengs yet.

24
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,161
- Let us go.
- Okay.

25
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,998
Yeon Geun, let us do this!

26
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,210
Go!

27
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,294
Go.

28
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,262
Are you serious?

29
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,891
Get out of here now!

30
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,476
Go!

31
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,603
Darn it.

32
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,065
I would appreciate it if you did.

33
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,359
Darn it.

34
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,655
Throwing the rock at you
was a mistake.

35
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,797
What...

36
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,850
Come here.

37
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,486
Go!

38
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,825
You little wench!

39
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,136
Hwa Su!

40
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,390
Lady Chun...

41
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,894
Are you okay?

42
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,523
Go to the village for widows.

43
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,656
You are safe now.

44
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,720
Dong Joo.

45
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,966
I will summon a physician.

46
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,266
No!

47
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,351
Darn it!

48
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,394
Darn!

49
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,106
No!

50
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,151
I caught you.

51
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,784
What is going on? Oh, dear.

52
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,871
Something has happened here.

53
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,039
Could you take care of her?

54
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,917
You are injured. Go on, now.

55
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:39,960
He is wasted.

56
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,005
You will be hurt.
Leave them up to me.

57
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,175
No, no, no. Leave them to me.

58
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,764
This geezer is too drunk and bold.

59
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,516
- Gosh!
- Get him!

60
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,609
What?

61
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,070
Hit the head! Then here!

62
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,155
All right!

63
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,538
You can do it!

64
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,664
Darn it!

65
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,627
Look at him.

66
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,755
I feel drunker
now that I have moved.

67
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,799
Where is Nok...

68
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,011
Soon?

69
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,431
"Nok Soon"?

70
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,693
Mal Nyun, are you okay?

71
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,144
All right.

72
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:06,398
These wenches are quite brave.

73
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,483
All right.

74
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,945
Which one wants to go first?

75
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,995
I do.

76
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,040
What? Who is he?

77
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,291
He is all alone.

78
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,225
I will go first.

79
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,856
Who is this dirtbag?

80
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,307
(Brewery)

81
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,391
What is going on?

82
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,693
Are you okay?

83
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,494
Thank you for helping us.

84
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,749
- By the way...
- You look familiar.

85
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,711
Goodness.

86
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,754
Brother...

87
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,672
Sister!

88
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:39,551
Have you got caught?

89
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,763
Do they now know that
you disguised as a woman?

90
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:46,099
You have got caught? You idiot.

91
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,185
Aeng Du, that is enough.

92
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,397
Still, how could you beat him up
like that?

93
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,399
You are evil, indeed.

94
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,193
You are very cruel.

95
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,403
Goodness.

96
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,448
Come here, now.

97
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,207
You are Lady Kim.

98
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,584
Are you not?

99
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,762
What?

100
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,808
That cannot be.

101
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,477
That is impossible.

102
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,729
Wait. She was a man?

103
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,692
How could she be a man?

104
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,488
Does that mean...

105
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,450
you pretended to be a woman?

106
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,453
No way. We even bathed together.

107
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,956
Does he not look like...

108
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,001
that dirtbag who sneaked
into our village?

109
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,338
Why did you approach us...

110
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,216
while disguising yourself
as a woman?

111
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,844
Back on our island,

112
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,512
our family was attacked.

113
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,347
I had to find out...

114
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,851
who did it and why.

115
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,150
I am truly sorry about everything.

116
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,359
Nok Du!

117
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,529
Nok Du!

118
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
Let me through.

119
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,422
I am sorry.

120
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,758
This is all my fault.

121
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,636
I thought...

122
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,597
I thought you died.

123
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,807
Why would I?

124
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,935
Look at me.

125
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,811
I am fine...

126
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,192
Nok Du! Hey...

127
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,612
- Oh, no!
- Nok Du!

128
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,617
His Majesty will not be able
to find anything in the village.

129
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,285
The fire destroyed everything.

130
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,663
And the widows who survived
all went their separate ways.

131
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,624
She disappeared
while I went to get her medicine...

132
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,459
without even saying a word.

133
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,002
I apologize.

134
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,712
I should have come earlier.

135
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,964
No, it is okay.

136
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,884
I am the one who told you
that we should not be at the scene.

137
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:28,595
Dan Ho.

138
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,973
About that guy...

139
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,353
I can no longer let him stay alive.

140
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,398
I understand.
I will find him and kill him.

141
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,693
Before you do that,

142
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,822
there is one more thing
we need to take care of.

143
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,428
If you keep walking this way,

144
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,598
you can get to the pier
without getting caught.

145
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,393
Once you get there,
you must go your separate ways.

146
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,604
We have nowhere to go.

147
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,148
The bandits are all dead.

148
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,442
And we can always
build a new village.

149
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,985
So please do not tell us to leave.

150
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,279
You must go...

151
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,864
as far away as you can.

152
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,618
We will escort the widows there.

153
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,042
I wanted to help you
live in a world...

154
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,836
where you did not have to hide...

155
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,090
and you did not have to be scared
just because you are women.

156
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,969
I am sorry...

157
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,139
that I have failed to keep...

158
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,058
my promise.

159
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,689
We are only saying goodbye
for a short while.

160
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,941
We can gather back together...

161
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,485
and make a better world again.

162
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,240
Yes.

163
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,577
I am sure that world will come
even though I failed.

164
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,455
Do not lose hope.

165
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:22,209
Make sure you survive
until the very end.

166
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:28,465
Okay, I hope we will
be able to meet again.

167
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,265
You should go.

168
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,183
Get going.

169
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,314
Hurry up and go.

170
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,000
I took all the gisaengs
to the government office.

171
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:04,710
Okay.

172
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,546
They are all beautiful and talented,

173
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,715
so they will do great
no matter where they go.

174
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,092
Lady Kim...

175
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,845
I mean, that man...

176
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,557
- Where did he...
- He is in Songju Valley.

177
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,644
He is in very bad condition.

178
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,606
It was shameless of him
to pretend like he was a woman.

179
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,941
But if he had not risked his life
to save our village...

180
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,068
You must have grown on him.

181
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,820
I have never seen you...

182
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,115
take someone's side like this.

183
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,660
That is not it.

184
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,120
At this point,

185
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,831
I no longer have the power...

186
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,334
to harm anyone.

187
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,838
Where will you be going now?

188
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,885
I should try to do what I can.

189
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,262
I will go to Hanyang...

190
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,389
and meet the chancellor.

191
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,391
So you should hurry up...

192
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,268
- and follow the others...
- I swore...

193
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,189
that I would always stay
by your side.

194
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,152
Wait here. I will bring a horse.

195
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,832
I have no idea
where the widows have gone.

196
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,877
On top of that,
he could have killed me there.

197
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,588
But he let me live saying
I should go back and warn you.

198
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,506
Grand Prince Neungyang,
that darn little...

199
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,967
His Majesty will soon hear
about what happened at the village.

200
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,886
You should not do anything.

201
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,101
Go and get some rest.

202
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,652
Why did you try to kill us?

203
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,821
Who on earth am I?

204
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,657
He might be...

205
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,577
our way out of this.

206
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,113
It will be useless to run away.

207
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,490
So just hurry up and jump.

208
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,202
Then we will say you killed yourself
to keep your integrity.

209
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,235
Why would you even
look down that cliff?

210
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,697
What you need to protect
is your life, not your integrity.

211
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,995
Let us go, and keep your chin up.

212
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,013
Who is there?

213
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,223
- Catch him!
- Yes, master!

214
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,268
Come this way.

215
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:48,785
Stay here.

216
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:46,885
Lady Chun.

217
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,271
I did not want her journey
to the afterlife to be lonely.

218
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,148
So I called you here even though
you are not in your best condition.

219
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,694
Did the bandits do this to her?

220
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,073
How... How could she
just die like this?

221
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,869
Lady Chun.

222
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,496
Whoever it was,

223
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,291
I will find him and kill him...

224
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,334
at all costs.

225
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,637
I thought you had left me.

226
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,474
I had a dream.

227
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,352
And you left me.

228
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,853
What a silly dream.

229
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,358
I will not leave. So get some sleep.

230
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,568
I do not want to.

231
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,725
Gosh.

232
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,604
You should not be...

233
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,816
moving right now, punk.

234
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,986
What? Why...

235
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,823
- Where is Dong Joo?
- What?

236
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,785
Well... She...

237
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:19,788
Hold on.

238
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:23,834
You should not be moving right now.
Hey.

239
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,335
Wait.

240
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:28,714
That punk.

241
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,674
How many days have you been here
already? You have not recovered yet.

242
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,303
I doubt that she will come back.
She was determined to leave.

243
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,600
I am not waiting for her.

244
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,269
I just came out for some fresh air.

245
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,065
I think I see some tears over there.

246
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,320
It is because the wind is cold.

247
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,824
Usually, first love
is heartbreaking.

248
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,410
How could she leave
without saying goodbye?

249
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,580
She said she was worried
that I might die.

250
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:45,791
Not without a word.

251
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,256
You know the head
of the gisaeng house?

252
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,717
Why? What happened to her?

253
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,095
When she was running away,

254
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:01,098
she was attacked by some
of the bandits who stayed behind.

255
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,351
My goodness.

256
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,313
They buried her well.

257
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,983
The vice-curator wanted
to keep it a secret...

258
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,985
until you got better.

259
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:14,570
Are you all right?

260
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:18,949
I must go.

261
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,701
Yes. It is cold. Let us go back.

262
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,495
- To Hanyang.
- Hanyang?

263
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,248
You should not
overexert yourself yet.

264
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,083
There is a conversation
I have not finished yet.

265
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:34,965
Goodness.

266
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,468
I am going to leave.

267
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,679
What are you talking about?

268
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,473
You stayed up several nights
and did not get a wink of sleep.

269
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:44,808
I must leave.

270
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,186
That is why...

271
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,855
I will stay with him
as much as I want now.

272
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,774
I will look at him
as much as I want...

273
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,902
and stay next to him.

274
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:58,989
Nok Du will not know.

275
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,742
It will only be brief.

276
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,785
He is badly hurt.

277
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,704
You will leave him behind like this?

278
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:07,873
If he wakes up,

279
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,792
I do not think I can leave then.
That is why.

280
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,754
My gosh.

281
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,672
Please do not tell him...

282
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,509
that I was clingy.

283
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,721
Tell him that I left
without any worries.

284
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,349
Please tell him that.

285
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:27,559
Gosh.

286
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,907
Is he heartbroken
because he does not know?

287
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,702
Or will he be more heartbroken
if he finds out?

288
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,074
What? None?

289
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,200
You cannot find the people...

290
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,326
that raided the village
and killed the widows...

291
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,828
or any survivors from the raid.

292
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,789
The witness who was being
transported under my order died.

293
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,208
But you have failed
to find the culprit behind it?

294
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:39,965
What do you know then?

295
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,092
What can you do for me?

296
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,719
I asked what you could do for me!

297
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:44,928
Well...

298
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:47,389
I was informed that the head
of the gisaeng house...

299
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:50,100
visited Lord Heo
on the day of the raid.

300
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,570
It is Yun again?

301
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,419
Have you not heard any news
about Dong Joo?

302
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,506
No. I am searching
everywhere to locate her.

303
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,966
I must find her.

304
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,385
If she refuses to come,

305
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,764
bring her to me by force.

306
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,603
And if he is with her,
kill him on the spot.

307
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,188
Yes.

308
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,569
You have quite dexterous hands.

309
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:44,655
Even your brushstrokes
are different.

310
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:49,952
How much is it?

311
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,663
I will give it to you for a coin.
Just take it.

312
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:53,747
Really?

313
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,043
If you sell these at cheap prices,
how can you make a living?

314
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,379
Well...

315
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,715
I can make a living
if you help me out a bit.

316
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,885
Do you think I can get a job
as a servant at the palace?

317
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,785
Until when will you follow me?

318
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,080
Right. You said you would
accompany us to Hanyang.

319
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,665
Let us go our separate ways now.

320
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,711
Do you have a place to stay?

321
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,881
Well, we will take care of that.

322
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,507
Goodbye.

323
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,305
You know what?

324
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,184
Why does he still look at you
with sorrow in his eyes?

325
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,268
What?

326
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,855
Right. When you were
sleeping last night,

327
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:02,107
he was glued to you.

328
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:06,278
"No. That cannot be true."

329
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,447
He said that.

330
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,365
That is ridiculous.

331
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,034
He definitely saw that I am a man.

332
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:17,414
What? What is it? What?

333
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,840
This is good.

334
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:31,553
So you will help us
start a life in Hanyang?

335
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:33,722
What?

336
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,849
Do you think
I am doing this for you?

337
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,059
You wish.

338
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,727
I am only helping you...

339
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,897
because I am worried
about this old man here and Aeng Du.

340
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:46,568
Do you not agree?
I believe we have bonded.

341
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:49,154
I feel like we are a family.

342
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,658
I am going to call you brother
from now on.

343
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,201
Okay.

344
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,956
We cannot inconvenience you
like that.

345
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,041
After what happened
to the village for widows,

346
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,086
you may be punished.

347
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,631
Well, you see,

348
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,883
I am prepared for the worst.

349
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,802
"Punishment", you said?

350
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,888
If I must receive it, then I shall.

351
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,183
This is how I feel.

352
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:20,561
Hanyang is a dog-eat-dog city,

353
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,063
so I am worried
about how you will manage.

354
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:26,191
Although I am not too worried...

355
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,528
Just listen to me.

356
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:32,072
I will charge you the expenses
with interest for my services later.

357
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,242
Let us go.

358
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,827
Where?

359
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,579
We need a place to stay.

360
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:39,621
Never mind.

361
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,292
We should do something
about those tacky clothes.

362
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,255
Are you not done?

363
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,091
I bet a fly would plummet
down this garment.

364
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,676
Like this.

365
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,970
I cannot wait any longer.

366
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,496
Goodness, you are still beautiful.

367
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,415
- You are...
- What?

368
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:25,667
I am talking about your clothing.

369
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:29,546
You are finally looking
like someone from Hanyang.

370
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,672
Finally.

371
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,966
Are you sure you can spend
this much money?

372
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,760
I am remarkable in many ways.

373
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,638
But I have a lot of money.
Quite a bit.

374
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,765
- So do not worry.
- Is that so?

375
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,727
Goodness, you looked quite humble,

376
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,395
so I had no idea.

377
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,565
I do not need such...

378
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,400
clothes.

379
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:54,238
You will be my cousin
who left Hanyang a long time ago.

380
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:55,531
When you were less than 10,

381
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:58,075
you moved to the south
because you were fragile.

382
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,244
And then, we lost contact.

383
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,663
And now, you came back.

384
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:03,914
What do you say?

385
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:07,251
Seeing how you disguised as a woman
in the village for widows,

386
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:09,670
you must have some sort of a story.

387
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,588
Are you sure
I am not inconveniencing you?

388
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,383
If it was not for you people,

389
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,344
I would have died. I owe you one.

390
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:21,598
You will take our family's surname.

391
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:23,600
You will be Yeon Soo.

392
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,645
Yeon Soo.

393
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:29,106
All right, let us look for a house.

394
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,975
What a horrible wench.

395
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,705
How long will you use it?

396
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:37,716
What did you say?

397
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,635
I am waiting.

398
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,178
To get on this swing?

399
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:43,305
Yes.

400
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:49,269
You want to ride this swing.

401
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:59,071
I have not been on it for that long.

402
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,368
Fine, then.

403
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:07,371
I will wait a bit more.

404
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,421
You look like you have a worry.

405
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,425
Yes, I do.

406
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,555
Can I ask about it?

407
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,643
I am afraid that I will find out...

408
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:32,187
about something I do not
want to know about...

409
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,023
although I should.

410
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,362
You are like me.

411
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:44,074
Are you going to run away?

412
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,291
No.

413
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,376
I must take the bull by the horns.

414
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:57,754
Wait a minute.

415
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,634
Have we met before?

416
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:06,388
I am not sure.

417
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,768
See you again.

418
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,271
If fate allows.

419
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,245
I think I have seen him somewhere.

420
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,695
You must answer...

421
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:06,490
my question this time.

422
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,409
Follow me.

423
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:26,927
Father.

424
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,470
Nok Du.

425
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,681
Nok Du!

426
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,058
- Father!
- Nok Du!

427
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,495
You must have gone through so much.

428
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,998
Father...

429
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:01,003
Why are you locked in here?

430
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:04,840
I am not locked in here.
He is an old friend of mine.

431
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:08,635
He will not harm us anymore,
so do not worry.

432
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,471
He is a friend?

433
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,727
Why did your friend try to kill us?

434
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,772
And now, he will no longer try
to harm us?

435
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:22,774
Is it because...

436
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:26,987
I am...

437
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:31,491
Do not say a thing.
Do not ask anything.

438
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:35,287
I despised Mother so much.

439
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:39,291
She was always more affectionate
towards Hwang Tae.

440
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,338
Let us leave
and find your brother together.

441
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,673
She lived her entire life
in the void...

442
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,009
and passed away
without receiving any medication.

443
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,971
So how could I not have
any questions?

444
00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,645
Who am I?

445
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,482
Who am I?

446
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,280
No.

447
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:12,407
I must take the bull by the horns.

448
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:16,828
Am I...

449
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:20,707
His Majesty's...

450
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,418
son?

451
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,881
I do not know what you have heard,
but that is not true.

452
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:28,966
You are...

453
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,677
You are my son.

454
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:44,481
I will not hear the truth
that I am desperate...

455
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,484
to find out, will I?

456
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,820
Neither from you...

457
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:52,614
nor your old friend.

458
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,075
- Nok Du...
- I will be back.

459
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,368
Where are you going?

460
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:58,787
I am going to right the wrong.

461
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,582
And I am going to make sure...

462
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,418
you and Hwang Tae
live honorable lives.

463
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:07,713
Please be healthy.

464
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,424
No, Nok Du!

465
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,717
Let me go!

466
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:13,760
Nok Du!

467
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,021
You may not leave.

468
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,648
Please follow me quietly.

469
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:27,649
No.

470
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,086
How much...

471
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:30,629
does Nok Du know?

472
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,965
What about you?
How much do you know?

473
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,844
Why do you think His Majesty...

474
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:40,639
wanted to get rid of his own son
20 years ago?

475
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:43,684
He was even willing to kill you.
Why do you think he did that?

476
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,954
(Inn)

477
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:36,737
Your Majesty.

478
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:05,766
Your Majesty!

479
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:17,778
Your Majesty!

480
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:26,912
My goodness.

481
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:40,008
My gosh.

482
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:41,927
You startled me.

483
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,011
Master.

484
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,138
I need to enter the palace.

485
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,599
I must find out for myself.

486
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,851
I must do it myself.

487
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:02,322
Were you the only one...

488
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,950
who managed to live that day?

489
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:22,759
I was the only one
who was still alive.

490
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,180
Therefore, I was the only one...

491
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,684
who was able to stay alive.

492
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,985
If what you just said
turns out to be a lie,

493
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,362
I will put an end...

494
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,741
to your life myself.

495
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,630
Keep an eye on both of them.
Make sure they do not go anywhere.

496
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:00,672
Yes, Your Majesty.

497
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:30,160
You guys do not like it either,
do you?

498
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:34,122
The one Dong Joo made
was nice and sturdy.

499
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,043
So what if she is good
at making things?

500
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,671
She is a mean brat
who has no sense of responsibility.

501
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,172
Yes, of course.

502
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,424
This is obviously very hard to get.

503
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,134
But I gave you my word,

504
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,594
so I should keep it.

505
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:49,596
I heard your skin...

506
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,765
turns shiny and bright
once you wash your face with this.

507
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,977
Here you go.
You should give it a try.

508
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,646
You are giving us
something so precious.

509
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,483
If you are bribing us
so you could get a job...

510
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,527
Yes, that is exactly
what I am doing.

511
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,987
So can you please...

512
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:06,989
I should get going.

513
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:10,617
But I am really capable
of doing anything.

514
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:13,954
Thank you for this.

515
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,502
My gosh, those darn brats.

516
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:23,255
It would be easier
to climb over the palace wall.

517
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,840
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

518
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,385
Hello, what can I help you with?

519
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,637
I am getting ready to take
the military service exam.

520
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:32,681
And I need a bow to practice with.

521
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,517
I would also like
a variety of arrowheads.

522
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:37,728
Okay, sure. Let me see.

523
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,314
This will be a nice bow for you.

524
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:42,524
And as for the arrows,
I will give you ones...

525
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:44,193
made of wood and steel...

526
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,277
By the way,

527
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:48,697
do you remember the man
who bought magnetites here?

528
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:52,201
He is small, short,
and has fair skin.

529
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:53,535
"Magnetites"?

530
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:56,246
Oh, are you talking
about the pretty-looking man?

531
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,247
Yes, that is correct.

532
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,541
Has he come by recently?

533
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,793
No, that was
the last time I saw him.

534
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:04,338
He does not come that often.

535
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:05,547
But he still came
every once in a while,

536
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,216
so I am sure he will visit again.

537
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:08,675
Here we go.

538
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,428
- There.
- Today,

539
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:13,639
I will just take this.

540
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,850
I will come back tomorrow
and the day after to buy the rest.

541
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,852
Okay, but that would be
such a hassle.

542
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,279
Should we have fun on the swing?

543
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,407
Are you a little kid?

544
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,117
I cannot help it.

545
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,704
We just need to be back
before sunset.

546
00:50:58,725 --> 00:50:59,726
Excuse me.

547
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,480
Did you rent the swing?

548
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:05,858
The kids are waiting in line.

549
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,610
Oh, right.

550
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:10,404
I am sorry.

551
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,156
It is our turn!

552
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:35,512
He is kind...

553
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,139
but indifferent.

554
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,392
He is so attractive.

555
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:47,482
I am here to buy a book to prepare
for the military service exam.

556
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,359
You can find it inside.

557
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,244
I guess we were meant to meet again.

558
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:01,705
What brings you here?

559
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:04,249
I had a lot on my mind,

560
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:07,127
but I figured you might be
on the swing.

561
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,048
Are you getting ready to take
the military service exam?

562
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:12,925
Yes.

563
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,761
I need to enter the palace.

564
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:19,556
And I think I will do better at this
than the civil service exam.

565
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,684
"The palace"?

566
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:24,520
Why do you need to enter the palace?

567
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:28,607
I need to meet His Majesty.

568
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,900
"His Majesty"?

569
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,071
It does not sound like you wish
to meet him for a good cause.

570
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:37,741
I need to meet him...

571
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:42,788
so that I can become successful.

572
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,706
I want to win His Majesty's favor.

573
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:52,005
What is your name?

574
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:58,512
My name is Yeon Soo.

575
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:01,598
You are from the same family...

576
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,392
as the former chief royal secretary.

577
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,062
Yes, that is correct.

578
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:10,774
Then I should give you something...

579
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:12,901
to root for your success.

580
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:14,611
Let us meet here again...

581
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,488
in five days around 3pm.

582
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,033
But...

583
00:53:38,552 --> 00:53:39,678
Are you that dumb?

584
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,555
You should have dried
your feet first.

585
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,098
Forget it. Let us just go.

586
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,350
If your feet are cold,
you will catch a cold.

587
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:46,685
You will make my life harder
if you do.

588
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,112
You will make my life harder
if you do.

589
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:24,473
I do not have the right to cry.

590
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,905
You said you are capable
of doing anything, right?

591
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:41,156
Pardon?

592
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,994
You want me to find a man?

593
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:49,414
I have been hanging around there
whenever I come out,

594
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:51,667
but I cannot seem to meet him again.

595
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,504
Of course, I am a woman
of His Majesty.

596
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:58,423
But I just want to talk to him.

597
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,552
Well, since he saved me
from getting hurt,

598
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:04,054
I just want to give him
a small reward.

599
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:05,639
I see.

600
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,850
But...

601
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,770
this is like trying
to find a needle in a haystack.

602
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,147
I kicked out the servant
who was working for me.

603
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,025
How does he look?

604
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:28,287
He was wearing
a beautiful pink gown.

605
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,373
And he was wearing a hat
with a fancy string with amethyst.

606
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:34,585
He has a chiseled jawline.

607
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:38,005
And his skin is fairer
than any women's.

608
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:39,715
That is not all.

609
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,925
His eyes...

610
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:45,637
They were deep and sorrowful
with full of stories.

611
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,768
Darn it.

612
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:55,647
He has to at least look
like a human being.

613
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:57,774
I can come out again in four days.

614
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,611
Tell him to meet me
at the swing that night.

615
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:02,529
Why at the swing?

616
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,161
Well, he can change into new gowns.

617
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:11,830
But he would not change
his fancy strings often.

618
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,711
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.
I must find him by tonight.

619
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:20,589
Goodness.
I must find him no matter what.

620
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:40,192
My lord. My lord!

621
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,112
My lord. My lord! Excuse me.

622
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,284
What is this about?

623
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,454
Dazzling eyes.

624
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:54,456
Chiseled jawline.

625
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,917
And his skin is considered
somewhat fair.

626
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:59,294
He might be the guy.

627
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:02,965
Pink and amethyst.

628
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,467
Are you done?

629
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,762
I am sorry.

630
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:13,475
Have you been to the swing
around here a few days ago?

631
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:16,979
Have I been to the swing
a few days ago?

632
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,773
Yes. I have.

633
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:22,776
Nice.

634
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,529
I understand
that it is rude to ask you this.

635
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:26,780
Do you think you could be...

636
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,866
at the swing tonight around 11pm?

637
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:31,410
There is a woman
who wants to meet you.

638
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,871
- Me?
- Yes.

639
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:36,123
She just wants to reward you.

640
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:39,501
I mean, she just wants
to talk to you.

641
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:41,170
To me?

642
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:42,629
Yes.

643
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,424
Please. I am begging you.

644
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,384
Be there around 11pm.
Please do not forget.

645
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:51,555
I will take that as a yes
and tell her so.

646
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,223
You promised.

647
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,604
Goodness.

648
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:09,198
I am sorry for making you wait.

649
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:10,365
I see.

650
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,953
By the way, your clothes...

651
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:16,038
Yes.

652
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:20,000
Not only do we share the same fate,
but also the same taste in clothes.

653
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,254
Here. Take it.

654
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,425
What is this?

655
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:29,593
It is taffy.

656
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:32,262
I hope you pass your exam.

657
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:35,516
Thank you.

658
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,518
I do not know how to repay.

659
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,436
You can repay me
by passing the exam.

660
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:42,439
If you do, do not be a stranger.

661
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:43,732
Of course, not.

662
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,986
All right. Go on now.

663
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,863
You must be busy
with your preparation for the exam.

664
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:50,948
Okay.

665
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:04,336
Okay. How is the chancellor doing?

666
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,171
He has been quiet.

667
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:10,759
And you told me to look
into the grandson of the Yeons.

668
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:12,845
He was physically very weak.

669
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:16,473
So he went to a rural area
in order to take care of his health.

670
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:18,642
And they have not heard
from him since then.

671
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:20,894
They have not heard from him?

672
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:22,020
No.

673
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:39,288
Come on. I said you should not
do any straining moves yet.

674
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,331
Okay.

675
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,042
Wait, that is...

676
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,210
This?

677
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:47,713
You mentioned bellflowers
from the island.

678
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:50,716
Bellflowers are all over our island,
but it was so hard to find it here.

679
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,387
This reminds me of your father.

680
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,681
He used to eat this around this time
because of his coughs.

681
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:58,807
He did, did he not?

682
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:02,144
By the way, why do you want this?

683
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:26,001
Who are you?

684
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:36,470
Follow me quietly.

685
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:45,521
Nok Du.

686
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,832
He is a man in the black mask.
I cut a piece of his sleeve.

687
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:06,959
Go after him.

688
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,085
- Yes!
- Yes!

689
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:34,736
He is coming. There he is.

690
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:43,287
- There you are.
- My gosh. Who is that?

691
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,539
You crazy wench!

692
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,627
Wait. Hold on.

693
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:56,466
You asked me to come here.
Where are you going?

694
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,551
Pardon?

695
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:00,721
Well, I think
I must have been mistaken.

696
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,724
I do not think you were the man
I was looking for.

697
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,517
Who were you looking for?

698
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,227
Well,

699
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:09,521
it was about...

700
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:11,773
love between a man and a woman.

701
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:13,734
It is hard to tell you in detail.

702
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,737
Anyway, I am so sorry.

703
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,239
I will get going now. I am sorry.

704
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:21,241
Wait. Hey.

705
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,329
- Gosh.
- Your Majesty.

706
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:29,791
A man came to visit Jung Yun Jeo
and ran away in a hurry.

707
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:30,959
Did you see his face?

708
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,669
I did not have a chance,

709
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:36,715
but his sleeve was cut,
and his name was Nok Du.

710
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:38,550
"Nok Du"?

711
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:39,927
Yes.

712
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,764
We must catch him at all costs.

713
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:45,557
We must.

714
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:46,725
Yes, Your Majesty.

715
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:42,072
Excuse me!

716
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,536
I saw a suspicious man
going that way.

717
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:48,537
Go after him.

718
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,705
- Right away.
- Right away.

719
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:43,717
You...

720
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:50,057
I need to get out of here.

721
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,141
No.

722
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:53,435
You cannot.

723
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:59,149
I will attract
their attention somehow.

724
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,192
You should hide here.

725
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:01,276
No.

726
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:03,612
I will not let you leave again.

727
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,614
Never.

728
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:07,444
(The Tale of Nokdu)

729
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:10,113
Did you just say
it was the chancellor's order?

730
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:12,074
I will help you take your revenge.

731
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:14,701
What do you think
about dethroning the current king...

732
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:17,913
and making him
succeed to the throne?

733
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:19,414
You can walk in here freely,

734
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:21,124
but you cannot leave freely.

735
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:24,753
Unbelievable. You guys
have no business ethics.

736
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:26,046
She belongs to me.

737
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:27,881
She is busy trying to pay me back.

738
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:29,633
Are you going to leave me again?

739
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,844
Are you trying
to keep her next to you?

740
01:07:31,927 --> 01:07:34,763
They are trying hard
to pretend to keep their distance.

741
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,473
You will enter the palace?

742
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:37,808
You will be in front of the King?

743
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:39,309
I was told
that my family could come.

744
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:42,020
That means
I will get to see the King, right?
