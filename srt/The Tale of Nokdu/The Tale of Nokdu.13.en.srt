5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,856
(Episode 25)

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
Did something happen?

7
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,166
You despise him...

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,751
with all your heart and are
desperately trying to kill...

9
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:43,877
that darn King.

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,171
He is the King's...

11
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,926
He is the son of that King.

12
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,599
No.

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,434
Nothing happened.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,771
I was just exhausted the whole day.

15
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,234
I was busy and got tired.

16
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,194
That was it.

17
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,742
I see.

18
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,539
What about you?

19
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,000
Same here.

20
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,378
Work can get hard.

21
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,867
What about the beach?

22
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,577
Let us go some other time.

23
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,622
We can go there some other time.

24
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,234
I will go in.

25
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,239
What is it?

26
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,491
I will make sure
we go to the beach...

27
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,326
next time.

28
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,038
Yes. That was the promise.

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,791
Go in.

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,115
You even went into prison
to see His Majesty.

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,449
But you left without talking to him.

32
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,412
You must have found out
who the prisoner is.

33
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,501
It seems as if you found out
something worse than that.

34
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,588
Right.

35
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,632
As if abandoning his own son
was not enough,

36
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,343
he was still desperately
trying to kill his own son.

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,054
I doubt that you wanted
to give him the evidence.

38
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,349
And whether or not I will change
my mind depends on you.

39
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,643
Do not bother my brother.

40
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,646
And promise me that you will not go
after the disbanded Muweol Corps.

41
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,816
If anyone gets hurt...

42
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,067
That will not be hard
to comply with.

43
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,236
I will keep my eye on you.

44
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,450
However,
there might be an easier way.

45
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,915
We can work together.

46
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,920
- What?
- I will not have to worry...

47
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,713
that you have
the evidence against me.

48
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,299
And you can guarantee the safety
of the people you mentioned...

49
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,510
and avenge...

50
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,054
your father who abandoned you
in the cruelest way...

51
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:24,681
with me.

52
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,767
Crazy jerk.

53
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,229
I will give you two days
to consider my offer.

54
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,813
Consider my offer.

55
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
You may not enter.

56
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,080
When His Majesty is not inside,

57
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,540
no one can enter.

58
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,419
- Well, I...
- It was his royal command.

59
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,313
I want everyone to leave me...

60
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,647
and Chief Administrative
Officer Yeon alone.

61
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,567
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,339
So I heard you had something
to report to me.

63
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,134
Yes.

64
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,136
However, it is no longer important.

65
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,806
What do you mean?

66
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,392
I was going to report to you...

67
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,980
that we detected a trace
of Jung Yun Jeo in Hanyang.

68
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,857
But you saw
that he was already arrested...

69
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,318
and went back.

70
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,404
Yes.

71
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,281
Did you hear it?

72
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,076
Yes.

73
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,379
However, I did not hear it.

74
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,549
What?

75
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,385
I did not hear the past incident
which you do not want me...

76
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,303
to find out. However,

77
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,599
I just heard a story
about your loneliness.

78
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,735
Will you give it a try?

79
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,126
Yun Jeo was the same way.

80
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,629
He noticed hardships of my life
and my loneliness.

81
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,841
And he embraced me
as a true friend.

82
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,055
However, it was all a lie.

83
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,436
I will not forgive him.

84
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,147
I will not be deceived anymore.

85
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,108
I will get that boy...

86
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,861
and kill him.

87
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,882
I will appoint you as a royal guard.

88
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,718
Will you stay by my side...

89
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,304
and protect me...

90
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,933
for a very long time?

91
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,660
I am forever grateful, Your Majesty.

92
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,788
I will gratefully accept it.

93
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,893
Is he not
that chief administrative officer...

94
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,228
who visits at times?

95
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,108
Oh, my. When did he become
a royal guard?

96
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,821
A royal guard?

97
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,073
He will stay by the King's side
and guard him.

98
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,534
Did you not know that?

99
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,764
What are you doing?

100
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,559
We have so much work to do.
Let us hurry.

101
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,519
Okay.

102
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,609
It is tough, is it not?

103
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,528
You tried so hard to work here,

104
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,740
but the workload is not
that little, is it?

105
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,329
Yes. It is hard.

106
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,665
I want to give up on everything.

107
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,418
Poor you. I did think...

108
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,420
that Court Lady Kim made you work
too much.

109
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,506
I had wanted to do this
for a very long time...

110
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,301
and never thought of doing
anything else.

111
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,555
I do not know what to do
if I were to quit.

112
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,226
I do not know if I should quit.

113
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,896
I have no idea.

114
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,150
Why would you put
your life on stake for this job?

115
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,445
You are doing well, so do not worry.

116
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,087
What are you doing?

117
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,090
What happened last night?

118
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,967
You must be tired,
so let us go first.

119
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,426
I will explain once we get there.

120
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,136
No.

121
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,349
I will not go. I will no longer be
at your mercy.

122
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,893
- Hwang Tae.
- I told you not to call me that.

123
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,145
My real name is Jung Yi Hyung.

124
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,939
We are not related.

125
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,484
I want to retrieve my name,
my family, and live my life.

126
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,819
Is that too much to ask for?

127
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,405
Why do you keep bothering me?

128
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,115
Father...

129
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,535
is locked up in the royal prison.

130
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,163
What?

131
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,922
I know that it is all because of me.

132
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,301
I will save him.

133
00:11:58,677 --> 00:11:59,678
How?

134
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,472
Will you beg your biological father?

135
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,853
Everyone will know...

136
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,648
what the King did 20 years ago.

137
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,067
- What?
- Then he will not be able...

138
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,319
to enter the prison.

139
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,070
That is when I will go save him.

140
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,448
You will tell everyone?

141
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,575
You will tell them
about how you were abandoned...

142
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,243
and how your life was
up until now?

143
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,416
No.

144
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,127
It will be quicker
for Grand Prince Neungyang...

145
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,504
to take the throne and help me.

146
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,797
I will make that happen...

147
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,925
and save Father, so do not worry.

148
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,051
Hwang Tae.

149
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,989
(20 years ago...)

150
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:09,540
(20 years ago...)

151
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,166
Eat up.

152
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,751
Thank you.

153
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,965
Hey, read this.

154
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,680
The King not only abandoned
his son, but also tried to kill him.

155
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,307
I am telling you.

156
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,915
(20 years ago...)

157
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,298
What did you say?

158
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,968
Your Majesty, it is nothing
but a vulgar rumor.

159
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,053
Who said it?

160
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,891
I want him to be killed
before my eyes!

161
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,987
If you react to the rumor,

162
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,114
your people will believe
that it is true.

163
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,410
Then what should I do?

164
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,954
You should not do anything.

165
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,042
Then the rumor will dissipate
on its own.

166
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,129
Do you think so?

167
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,464
Yes, Your Majesty.

168
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,841
Also, since there are
people watching,

169
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,010
I think you should refrain
from visiting the royal prison.

170
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,137
If the criminal needs
to be monitored,

171
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,264
I will do that.

172
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,809
There is a risk that he may say
something untrue to someone else.

173
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,315
Yes. Do so.

174
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,361
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,047
Father.

176
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,179
Why are you here?

177
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,348
Get out this instant.

178
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,308
You should not be here.

179
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,476
If the King finds out...

180
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,561
Why did you do it?

181
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,900
What do you mean?

182
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,362
Why did you have to save me
and get locked up in here?

183
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,575
- Nok Du.
- Why did you let Mother die?

184
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,869
And for Hwang Tae...

185
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,164
Why did you take care of me?

186
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,002
Do not say that.

187
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,671
Just like what the King said,

188
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,175
I should have just died.

189
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,342
Stop it!

190
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,429
How dare you say that
in front of your father?

191
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,638
You should know better!

192
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,057
You should have just abandoned me.

193
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,359
You seemed lifeless at first.

194
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,113
Then suddenly, you started crying.

195
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,909
That tiny body of yours was
telling me that you were alive.

196
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,578
You were telling me
that you were not dead.

197
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,790
What I did was neither impressive
nor difficult.

198
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,794
I just did what I had to do
as a human being.

199
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,799
But the consequence
of your actions...

200
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,888
is very brutal.

201
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,061
Even if I could go back in time,

202
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,523
I would save you once again.

203
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,069
So value your life.

204
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,946
Leave the palace right now.

205
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,241
No. I will neither run away
nor hide.

206
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,370
I am sorry
to keep you here, Father.

207
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:18,997
I will save you soon.

208
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,207
Nok Du!

209
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,207
I came to see you.

210
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:07,713
I will go now that I have.

211
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,051
Let us go to the beach.

212
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,321
I thought you wanted
to go to the beach.

213
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,199
I did not know
it would be so far away.

214
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,911
We sneaked out during working hours,
so we had no choice.

215
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,538
Did you want to go to the beach
that badly?

216
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,083
I do not mind whether or not
we go to the beach.

217
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,546
I have you beside me.

218
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,131
That is enough to make me happy.

219
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,638
Stop being so corny...

220
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,014
and just eat this.

221
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,151
I guess you made this yourself.

222
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,570
Why did you do that?

223
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,447
You are so fussy.

224
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,783
I knew it ever since we were
at the village for widows.

225
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,118
You should try it yourself.

226
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,745
I am not hungry.

227
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,121
Have a bite.

228
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,415
No, I do not want to eat it.

229
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,409
I am not fussy,
but you are temperamental.

230
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,078
You grabbed me by my collar
the moment we first met.

231
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,788
You always pushed me and hit me.

232
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,540
And do you not remember
how mean you were to me?

233
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,876
Hey, you were the one
who treated me like a slave...

234
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,460
and asked me for all sorts of stuff.

235
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,129
Are you kidding me?

236
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,090
I applied ointment on you,
did the laundry, and even cooked.

237
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,508
I did so many things for you.

238
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,010
You are unbelievable.

239
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,970
You are unbelievable...

240
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,139
for coming to that village
and pretending to be a widow...

241
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,142
when you were a man.

242
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:31,857
Yes, I know.

243
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,651
I will tell you why I went there.

244
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,988
I had always been curious
of whom I really was.

245
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,158
And I went there to find out.

246
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,244
I thought the person
who knew about it would be there.

247
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,497
So...

248
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,125
did you find out...

249
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,544
whom you really are?

250
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,172
Yes, I found out...

251
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:56,882
about everything.

252
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,843
So I am planning
to set things straight.

253
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,555
I need to protect my father.

254
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,200
We should go back now.
It is getting late.

255
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,229
The battle between the Ming Dynasty
and the Later Jin...

256
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,898
is becoming more and more serious.

257
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,401
Therefore, I think we should
hurry up and send our troops...

258
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,194
for reinforcement, Your Majesty.

259
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,948
The people of our country have not
recovered from the Japanese battle.

260
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,702
I cannot send them
to another battle.

261
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,829
I refuse to send an army.

262
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:09,955
Your Majesty.

263
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,499
Have you forgotten
the help we received?

264
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,128
The reason we were able to defeat
the Japanese was because...

265
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,629
we received help
from the Ming Dynasty.

266
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,131
"Help"?

267
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,509
No, they never helped us.

268
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,054
They just came because they did not
want the battle to reach their land.

269
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,973
On top of that, they were not
even interested in fighting.

270
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,309
They returned to their country
after having done nothing...

271
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,560
but exploited my people.

272
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,731
Your Majesty.

273
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:39,026
How could you
say something so terrible?

274
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:42,029
If it were not for the kindness
of the Ming Dynasty...

275
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,238
"Kindness"?

276
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,493
How can you all be so sure of that?

277
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,457
I experienced the cruelness
of that battle firsthand.

278
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,710
You were all busy running away!

279
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,547
Your constant disregard
for our country's duty...

280
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,133
is exactly why people are
spreading ugly rumors about...

281
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,554
What? "Rumors"?

282
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,433
Excuse me.

283
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,688
Court Lady Kim sent me here
on her behalf.

284
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,065
Oh, I see.

285
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,072
Thank you.

286
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,448
Goodbye.

287
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,037
My gosh.

288
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,165
Please come here.

289
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,045
Lady Dong Joo.

290
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,320
What...

291
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,739
What did you just say?

292
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,285
Your Majesty.

293
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,330
I deserve to be killed.

294
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,946
She deserved a proper burial...

295
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,699
so that we could
take care of the grave.

296
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,077
But we had to do it
without anyone noticing.

297
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,163
We are very sorry.

298
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,499
Do not say that.

299
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,669
Thank you so much...

300
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:27,629
for burying her here.

301
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,428
You must have gone through so much.

302
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,348
You had to grow up
in this harsh world all by yourself.

303
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,143
I am so proud of you.

304
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,229
By the way,

305
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,190
what are you doing in Hanyang?

306
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,609
And why are you
working in the palace?

307
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,236
Why would you enter
that scary place?

308
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,323
You are not...

309
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,910
thinking of doing
anything foolish, are you?

310
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,248
Lady Dong Joo,
that will put you in grave danger.

311
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,667
It is not over yet.

312
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,504
What do you mean?

313
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,297
A few days ago,

314
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,509
we were summoned by His Majesty.

315
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,847
He kept asking us
if there were any other survivors.

316
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,558
You must leave.

317
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,560
If he finds out
that you are still alive,

318
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,145
we will all end up dead.

319
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:26,980
Just like what happened back then.

320
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:32,945
Is that what he said?

321
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,197
Did he say he will find everyone
and kill them?

322
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,908
You must get out
of the palace right now.

323
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,993
Do not do anything.

324
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,705
You should go somewhere far away
and stay hidden.

325
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,836
No. I will not run away.

326
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,296
It was so hard to get this far.

327
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,345
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

328
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,850
How dare you...

329
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,269
speak of that nasty rumor...

330
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,771
in my presence at my palace?

331
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,065
So apparently, my son is alive.

332
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,610
Therefore, he is much more
qualified to take the throne.

333
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,363
Fine.
Is there more of this nonsense?

334
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,199
If any of you wants to mention
any other false rumors,

335
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,743
go ahead and tell me.

336
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,662
Go ahead!

337
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,416
Escort His Majesty out.

338
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,043
And the rest of you,
take care of the body.

339
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,461
- Right away.
- Right away.

340
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,508
Your Majesty.

341
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,668
How... How could this happen?

342
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,797
Minister, we cannot turn
a blind eye to this.

343
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,508
Do you not agree?

344
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,745
Father! Father.

345
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,168
No. Father.

346
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:57,130
Father!

347
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:13,480
How...

348
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,984
How could you do this to him?

349
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,069
Father.

350
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,237
Take him away.

351
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,949
Bring back my father.

352
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:28,078
Bring back my father! Father!

353
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,378
This is all your fault.

354
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,298
Had you not saved that boy...

355
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,343
That is not true.

356
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,096
Regardless of my actions,

357
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:32,059
the heinous truth
you tried to cover up...

358
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,061
will not change.

359
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,271
How dare you?

360
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,760
How dare you stop me?

361
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,097
Please. I beg of you, Your Majesty.

362
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,016
Give it back to me.

363
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:16,895
Even if it means
that I must kill him tonight,

364
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,107
I must hear from him
that the boy is dead.

365
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,068
Have you forgotten
all about our conversation?

366
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,112
If you continue,

367
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:28,156
the rumor will spread
before you could stop it.

368
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:11,909
A few days ago,

369
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:14,995
we were summoned by His Majesty.

370
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,373
He kept asking us
if there were any other survivors.

371
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,417
You must leave.

372
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,960
If he finds out
that you are still alive,

373
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:23,587
we will all end up dead.

374
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,214
Just like what happened back then.

375
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,155
Why did you come back in?

376
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,534
What if someone sees you?

377
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,126
Nok Du.

378
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,753
I will make him regret...

379
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:49,965
to have hurt you like this.

380
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:51,967
I will...

381
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:54,803
never forgive him.

382
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,390
What are you planning to do?

383
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,267
I will get back at him.

384
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,687
I will make him shed tears of blood.

385
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,024
I will drag him down
from the throne...

386
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,984
that he is desperately
trying to hold onto.

387
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,028
Do you wish to be just like him?

388
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:15,824
Why not?

389
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:17,910
I will do so...

390
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,079
as long as I can fix
whatever damage I had done.

391
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:22,873
He is...

392
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,210
your father who gave birth to you.

393
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,806
Yes, indeed.

394
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,102
That is why I cannot forgive him.

395
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:46,730
Because he is my father.

396
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:55,864
Nok Du.

397
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,908
Nok Du!

398
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,506
You do not seem so well.

399
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,050
Is there someone wrong?

400
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,804
No.

401
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,307
Then,

402
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,310
is it because
you are disappointed in me?

403
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,480
That will never happen,
Your Majesty.

404
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:34,069
Everyone fears and hates me,
and they turn their backs on me.

405
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,948
So why are you not doing the same?

406
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,076
I am also appalled...

407
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,495
and afraid of what I have become.

408
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:54,882
I will never leave your side.

409
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,690
I will leave the palace
in the early morning two days later.

410
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,318
I will visit my ancestors' graves...

411
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,987
and get some fresh air.

412
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,322
(The king would visit
the late kings' graves.)

413
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,823
If I do that,

414
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,035
everything will get better.

415
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:27,289
Yes, Your Majesty.

416
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,962
Did you summon me, Your Majesty?

417
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:39,259
I believe your workload
is too much for you to handle...

418
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,720
since all you have been doing
was cook at the gisaeng house.

419
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,349
My apologies, Your Majesty.
I will make sure...

420
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,892
Once we return from our visit
to my ancestors' graves,

421
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,102
he will help you.

422
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,316
He is very knowledgeable.

423
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,486
He is bright and is talented
in martial arts.

424
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,321
He will help you find the boy.

425
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,951
Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,460
You must find him.

427
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,004
If you think you might lose him,

428
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,131
you may kill him.

429
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,222
Your Majesty.

430
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,439
What is the reason?

431
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,983
What do you mean?

432
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,569
Why are you doing this to your son?

433
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,197
I would like to know
since I may have to kill him.

434
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,125
He was destined to take the throne.

435
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,044
If he were to live,

436
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,256
I was told that...

437
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,718
he would overthrow me.

438
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,182
After all I have done to get here...

439
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:12,477
Is that...

440
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,192
the only reason?

441
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,325
To me that is...

442
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,369
more than enough reason.

443
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:32,039
Are you happy now?

444
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,723
The shaman had supernatural powers.

445
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,560
But the King killed her.

446
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,355
Why did you bother to ask him?

447
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:58,190
Did you think...

448
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,484
there was a grand reason?

449
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,844
I did not expect you to accept
my offer.

450
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,429
But I do understand that
you must be very shocked.

451
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,140
He tried to kill you
after being swayed...

452
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:33,934
by what a shaman said.

453
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,312
I will make his nightmare come true.

454
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,107
If he is overthrown,

455
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,484
he will not be able to die
as a king.

456
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,116
Let me kill him myself.

457
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:02,814
Did you drink?

458
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:04,816
Yes.

459
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,152
Because I wanted to see you.

460
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,781
Why would you drink
before coming to see me?

461
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,244
Because...

462
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,039
I thought I could say this to you...

463
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:21,041
if I was drunk.

464
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:23,877
Say what?

465
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,464
I wanted to tell you...

466
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,341
to leave me.

467
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,269
Then why did you come here...

468
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,271
instead of the palace?

469
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,068
I think...

470
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,029
I have a similar drinking habit
to yours.

471
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:53,991
I drank because I thought
I could say that to you...

472
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,659
in a drunk state.

473
00:42:57,202 --> 00:43:00,080
But after getting drunk,
I did not want to lie.

474
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,878
I wanted to tell you the truth.

475
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,797
That is why I did not go.

476
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,678
Fine.

477
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:17,014
We should...

478
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,765
This is what I truly wanted to say.

479
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:31,862
Do not leave me.

480
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,118
I know that I am irresponsible
and selfish.

481
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,039
You can blame it on the alcohol.

482
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:43,498
But...

483
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,336
I still...

484
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:49,796
Nok Du.

485
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:07,064
No matter what I do...

486
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,987
Even if I become a terrible person
who committed something heinous,

487
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,240
I wish...

488
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:21,954
you could remain by my side.

489
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,612
I am the one who is terrible.

490
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,327
I should not have done it.

491
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,915
But I was swayed
when you had said...

492
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,587
that you wanted us to love
each other for the time being.

493
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:15,340
I wanted to do that as well.

494
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,138
What are you saying?

495
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:29,396
Let us end this.

496
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,233
We must.

497
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:43,202
Why? Tell me the reason.

498
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,708
No matter what happens or what I do,

499
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,585
it will have nothing to do with you.

500
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,421
Everything...

501
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,674
is my fault, so...

502
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,051
I do not know what you are saying.

503
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:03,805
I am sorry.

504
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:23,700
Tell me.

505
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,037
- Tell you what?
- Why are you abandoning me?

506
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:30,832
There has to be another reason.

507
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,961
Why are you suddenly
acting so strange?

508
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,171
Why are you doing this to me?

509
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:39,341
Why...

510
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,095
must I lose you as well?

511
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:00,529
Please do not leave.

512
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,124
There is nothing I can do for you.

513
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,588
You will get hurt and be in pain...

514
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:18,839
if I stay next to you.

515
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:27,222
What do you mean?

516
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,892
I do not want that.

517
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,187
I do not want to hurt you.

518
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,194
So please let me go.

519
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,911
Are you here to see Dong Joo?

520
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:34,331
- Yes.
- She left the palace this morning.

521
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:38,335
Court Lady Kim will be escorting
the Queen to a Buddhist temple.

522
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:40,712
So she was given a few days off.

523
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,050
Did she tell you
where she will be staying?

524
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,177
No, she did not.

525
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:49,930
Okay.

526
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,358
What is all this?

527
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,778
I am sorry for putting you through
so much trouble.

528
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,907
I know I cannot do anything
to repay you.

529
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:10,534
But please take this.

530
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,202
Lady Dong Joo.

531
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:14,955
Why are you doing this?

532
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,915
What in the world are you planning?

533
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,084
I told you not to do anything.

534
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:21,044
I know you would never dare,

535
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,130
but do not even dream of it.

536
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:25,007
The palace is a scary place.

537
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,218
It is something I must do.

538
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:33,849
I will be off now.

539
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:37,436
But...

540
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:50,032
Did you all see the shock
in everyone's faces?

541
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:54,953
His Majesty dug up his own grave.

542
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:56,455
We are talking about a man's death.

543
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,081
It is not something to be
happy about.

544
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,835
That is why we should dethrone him
as soon as we can.

545
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:03,712
We should do it
before more people get killed.

546
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:06,548
More importantly,
how are things going right now?

547
00:50:06,882 --> 00:50:08,717
We could not find His Majesty's son.

548
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,344
And who spread the rumor?

549
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,805
If His Majesty's son is really
the source of the rumor,

550
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:15,849
would that not put us in danger?

551
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:16,934
I agree.

552
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,896
And where are the Muweol Corps?

553
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,193
There has been a change of plans.

554
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,042
What?

555
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:44,837
What is he doing here?

556
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,213
Say hello, everyone.

557
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,257
He is the son
that everyone is talking about.

558
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,217
Are you saying...

559
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,844
he is His Majesty's son?

560
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:54,304
A son that got abandoned
by His Majesty a long time ago.

561
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,726
He agreed to join our plan.

562
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,271
While we take over the palace,

563
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,148
he will bring us His Majesty.

564
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,278
I am the commander
of the palace guards.

565
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:10,946
I cannot believe
I did not know about this.

566
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:13,115
Would it not be more amusing
to see His Majesty...

567
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,867
get dragged to us by his own son?

568
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:32,050
(Jun Nok Du)

569
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:35,971
(Merit List)

570
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:39,391
- Are we done here?
- If you happen to get swayed,

571
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:42,519
remember that your brother
is with me.

572
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,647
And do not resent me
for he was the one...

573
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,733
who chose to come back again.

574
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:00,996
Keep a close eye on him.

575
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:04,041
I have ordered a few swordsmen
to follow him.

576
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,292
So do not worry.

577
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:07,836
You must find the royal seal
and keep it safe...

578
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,463
while he captures His Majesty...

579
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,508
so that no one will be left
to obey him.

580
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,886
Yes, I am in charge
of the royal seal anyway.

581
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:17,221
So it will be a piece of cake.

582
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,223
There is no need to worry.

583
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,405
Are you really
going to do this with him?

584
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:36,949
He is blinded by hatred.

585
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:38,700
So he will be of good use.

586
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,162
I am trying to dethrone His Majesty
for his lack of morality.

587
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:45,082
So I cannot kill him afterward
because he is my uncle.

588
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,584
But he is willing to kill the King
for me, so I am grateful.

589
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,837
Do not worry.

590
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:53,298
I will not let a scumbag
who killed his own father live.

591
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,050
When his time comes,

592
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,886
you will get to kill him yourself.

593
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:09,147
Hello.

594
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,363
I heard you got promoted.

595
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,116
Congratulations, Royal Guard Yeon.

596
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,577
Thank you.

597
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:24,204
But what brings you
to the police bureau?

598
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:25,956
I heard you will be
escorting the Queen...

599
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,207
to a Buddhist temple tomorrow.

600
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,794
Yes, I will be escorting her.

601
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:35,174
Can you give her this for me?

602
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,093
I picked it up at the palace.

603
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,179
Oh, my.

604
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,055
She looked for this everywhere.

605
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,349
What a relief.

606
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,730
Please take good care
of Her Highness.

607
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:51,315
Pardon?

608
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:53,483
Oh, right.

609
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,611
Yes, of course.

610
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,823
Officer.

611
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,754
A conspiracy?

612
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:15,130
Yes.

613
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:18,717
She is trying to harm His Majesty.

614
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:20,969
So that is exactly what it is.

615
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:23,722
Then are you saying you lied
to His Majesty?

616
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,224
I did not know.

617
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:29,061
I had no idea she was still alive.

618
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,147
I thought she died.

619
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,692
She was not even
10 years old back then.

620
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,406
It seems like she entered
a gisaeng house...

621
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,117
and managed to stay alive.

622
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,912
So where is she right now?

623
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,958
You are...

624
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:54,253
going to keep your promise, right?

625
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,922
You told me that whoever
reports a conspiracy...

626
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:58,632
will be exempted from punishment.

627
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:01,093
That means you will
spare our lives, right?

628
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:03,053
Yes. Now, tell me where she is.

629
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:07,140
Once you pass the marketplace,

630
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:09,768
you will find an inn.

631
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:11,603
Lead the way.

632
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:17,025
I will go.

633
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:19,069
I want you to go to the palace
and report this to His Majesty.

634
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:20,487
Pardon?

635
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:25,617
Okay.

636
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:28,954
I will be on my way
after I report this to His Majesty.

637
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,163
Lead the way.

638
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:49,057
Did you just say...

639
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,059
she was at the gisaeng house
in Mudam Valley?

640
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:52,728
Yes.

641
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:56,106
But apparently,
that gisaeng house disappeared.

642
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:58,609
Once she came to Hanyang,

643
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,944
she got a servant job at the palace.

644
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:07,326
No.

645
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:09,119
That cannot be.

646
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:20,464
(Inn)

647
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,092
Did you happen to see
a woman with short hair?

648
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,636
Oh, her?

649
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:28,889
She left her bag here.
She said she was going out.

650
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,604
Why do you keep
looking for that lady?

651
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:19,022
She is staying
in the room on the end.

652
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:26,864
Kill her as soon as you catch her.
That was the King's order.

653
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,277
Go after her immediately!

654
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,361
- Right away!
- Right away!

655
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:49,423
I cannot tell you.

656
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,467
It is just like how you disguised
yourself as a woman...

657
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:56,138
and why you are here with an alias.

658
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:58,974
I have my reasons too. Understand?

659
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:01,560
Why are you so complicated?

660
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,771
What are you so afraid of?

661
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,151
Why are you so fearless?

662
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:12,404
You do not know
what tomorrow will bring.

663
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,459
I had a task to fulfill.

664
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:28,212
I have been living my whole life
trying to complete my task.

665
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:30,172
Once I was done with it...

666
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:33,383
When I join my mother
after completing my task,

667
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:35,511
I thought I could be really happy.

668
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,722
That was the reason I lived for.

669
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,309
Do you...

670
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,397
know...

671
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,025
who I am?

672
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:13,966
Hurry.

673
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:19,304
Go now.

674
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,393
Hurry.

675
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:51,104
Go now.

676
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:55,067
Live, my baby.

677
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:57,277
Make sure you live, so...

678
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:00,364
Mother.

679
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,743
Royal guard?

680
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,912
The chief administrative officer
I met the other day...

681
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,914
He is the son of the King
whom I saved...

682
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,749
20 years ago.

683
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,627
Yeon Soo is dead?

684
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,255
He died a very long time ago
due to his illness.

685
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:17,881
Then, my royal guard...

686
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,175
Who on earth is my royal guard?
