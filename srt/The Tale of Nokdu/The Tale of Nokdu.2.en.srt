5
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,463
- Gosh.
- It hurts!

6
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,223
Goodness. Oh, my.

7
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,521
What are you doing?

8
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,318
You pervert.

9
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,116
Come on. Goodness.

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,035
- Stop.
- Please spare me.

11
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,244
I am a human too.

12
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,080
You are no better than an animal.
How dare you run your mouth?

13
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,334
Putting on a robe does not make you
a decent human being!

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,835
"A robe"?

15
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,255
It is Vice-Curator.

16
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,381
What?

17
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,056
Have you been drinking?

18
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,059
Look at your broad shoulders.

19
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,394
Yes.

20
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,688
I met a woman of my dreams.

21
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,191
How could I not have a drink?

22
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,319
Anyway,

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,114
please tell me
where your winged dress is.

24
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,491
My goodness.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,624
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

26
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,292
The Vice-Curator...

27
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,128
often forgets when he gets drunk.

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,550
I believe
he might have lost his life.

29
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,177
He got drunk
and fell on the mountain.

30
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,055
And we happened
to find him here. Okay?

31
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,181
- Okay.
- Okay.

32
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,814
Yes.

33
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,441
I will say that too.

34
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:16,697
(The Tale of Nokdu)

35
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,995
(Episode 3)

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,669
Why are you glancing at me?

37
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,090
I know everything.

38
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,967
Know what?

39
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,430
I know why you made a huge fuss
to avoid coming into the water.

40
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,057
Well...

41
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,060
To tell you the truth, you and I...

42
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,395
are the same.

43
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,688
We are...

44
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,106
the same?

45
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,901
Even if they are small,

46
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,279
it is all right.

47
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
- Pardon?
- What matters is...

48
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,658
your heart.

49
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,119
You must not feel discouraged...

50
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,079
just because they are small. Okay?

51
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,082
You must own it. Okay?

52
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,795
Okay. My heart matters.

53
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,264
The body disappeared?

54
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,641
(I poisoned him.)

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,683
Yes.

56
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,603
When they returned to the site,
it had disappeared by then.

57
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,273
I was definitely informed
that he was dead.

58
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,444
He disguised his death
and followed the Muweol Corps.

59
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,904
Then he must already be
in the village for widows.

60
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,198
But men cannot enter the village.

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,867
He can hide in the gisaeng house
or near the village.

62
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,869
Tell them to search
the place thoroughly.

63
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,830
What about His Majesty's people
that went to the island?

64
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,000
I sent everyone to other places.
Only Muweol Corps remains.

65
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,920
So he will not be able
to find anything.

66
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,755
What about the others
who ran away from the island?

67
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,424
Widows all over the kingdom
will be looking for them.

68
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,509
It will not be long.

69
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,179
Do not miss anyone.
You must find everyone. Understood?

70
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,305
Yes.

71
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,650
He is surely fated
to live a long life.

72
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,695
Why did he show up again?

73
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,822
And why now, of all times?

74
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,409
You saw whom?

75
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,078
It was Jung Yun Jeo.
I am sure of it.

76
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,621
I recently traveled all the way...

77
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,331
to Gangryeong Harbor
for some matter.

78
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,542
I was completely shocked
when I saw him.

79
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,461
However, Yun Jeo died
during the war.

80
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,839
I know.

81
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,425
That is why I took another look.

82
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,969
I am certain. It was him.

83
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,849
Surely, you must be mistaken.

84
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,559
You must not tell this to anyone.

85
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,103
They will criticize you
for telling a lie.

86
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,400
But His Majesty seemed happy
to hear it.

87
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,489
Did you already tell His Majesty?

88
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,699
Yes.

89
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,743
Just like you were his good friend,

90
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:12,080
His Majesty was also a close friend.

91
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,232
How long will this take?

92
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,113
Are you all right?

93
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,038
As soon as we come ashore,
I will go to Hanyang.

94
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,791
- You and Master Hwang...
- No.

95
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,336
The assassins that came after you
made a trip to the mainland.

96
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,798
If you go to Hanyang, I am sure
they will chase you again.

97
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,225
Where can I find a medicine shop?

98
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,271
- Where is the medicine shop?
- Go that way.

99
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,942
Are you not Jung Yun Jeo?

100
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,821
You are mistaken.

101
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,489
This is Lim Yoo.

102
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,825
During the war, you and I...

103
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,788
I heard that you passed away
in the war. How could you be...

104
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,583
I said, you are mistaken.

105
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,007
I should have been more careful.

106
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,721
- You do not have to worry.
- Do you think...

107
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,182
you can bury the secret
you have been dreading...

108
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,808
if you bring Nok Du back?

109
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,689
Get some sleep.

110
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:15,329
I will be able to smell the dirt
from my hometown.

111
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,832
I will tell you what.

112
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,668
This place is very remote,
so if you hide well,

113
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,462
it will be hard for them
to find you.

114
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,756
Thank you, and I am sorry.

115
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,965
I am putting you
through a lot of trouble.

116
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:27,966
Gosh.

117
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,927
Why are you talking to me
like we are strangers?

118
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,679
We are going to be in-laws
in the future.

119
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,515
Is that not right?

120
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,361
So Jung Yun Jeo was not there?

121
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,112
No.

122
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,032
We searched Gangryeong Harbor
and nearby islands,

123
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,700
but we could not find him.

124
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,203
He must have been mistaken.

125
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,996
Is that so?

126
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,084
I was expecting good news
when I heard that my good friend...

127
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,545
who had died during the war
was alive.

128
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,839
How disappointing.

129
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,675
I appreciate your hard work.

130
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,830
You will sleep without changing?

131
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,707
Your clothes are all wet.

132
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,503
Then...

133
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,590
could you give me a cloth
to dry my clothes?

134
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:59,057
If you have a spare pair of pants,
could I borrow that too?

135
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,613
Could you stay in the porch
while I change?

136
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,241
You surely require
a lot of help from me.

137
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,119
I hate this kind of stuff.

138
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,122
You ought to take care of yourself.

139
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,628
Could I...

140
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,299
ask for a warm bowl...

141
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,842
of water?

142
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,642
She has no idea that I saved her.

143
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,024
That blanket is mine. This is yours.

144
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,442
Is that so?

145
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,069
Let us just switch them.

146
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,278
I do not want to.

147
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,030
Then stay outside.

148
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,658
Forget it. Let us just go to sleep.

149
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,080
You did it again!

150
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,457
What is it? What did I do again?

151
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,835
Please do not take off your clothes
without telling me first.

152
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,586
Give me some time,
so I can prepare myself.

153
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,755
Should I put up a post
on the streets first?

154
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,550
I believe changing outside
is a polite thing to do.

155
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,012
Hey, you. This is my room.

156
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,722
When you changed, I waited outside.

157
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,808
And should I go outside
when I change too?

158
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,143
Please do not touch me.

159
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,691
Excuse me, this is...

160
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,026
These are all Lady Chun's rooms.

161
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,361
It is not your room.

162
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,374
If you dislike me that much,

163
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,251
you can sleep outside.

164
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,586
If I sleep outside,

165
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,507
my mouth will get paralyzed.

166
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,191
- What do you want?
- Hey.

167
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,234
If you sleep here,
your mouth will get paralyzed.

168
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,029
I do not care. I will stay here.

169
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,114
Gosh.

170
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,078
This island is tiny to begin with.

171
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,872
Are you not sick and tired
of leaving home?

172
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,791
Go inside.
Mother will be worried about you.

173
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,251
She is worried about you too.

174
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,545
Let us go together.

175
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,175
Do you think so?

176
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,306
It is not like I ran away ashore.

177
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,850
I just got on that boat
instead of you since you were ill.

178
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,852
Did he have to get so upset?

179
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,273
Nok Du.

180
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,776
I am sure Father had his reasons.

181
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:00,113
- You know that, right?
- Then he should tell me.

182
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,949
If so, I would be able to give up
or overcome it.

183
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,451
Hey. Did you just say
that you will give up?

184
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,620
Will you give up
on becoming a general ashore?

185
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,956
Gosh. Of course, not.

186
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,837
- What?
- What is this?

187
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,963
- Nok Du.
- What is it?

188
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,130
My mouth is paralyzed.

189
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,341
Come on!

190
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,425
Your mouth will get paralyzed...

191
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,510
- if you stay here.
- I will not go home.

192
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,553
Let us go.

193
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:23,762
- I do not want to!
- Let us go.

194
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,722
- Gosh!
- What is it?

195
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,391
- Darn it!
- What is it?

196
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,725
My mouth is paralyzed too.

197
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,477
My gosh.

198
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,812
Let us go.

199
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,814
Fine. Just wait a minute.

200
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,232
I will not go then.

201
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,817
What about your mouth?

202
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,151
- Whatever.
- It will get paralyzed.

203
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,194
I will not go.

204
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,082
That is impossible.

205
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,293
I saw him collapse with my own eyes.

206
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,378
Once you take that poison,
you will die immediately.

207
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,588
Seeing how he disappeared,

208
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,631
he knew it beforehand
and was prepared.

209
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,008
Not too long ago,

210
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,217
was there not a man...

211
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,344
who tried to enter our village
and was chased away?

212
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,889
There are countless men like him.

213
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,308
It was the day
when Deul Le returned.

214
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,476
- Do you think...
- Allow me...

215
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,854
This is not a matter
you can take up alone anymore.

216
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,231
We need to all act on it.

217
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,567
We need to follow our orders.

218
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,541
If they are dead,

219
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,085
you should apologize.

220
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,670
You little...

221
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,344
As you all know,

222
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,930
the recent mission has failed
unlike all the others.

223
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,599
Why were we ordered to kill
those men who were neither...

224
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,017
corrupt officials nor aristocrats?

225
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,104
Exactly. It was unlike us
to do such a thing.

226
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,731
Who made that order?

227
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,816
That is something...

228
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,693
only the boss would know.

229
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,904
- Is that so?
- Really?

230
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,739
Only the boss knows?

231
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,324
Who is this host?

232
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,909
What is important is that...

233
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,744
one of those dogs...

234
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,163
followed us to this village.

235
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,957
I assume that jerk...

236
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,376
will try to sneak in
during the night.

237
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,044
We should patrol...

238
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,173
around the village, gisaeng house,
and all the routes.

239
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,302
Come on. The Virtuous Women Corps
is guarding the village already.

240
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,387
He is very skilled.

241
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,055
It is true that
they have volunteered...

242
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,765
to patrol the village.

243
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:14,975
But since
they are not trained fighters,

244
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,643
we need to help out.

245
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,771
Check all the areas
where one could hide.

246
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,398
Since many people come and go
from the gisaeng house,

247
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,483
keep an eye out for that place.

248
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,904
Deul Lae drew this drawing
of the wanted man.

249
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,448
- "The wanted man"?
- Remember this face.

250
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,293
Thanks in advance.
I need to see the boss.

251
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,185
What are you doing there?

252
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,187
I thought you were going
to see the boss.

253
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,565
Right. I thought
I had heard something.

254
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,400
It must have been me.

255
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,110
Do you think so?

256
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,612
All right. Good luck.

257
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,263
You...

258
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,908
This way!

259
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,765
Are you the new widow?

260
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,726
Where are you coming from?

261
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,478
It is late at night.

262
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,898
It was too noisy, so I woke up.

263
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,692
I decided to go for a walk.

264
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,110
It was noisy?

265
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,237
You see,

266
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,949
the gisaeng I am sharing a room with
has nasty sleeping habits.

267
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,704
Are you talking about Dong Joo?

268
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,207
Right, I heard her drinking habits
are far worse.

269
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:11,044
Well, I do not think we will
ever be drinking together anyway.

270
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,088
By the way,

271
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,092
why are you dressed like that?

272
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,886
Well...

273
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,472
We come here to help out
when it gets busy.

274
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,725
We make chump change.

275
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:25,809
- Right?
- Yes.

276
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,646
I should go now.

277
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,064
Goodbye.

278
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,070
I should have seen the boss's face.

279
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,414
What are you doing?

280
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,751
It is nothing.

281
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,100
Last night, a young man appeared
at the village for widows...

282
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,435
and caused chaos.

283
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,063
My, my. A young man
at that village?

284
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,565
Exactly. He must have run away
after doing something heinous.

285
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:15,609
The widows want to catch him
at all costs.

286
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:16,777
They ought to.

287
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,278
Whoever that young man is,

288
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,947
he must be one wicked man.

289
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,327
Here.

290
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,373
Hey.

291
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,662
Lady Hwa Su, who is he?

292
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,706
This must be
your first time seeing him.

293
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,875
He is Joseon's best...

294
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,001
Swordsman?

295
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,211
Pushover.

296
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,046
He is Joseon's best pushover.

297
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,506
He is Lord Yul Mu's friend.

298
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,508
And he is surprisingly loyal.

299
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,011
I have never seen
a pushover like him.

300
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,110
I thought he came to relay
His Majesty's orders or something.

301
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,614
How absurd.

302
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,788
It is sweet and cold.

303
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,873
Try some before it starts melting.

304
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,167
Here.

305
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,893
She should have at least had a bite.

306
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,772
My gosh, you startled me.

307
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,114
It really is sweet and cold.

308
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,891
My gosh, if only that punk
had not hit me.

309
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,101
Darn it.

310
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,655
I guess the only to kill him...

311
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,741
is to enter the palace.

312
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,917
If I want to catch a tiger,
I should enter its den.

313
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:05,858
Excuse...

314
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,778
I am never going to enter
the gisaeng house again.

315
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,864
The gisaeng house? Why?

316
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,992
I went there earlier
to give them some wine.

317
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,411
And an unknown man
suddenly held my hand.

318
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,204
Why? Why did he do that?

319
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,957
I got startled
and shook his hand off.

320
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,959
And he told me...

321
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,545
that he thought I was Hwa Su.

322
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,880
The head-turner?

323
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,507
The gisaeng that makes
every man's head turn?

324
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,843
The really beautiful gisaeng?

325
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,596
Is she beautiful?

326
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,015
I personally think
she looks too pale.

327
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,017
Go ahead and tell me what you think.

328
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,311
Do I really look like her?

329
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,408
Yes, you do.

330
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,285
I understand why he was mistaken.

331
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,413
My goodness,
I really do not like it.

332
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,041
What else can you do?

333
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,835
You should put up
with your stunning beauty.

334
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,547
What is going on?

335
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:14,092
This is crazy. Are you all blind?

336
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,178
What?

337
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,349
There is no need for you to worry.

338
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,398
You really do not need
to worry at all.

339
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:35,614
I am sorry that people think
you look similar...

340
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,407
to someone you utterly hate.

341
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,202
But I personally disagree.

342
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,329
Lady Hwa Su's nose
is sharp and pointy.

343
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,373
And her eyebrows are shaped
like the crescent moon.

344
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,958
But on the other hand,

345
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,751
your nose is flat and wide.

346
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,419
And your eyebrows
look like a caterpillar.

347
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,713
They are really thick,
so you look very gallant.

348
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,382
You do not look
like Lady Hwa Su at all.

349
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,051
My nose is wide and flat?

350
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,553
Yes. On top of that,

351
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,055
Lady Hwa Su's skin is very white.

352
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,348
But your skin...

353
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,809
is fairly yellow
which makes you seem masculine.

354
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,018
Do you not agree?

355
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,021
My skin is yellow?

356
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,147
Hey!

357
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,817
Who are you?

358
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,570
Are you here as a judge
or something?

359
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,531
Oh, right. Well...

360
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,241
I guess I should have
introduced myself first.

361
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,409
I am a member of the Kim family
from Hanyang...

362
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,244
I do not care about your name.

363
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,579
What a joke.

364
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,455
How dare you call my nose
flat and wide?

365
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:29,084
You look like a weasel
that got drenched in water.

366
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,296
A weasel!

367
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,382
"A weasel"?

368
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:36,967
Are you serious?

369
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,136
What? You judged me first.

370
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,929
Am I not allowed to do that?

371
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,057
Oh, my goodness!

372
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,726
- I will kill you.
- What is wrong with you?

373
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,687
- Then I will kill myself too.
- My goodness.

374
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,397
You little weasel!

375
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,482
My goodness, that is enough.

376
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,109
Get out of my way!

377
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,570
My goodness, that is hot!

378
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,281
My gosh, my hands!

379
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,742
- Are you okay?
- Stop it!

380
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:07,539
My goodness!

381
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,374
Gosh, my bottom!

382
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,627
My gosh, that hurts!

383
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,962
Gosh, my hands are burning.

384
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,341
My goodness. Oh, gosh.

385
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,849
That hurts so much.

386
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,726
My gosh.

387
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,489
Oh, dear me.

388
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,215
The rain is pouring like crazy.

389
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,847
It is just like the day...

390
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,641
Yun Jeo died.

391
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:52,686
Go.

392
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,859
I will report that you buried
the dead baby...

393
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:03,238
and that I stabbed you,
and you fell into the river.

394
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,991
So live as if you do not exist.

395
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,619
Live like you are dead.

396
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,802
(Inn)

397
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,792
I must see Yun.

398
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,883
The more I think about it,
the more absurd this is.

399
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,803
I only helped her out
because she was concerned.

400
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,471
I wonder...

401
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,557
if that was really helpful.

402
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,935
I mean she said she did not like
that she resembled the gisaeng.

403
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,478
So I told her she did not look
like the gisaeng.

404
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,480
I was being honest.

405
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:21,942
Ma'am.

406
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,862
- You do not have friends, do you?
- What?

407
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,363
I am sure you only had assistants...

408
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,532
because you were
from a noble family.

409
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,953
Should I tell you
what you should do...

410
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,621
in a situation like that?

411
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:38,750
Yes.

412
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,215
Without nothing in return?

413
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,508
Pardon?

414
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,434
Listen.

415
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,978
"My goodness, really?"

416
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,980
"No way."

417
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:04,401
- What do you mean?
- Do not be logical about it.

418
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,111
"Oh, my. Really?"

419
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:09,198
"You look just like her. Goodness."

420
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,950
You just need to say these sentences
at appropriate times.

421
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,914
I do not follow you at all.

422
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,419
You know,

423
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,087
it is embarrassing to bring
some things up yourself...

424
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,464
and you want other people
to bring it up on your behalf.

425
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,174
You know what I mean?

426
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,676
All you need to do
is just play along.

427
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:34,264
You are a woman too.
How could you not get that?

428
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,683
My goodness. Unbelievable.

429
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,352
What? I am not done yet.

430
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,854
Wait, wait. Before you go,
can you help me with this?

431
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:41,939
Gosh.

432
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:43,899
There are some places...

433
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:45,484
you must not
take your clothes off at.

434
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,903
What is wrong with here?

435
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,613
You should change on your own
after unwrapping your bandages.

436
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,365
I cannot help you with that.

437
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,548
Ma'am.

438
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:08,715
What is it?

439
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:12,010
I cannot sleep without a pillow.

440
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,480
Do you not think
you are being too harsh?

441
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,315
I am in need of your help.

442
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,444
You surely require
a lot of help from me.

443
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,238
I hate this kind of stuff.

444
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,950
You ought to take care of yourself.

445
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:36,869
Okay.

446
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,997
This is it. I will not ask
any more help from you.

447
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:47,171
What am I doing?

448
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:48,589
Forget about befriending her.

449
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,465
I will be her enemy at this rate.

450
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,471
"My goodness, really? No way."

451
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,434
I cannot believe it.

452
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,481
You startled me.

453
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:08,734
What are you doing?

454
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,573
You again.

455
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,409
It is itchy
because I cannot change my clothes.

456
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,171
Not there.

457
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:31,924
What did you say?

458
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:35,511
To the side...

459
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,429
Speak louder.

460
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,099
Gosh. Well, move to the right more.

461
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,352
Scratch it harder.

462
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,103
Yes, that is it.

463
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,522
That is the spot.

464
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:49,107
A bit more to the right. A bit more.

465
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,610
Move down a bit. Just a bit.

466
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,321
Yes, that hits the spot.

467
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,198
Go down a bit.

468
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:58,742
That feels nice. Gosh, it is nice.

469
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,411
Go down a bit more.

470
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,475
Why did she stop
in the middle of it?

471
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,033
Oh, it hurts.

472
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,889
Oh, right. She got burnt too.

473
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,390
That must hurt.

474
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,562
Ma'am.

475
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,776
Right. She must be tired too.

476
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:38,509
Goodness!

477
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,678
This is an unpardonable act!

478
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:44,431
How dare you do something
only thugs would do?

479
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,683
Are you not scared
to face the deity?

480
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,976
I was just trying to...

481
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,770
You got burnt too.

482
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:50,938
So I was going
to put some herbs on it.

483
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,731
I thought your bottom must hurt too.

484
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,817
My bottom? Herbs?

485
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,736
How could a woman...

486
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,405
do that to another woman?

487
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,119
What is this?

488
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,122
I cannot believe this.

489
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:15,420
This is unfair.

490
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,173
Why do you feel this is unfair?

491
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,259
"Here comes the general."

492
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,804
You should have said that
before you played your move.

493
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,723
Right. I have forgotten.

494
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:28,517
Okay.
This round will not count either.

495
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,726
Let us play again.

496
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,270
It is getting late.

497
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,480
Will you not be going back
to the palace now?

498
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,941
The night is still young.

499
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:38,569
Do you still have problems...

500
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:41,989
going to sleep, Your Majesty?

501
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,741
Yes.

502
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,579
So I ask that at least
you do not kick me out.

503
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,163
How could I?

504
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,875
Please do not say that.

505
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,336
When it came to janggi,

506
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,423
Yun Jeo was very good at it.

507
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:07,222
I begged him to give me
one more chance to change my move,

508
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,099
but he did not even bat an eye.

509
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,393
He was indeed determined.

510
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,732
Yes, he was.

511
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,485
The day when Yun Jeo died...

512
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,322
You said...

513
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,950
Yun Jeo died after
he had buried the baby, correct?

514
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,370
Yes.

515
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,539
He definitely did, Your Majesty.

516
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,707
And you...

517
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,252
killed Yun Jeo, correct?

518
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:44,593
Okay.

520
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,013
I have already heard this from you.

521
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,890
I am asking useless questions.

522
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,184
I am sure what you say is true...

523
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,478
and you will never deceive me.

524
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,776
Let us resume after a short break.

525
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,153
I am tired.

526
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,469
No matter how much I think about it,

527
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,681
I think the local functionary
told the truth.

528
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,393
Look into Jung Yun Jeo's whereabouts
a bit more.

529
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,521
Yes, Your Majesty.

530
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:27,613
"Oh, my! Are you serious?
I cannot believe that!"

531
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:30,574
"My goodness, really?"

532
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:31,825
"No way..."

533
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,490
Wait.

534
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:19,915
My lady!

535
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:29,424
My lady.

536
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,094
I heard you got burnt.

537
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,805
- I did.
- Dear me.

538
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,517
Take this.

539
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,812
Oh, it is for treating such wounds.

540
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:45,399
I fell on the mountain
a few days ago.

541
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,359
I visited a physician
and was prescribed this.

542
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:49,319
It is a salve.

543
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,530
I see.

544
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,413
Thank you.

545
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:01,206
My dear.

546
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,511
Why did you have to have feelings
for me of all people?

547
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:17,097
Where is your burn?

548
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,016
Let me put that salve on you.

549
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:21,476
It is here.

550
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,312
No, not there!

551
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,403
You are so filthy-minded.

552
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:37,451
No, my lady. I am not filthy-minded.

553
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,579
My wounds have not yet healed!

554
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:54,801
It is best to stay away
from her sight.

555
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,512
It is me.

556
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,933
What are you doing?

557
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,185
How were you going to wash
your clothes with those hands?

558
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:48,272
Come on, they are almost
all healed up.

559
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,481
Let me do it.

560
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:52,693
If you are not careful,
you will only worsen it!

561
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,874
I told you to stay away
from my bottom!

562
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:08,333
I told you that I am fine!

563
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,836
Gosh, sit on this.

564
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,838
If you are not careful,
you will only worsen it.

565
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:26,977
You are good at washing
the clothes...

566
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,645
for someone from a noble family.

567
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:32,274
This is the first and last time
I will be helping you.

568
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,359
I know you are just saying that.

569
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,944
I bet you will help me out
next time as well.

570
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,446
Do not be ridiculous.

571
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,907
If your burns worsen, it will
only cause me a headache.

572
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,409
I am doing this reluctantly.

573
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:45,454
Gosh.

574
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:05,599
When did you visit a physician?

575
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,643
Physician, my foot.

576
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,520
I just found it.

577
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:10,896
Fine.

578
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,943
It is not too bad.

579
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:17,611
What do you mean?

580
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,364
To have someone care for you.

581
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,366
It makes me reminisce
about the old days.

582
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:28,121
You will never be able
to find someone...

583
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:31,041
who takes care of you this well.

584
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,460
I am pretty much like your mother.

585
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:36,505
You are right.

586
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:41,760
It seems like...

587
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,430
your mother must have been
a very nice person.

588
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,934
Yes, she was.

589
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,435
Very much so.

590
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:53,939
How jealous.

591
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,525
You must have
many great memories with her.

592
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,697
It pains me that I do.

593
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:05,200
Such memories keep popping up.

594
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,416
How was your mother?

595
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:19,840
My mother?

596
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:22,467
Mother.

597
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,304
Father will be here soon
with medicine.

598
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:26,847
So please hang in there.

599
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,017
My son.

600
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:35,147
Yes, Mother. I am here.

601
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:38,483
I am sorry
that you have to live this way.

602
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,528
You are such a precious son,

603
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,072
yet I have made you like this.

604
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:49,203
I am truly sorry about that.

605
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:51,872
What?

606
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:54,291
Listen to me carefully.

607
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,127
Your name is not...

608
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,297
Hwang Tae.

609
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:02,549
You are Jung...

610
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:05,552
Yi...

611
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:10,891
Mother.

612
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:12,309
Mother.

613
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:13,602
Hwang Tae!

614
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:15,562
Come on in here!

615
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:17,356
Mother.

616
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,568
It is all your fault.

617
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,612
Had it not been for you,

618
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:27,491
my son would have...

619
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,327
My family would have...

620
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:32,037
Mother.

621
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,125
Mother.

622
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,337
Mother.

623
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:42,798
Mother!

624
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,973
She was a good mother.

625
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,934
She was pitiable,
and I felt sorry for her.

626
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:00,399
Right, are you okay?

627
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,734
Should I apply some of this
on your bottom?

628
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:05,487
My goodness.

629
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,281
Wait.

630
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:08,782
What is it?

631
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,542
Can I treat you
like an older sister?

632
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:53,035
If it is okay with you, of course.

633
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:59,166
What is it? Do you not want me to?

634
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,126
No.

635
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:02,586
What?

636
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:08,008
Because I am not older than you.

637
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:09,468
Well...

638
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:12,221
I was born in the Year of the Ram.

639
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:13,555
Are you younger than me?

640
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,517
I thought she memorized...

641
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,393
Confucian texts
in the Year of the Snake...

642
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,562
Year of the Snake, was it?

643
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:22,397
On that year, I mastered
the "Thousand-Character Classic"...

644
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:23,315
and memorized Confucian texts.

645
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:24,525
So what?

646
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:30,531
Well, I mean...

647
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:33,825
It is not like I feel obligated...

648
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,495
to treat you like an older sister.

649
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,373
I should get going now.
I am a little busy.

650
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,507
My gosh, what a funny lady.

651
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,717
I am busy too.

652
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,600
Have I gone nuts?
What is wrong with me?

653
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:00,727
I wonder if she saw me blush.

654
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:02,896
So what if she saw me?

655
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,774
Why did she have to say she wanted
to treat me like an older sister?

656
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:06,942
Darn it.

657
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:30,465
Ma'am.

658
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,012
What in the world...

659
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,494
The shaman over there...

660
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,372
is praying to the skies
to console all the widows...

661
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:04,208
that had to face wrongful deaths.

662
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,710
Something bad could happen
if you walk around like this.

663
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:08,629
Something bad? Like what?

664
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:12,424
Souls that bear deep resentment
are roaming around the village.

665
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,384
So we must keep our doors closed...

666
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,512
- and turn all the lights off.
- What?

667
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,430
You should follow me to my house.

668
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,391
Some widows
who ignored the warning...

669
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:23,352
ended up disappearing.

670
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:24,478
So you cannot...

671
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,271
What? Hey!

672
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:28,398
Lady Kim!

673
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,465
A man?

674
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,361
What? What happened?

675
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,657
A drunkard did this to me.

676
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:25,659
My gosh, you stink.

677
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:27,744
I will get you some new clothes.

678
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,912
You should wash up.

679
00:55:29,872 --> 00:55:31,081
You are the best.

680
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:32,457
My gosh, what are you doing?

681
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,750
You are dirtying my clothes too.

682
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,669
I want to wear my favorite one.
The jade green jacket.

683
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,337
Just wear whatever I give you.

684
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:02,256
Gosh, that hurts.

685
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:05,676
Lady Kim.

686
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:09,346
My gosh, you startled me.

687
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:12,641
I thought a perverted jerk
was peeping through the hole.

688
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:13,725
What?

689
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:15,519
I am not a perverted jerk.

690
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:19,147
What brings you here?

691
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:21,149
I thought you were busy.

692
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:23,110
Make sure you keep it quiet.

693
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:25,195
I do not want you
to disturb the guests.

694
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:26,488
Yes, ma'am.

695
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,871
Hey, I asked you why you are here.

696
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:35,914
What? Well...

697
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,750
I was looking
for a pair of scissors.

698
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:41,336
And someone told me that I could
find them in the dressing room.

699
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,379
Why do you need a pair of scissors?

700
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,715
Then you should have
just come inside.

701
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,758
- Why did you make a hole...
- Because...

702
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,802
- Well...
- What do you want?

703
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:57,394
I wanted to cut your hair.

704
00:57:58,478 --> 00:57:59,980
Why do you want to cut my hair?

705
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,315
It made me feel really bad...

706
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:02,482
to see you look so shabby.

707
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,692
Close your eyes.

708
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:05,402
Why do you want me
to close my eyes?

709
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:08,071
Your hair might go inside.

710
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:10,032
My gosh, what was that for?

711
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:12,451
Why did you poke my eyes?

712
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,661
My gosh, that hurts.

713
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:17,039
My goodness, seriously.

714
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:52,449
- Is he...
- Yes, I think he is hiding here.

715
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:27,484
Just make it look even.

716
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,444
You do not need
to put too much thought into it.

717
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,323
I am cutting the hair
of a precious lady.

718
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,409
I should put in
a lot of care into it.

719
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,579
If you think I am so precious,

720
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:39,663
why did you pull a straight face...

721
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:41,290
when I asked you
if we could be sisters?

722
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,671
Something is on your chin.

723
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:48,714
My gosh!

724
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,383
My gosh, that hurts.

725
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,135
Am I bleeding?

726
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:55,345
Look. My gosh.

727
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:58,265
My gosh, no!

728
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:01,727
Well...

729
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:04,438
What was that?

730
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:08,358
You do not need to look
in the mirror.

731
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,445
You are acting odd.

732
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:13,488
Please hand me that.

733
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:14,781
No.

734
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:17,492
What? This is odd.

735
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,536
- Hand that to me.
- No.

736
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,747
- I need to take a look.
- No.

737
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:24,082
Give it to me.

738
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,251
- Just give that to me.
- No.

739
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:27,836
Goodness.

740
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,421
No.

741
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:50,127
Gosh.

742
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:51,712
Oh, my.

743
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:20,991
(The Tale of Nokdu)

744
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:25,495
I was going to the bathroom.

745
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:26,955
I will go back inside.

746
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,208
How lovely.

747
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,418
What are you doing here?

748
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:33,712
I told you to stay here!

749
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,380
Stay right there. You cannot go out.

750
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:36,423
Stay by my side.

751
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:37,758
Dong Joo?

752
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,676
I heard that she well passed
the time to have her ceremony.

753
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,678
She is only of age,
but she has not...

754
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:44,389
You do not make the choice. I do.

755
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,517
Dong Joo. Dong Joo.

756
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:49,520
How much of it did you hear?

757
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:51,522
You mean
how you plan to kill someone?

758
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,398
You heard us correctly.
