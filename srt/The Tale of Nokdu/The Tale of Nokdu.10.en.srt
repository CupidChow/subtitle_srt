(Episode 19)

6
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,623
Well, you are not my family.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,834
But you can pretend to be my family
and come see me.

8
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,044
I cannot do that to you...

9
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,464
no matter how awful I am.

10
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,845
First place
of military service exam.

11
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,930
Yeon Soo.

12
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,723
Congratulations.

13
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,033
Do you think you will not pay...

14
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,078
for what you have done to me?

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,959
Will you not accept the certificate?

16
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,467
This is all because of you.

17
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,303
This is all because...

18
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,388
you are the son...

19
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,515
of His Majesty.

20
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,231
Will you accept this certificate
from me?

21
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,336
Are you all right?

22
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,963
I heard that you almost got hurt
from the gambling house.

23
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,549
I am sorry. I feel like
I am responsible for it.

24
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,093
No, you are not.
I went there on my own will.

25
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,348
How about looking for a way
to become a court lady?

26
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,641
You are pretty.

27
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,227
Pardon? Court lady?

28
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,062
Well, why not?

29
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,609
When His Majesty comes out
in disguise, approach him...

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,944
and win him over.

31
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,112
That way, you will be able
to enter the palace right away.

32
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,740
He comes out in disguise?

33
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,909
Yes. He says he comes out
in disguise,

34
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,494
but everyone at the palace
knows that.

35
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,663
He often goes out at night.

36
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,770
Please go in. He is waiting for you.

37
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,817
Are you not curious...

38
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,403
what I told...

39
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,655
His Majesty in there?

40
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,074
Yeon Soo.

41
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,870
Did you come here
with the vice-curator?

42
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,914
With the girl and the drunkard too?

43
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,458
- You...
- Take...

44
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,671
as much time as you want.

45
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,136
Were you that surprised?

46
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,182
Pardon?

47
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,893
I ask because you have been
only staring at me...

48
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,729
since you came in
and did not say a word to me.

49
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,191
I am sorry.

50
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,859
I mean,

51
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,779
my apologies for not knowing
the rules of the palace.

52
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,910
I am not used to the rules here.

53
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,374
I get to laugh thanks to you.

54
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,210
There is no need for that.

55
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,713
Rules are not necessary
between you and me.

56
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,384
Right.

57
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,389
Is that so?

58
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,532
Of course.

59
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:42,950
Under one condition.

60
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,286
You must pretend not to know
about my night outing.

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,540
Please keep it a secret
to your lady as well.

62
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,458
What do you say?

63
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,254
I will comply.

64
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,760
I will assign you to
Chief Administrative Officer Baek...

65
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,428
whom you have met the other day.

66
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,098
You will help him with his tasks.

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,977
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,034
Open it.

69
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,119
Here.

70
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,210
Here.

71
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,798
My gosh. This is no way
to treat your guest.

72
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,883
Guest?

73
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,468
I did not know
guests brought swords.

74
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,553
You know?

75
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,597
I am a guest...

76
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,307
as long as you do not cause trouble.

77
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,433
What?

78
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,810
You are the one who barged
into our house, making a fuss.

79
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,104
Have you already forgotten?

80
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,556
Why are you fighting
when I am having a meal here?

81
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,141
You will chase away my appetite.

82
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,143
Goodness.

83
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,150
She is right. Stop it.

84
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,070
You will spoil our happy reunion.

85
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,657
You little brat.

86
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,825
Come over here. You brat.

87
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,081
I do not want to harm you.

88
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,291
- Not yet, at least.
- "Not yet"?

89
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,710
You are unbelievable.

90
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,638
It is because of me.

91
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,974
He found me when I went
to the palace gate to wait for you.

92
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,143
No, it is all right. He would have
probably tailed me anyway.

93
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,689
Come with me.

94
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,871
So you are still alive,
which is unfortunate.

95
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,205
Thanks to you.

96
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,543
By the way, why did you
suddenly get a job at the palace?

97
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,836
To be successful.

98
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,838
I need to make a living,

99
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,632
and as you know, I am
very talented in martial arts.

100
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,511
What about you?
What are you getting at?

101
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,348
I have never been stabbed
by a sword before.

102
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,852
I thought I would die
when I passed out.

103
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,104
When I gave it some thought
after waking up,

104
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,440
I thought it would be a shame...

105
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,860
if I kill you
with that simple method.

106
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,987
This is between you and me.

107
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,198
Do not get others involved in this.
If you do...

108
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,240
Why not?

109
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,577
Will you tell His Majesty
that I am planning treason?

110
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,913
Do you think I cannot?

111
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,166
I will bring you
and your great family down.

112
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,751
I doubt you can.

113
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,880
Your brother is planning the treason
with me.

114
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,340
What?

115
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,552
Do not look at me that way.

116
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,180
He came back to me willingly.

117
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,974
Unlike you,

118
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,311
he is greedy and ambitious...

119
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,646
just like me.

120
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,980
You scumbag.

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,950
What are you doing?

122
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,953
Be careful. You will get hurt.

123
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,872
Are you okay? Are you injured?

124
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,594
If you do not want him to die,
follow me.

125
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,763
What is this lunatic saying?

126
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,223
Is that a threat?

127
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,474
Think however you like,

128
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,934
but I will not allow you
to stay here.

129
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:19,935
Go.

130
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,603
Go inside your room.

131
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,911
I will bring my belongings,

132
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,413
so wait.

133
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,800
Are you...

134
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,469
very upset with her?

135
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,682
No.

136
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,894
I have given up on her.

137
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,228
Sorry?

138
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,690
I had been letting her
do whatever she wanted...

139
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,109
because I realized...

140
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,696
that she was hanging on
with the strength that she had.

141
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,532
But then, a guy appeared,

142
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,911
and she is swayed by him.

143
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,997
I cannot take it anymore
and have decided to give up...

144
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,291
winning her heart.

145
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,877
Then why did you tell her to come?

146
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,421
I will have her.

147
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,049
Even if she does not like me,

148
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,093
I will keep her beside me forever.

149
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,015
I will fulfill a wish of hers,

150
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,768
so I believe I have the right.

151
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,604
Then why have you spared him?

152
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,273
- He is dangerous.
- You are correct.

153
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,026
But seeing how he and the King...

154
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,195
could not recognize each other...

155
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,907
made it quite fascinating.

156
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,578
The King who kills his son twice.

157
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,416
That will be enough
to justify our revolt.

158
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,546
He will die...

159
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,464
in his father's hands.

160
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,637
There is no other way.

161
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,639
Are you going to kill him?

162
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,851
If you do, you will have to flee
for killing a royal family member.

163
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,936
Will you abandon Aeng Du
and her father?

164
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,646
Or will you bring them along?

165
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,730
But why are you leaving?

166
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,816
Because that will keep
everyone else safe.

167
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,442
And...

168
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,030
I do not care about him.

169
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,076
So do not fight him.

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,412
I do not want to see you get hurt.

171
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,800
I am just temporarily moving out.

172
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,720
Goodbye. Do not see me out.

173
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,941
That is enough!

174
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,819
You want him
to take his father's place?

175
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,907
I have no desire to make Nok Du
do such a heinous deed.

176
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,702
And you have no right
to dethrone the King.

177
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,125
(Royal Command)

178
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,674
My lord.

179
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,231
Everyone is siding with him.

180
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,067
He will make his move soon.

181
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,236
What will you do?

182
00:12:58,904 --> 00:12:59,988
I will become...

183
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:04,952
a king who will exercise
his absolute authority.

184
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,538
He wiped out a village
full of women...

185
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,456
as he pleased.

186
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,252
Lady Chun was on his side,
but he killed her with no regrets.

187
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,881
Grand Prince Neungyang...

188
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,051
should never take the throne.

189
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,993
The guards will stop you.
Let me accompany you.

190
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,870
Stay.

191
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,873
If anything happens to me,

192
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,794
please do what I have said to you.

193
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,048
Yes, my lord.

194
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,968
Please be safe.

195
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,523
You may not leave.

196
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:17,816
This is a royal command.

197
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,026
Move aside.

198
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,153
I must speak with His Majesty.

199
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,529
Please stop.

200
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,573
I will relay your message.

201
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,782
Move aside!

202
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,494
I have served the King
twice as long as you did.

203
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,290
I am doing this to protect him.

204
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,292
So move aside.

205
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,091
Please wait while I bring out
the palanquin.

206
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,021
Eat.

207
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,153
On that day when
the village for widows was attacked,

208
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,697
did you rescue me, right?

209
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,117
I did although you returned.

210
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,411
How did you get through...

211
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,580
all those thugs?

212
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,208
I have enough power to do that.

213
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,711
Or perhaps, you had enough power
to scheme such a thing.

214
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,630
I had no choice.

215
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,344
Is this who you truly are?

216
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,514
Are you someone who threatens
people by taking hostages...

217
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,058
and kills innocent women?

218
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,770
So?

219
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,898
Were you disappointed?

220
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,068
You were never curious...

221
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,029
about who I was or what I did.

222
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,491
That is not important.

223
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,909
It was for me.

224
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,370
It was the most important.

225
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,415
Then why are you treating me
this way?

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,501
Because money could not
win you over.

227
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,713
No matter how much I tried,
you never accepted my feelings.

228
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,965
I resorted to another way,
so just stay put and...

229
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,050
I have told you clearly.

230
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,887
I left that house,

231
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,182
but I have no plans
to stay obedient under this roof.

232
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,351
So if that is what you want,

233
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,896
you may as well kill me.

234
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,857
That is the quickest solution.

235
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,933
I must meet with the Queen.

236
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,526
I heard you were locked up.

237
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,195
What is going on?

238
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,324
And what do you need to tell me
so urgently?

239
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,994
You have kept that with you
all along.

240
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,255
(20 years ago)

241
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,177
Please bury this alongside my son.

242
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:46,775
Yes.

243
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,736
I asked you for that favor...

244
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,782
because I was going to keep this
with me at all times.

245
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,954
I lost him
before I could even feed him.

246
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,500
This gives me comfort.

247
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,922
Come to think of it,

248
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,467
I never got to ask you this.

249
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,637
Did he safely get buried?

250
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,639
Your Majesty.

251
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,058
I have something to tell...

252
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,573
What are you doing here, Chancellor?

253
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,749
He says he comes out in disguise,

254
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,501
but everyone at the palace
knows that.

255
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,669
He often goes out at night.

256
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,129
He comes out in disguise?

257
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,843
I might be able to kill him
without even entering the palace.

258
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,058
Or I might die instead.

259
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,605
Boss, are you okay?

260
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,274
Do I look okay to you?

261
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,820
I am going to catch those jerks...

262
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,906
and teach them a lesson.

263
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,408
- Darn it!
- Gosh, walk slowly.

264
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,202
Be gentle.

265
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,120
Those darn jerks.

266
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,581
Hey, walk slowly.

267
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,874
Be gentle.

268
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,126
Those darn punks.

269
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,746
Are you here to see me?

270
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,415
No.

271
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,709
I dropped by while I was passing by.

272
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,466
I wish you good luck
with your new job.

273
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,136
What about you?

274
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,139
- Are you okay?
- Of course, I am okay.

275
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,057
I get to live in a huge house.

276
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,185
And as you can see,
I am allowed to go wherever I want.

277
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,064
So do not worry
and just focus on doing well.

278
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,904
What is it?

279
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,948
Do you also think
I look very handsome?

280
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:41,950
I already know.

281
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,411
You really have no sense of shame.

282
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,871
You do not look handsome,

283
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,290
but you do look like a rookie
who has just became an officer.

284
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,127
Go on inside.

285
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:58,133
I ordered you
not to leave your house.

286
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,385
I apologize, Your Majesty.

287
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,348
But there is something
I need to tell you.

288
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,017
I heard you told the guard...

289
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,936
that you are trying to protect me.

290
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,812
Yes, that is correct.

291
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,397
Tell me.

292
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,024
What are you
trying to protect me from?

293
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,609
And how are you going to do that?

294
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,322
I am aware of a man
who is getting ready to betray you.

295
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:24,910
Who is that?

296
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,122
It is Grand Prince Neungyang.

297
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,834
He is doing so many evil things...

298
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,419
to steal the throne from you.

299
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,546
What did you say?

300
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:37,881
Grand Prince Neungyang?

301
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,133
You must arrest him
and punish him right now.

302
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,135
And as soon as you are done
punishing him,

303
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,346
I also ask you to kill me...

304
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,348
for being disloyal.

305
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,572
You sounded so sincere...

306
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,534
that I almost believed you.

307
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,685
Repeat what you just said.

308
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,606
What did you just say to me?

309
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,609
Your son who was born...

310
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,611
20 years ago...

311
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,907
is still alive, Your Majesty.

312
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,660
What? He is alive?

313
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,875
How did you find out?

314
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,672
I met that man by coincidence...

315
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,051
and ended up
hearing about some things...

316
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,970
I should not have found out.

317
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,398
He is...

318
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,902
the eldest son of Jung Yun Jeo...

319
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,905
and a living witness.

320
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,909
My so-called brother...

321
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,119
is your son, Your Majesty.

322
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,121
My father...

323
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,332
raised him as his son.

324
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:40,087
How do you expect me
to believe that?

325
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,589
Please forgive us!

326
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,301
What?

327
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,638
There is another man
who is aware of this.

328
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,224
Who is that?

329
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,561
It is Heo Yun,

330
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,272
the chancellor.

331
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,860
He has been blackmailing me.

332
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,112
He told me that he will frame me
as a traitor...

333
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,490
if I did not keep my mouth shut.

334
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,119
However, I could not do that.

335
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,581
I could not dare
to deceive you, Your Majesty.

336
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,100
Your Majesty.

337
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,312
You must not get fooled by him.

338
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,941
Then...

339
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,569
who am I supposed to trust?

340
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,321
You?

341
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,574
You were my closest friend
and most loyal servant.

342
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,868
But how can I trust you
when you have been lying to me?

343
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,288
Do you know how much I wished
that I would be wrong?

344
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,248
As I was constantly
suspicious of you,

345
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,125
I still hoped that I would be wrong!

346
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:05,005
Do you have any idea how much
I hoped that I was mistaken?

347
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,468
Please kill me, Your Majesty.

348
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,096
But Your Majesty,
you still cannot...

349
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,475
trust the words
of Grand Prince Neungyang.

350
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,936
That is enough!

351
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:24,858
I want you...

352
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,612
to quietly take him to the dungeon.

353
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:33,408
Your Majesty, you can punish me
all you want!

354
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:37,162
But you must not trust
Grand Prince Neungyang!

355
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,789
Your Majesty!

356
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,832
Your Majesty!

357
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,710
You must not trust him!

358
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,754
Your Majesty!

359
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:47,756
Your Majesty!

360
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,843
Do not let him fool you!

361
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,428
Your Majesty!

362
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,347
Your Majesty!

363
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,438
I am Yeon Soo, the newly appointed
chief administrative officer.

364
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,149
I heard you came to the palace,

365
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,860
- so I thought...
- I already heard about you.

366
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,822
His Majesty has given orders
to urgently arrest someone.

367
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,073
Follow me.

368
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:14,783
Okay.

369
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,036
The evidence is loud and clear.

370
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,330
What is the point of meeting him
at this point?

371
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,040
The guards will be outside,

372
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,126
and it will be hard for you
to even meet him.

373
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,295
But I should still give it a try.

374
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,213
I need to hear
two sides of the story.

375
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:30,507
Then let us go together.

376
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,217
- Okay.
- I prefer to go alone.

377
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,094
I will not be late.

378
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:37,764
That brat.

379
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,732
No one can find out about the man
we are about to arrest.

380
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:50,027
So we need to make sure
not to cause a scene.

381
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,085
- You must escape.
- What is the matter?

382
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,670
Arrest him right now!

383
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:09,671
This is the royal command!

384
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,465
Run toward the backdoor.

385
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,925
I will be right behind you.

386
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,559
You should go.

387
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,567
Where is my father?

388
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,947
Lord Heo asked me
to give this to you.

389
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,157
He said that you would need this
to prove who you are.

390
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:29,102
That way!

391
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,438
Go!

392
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,025
Are you all right?

393
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,904
The person who saved Jung Yun Jeo
was definitely a woman.

394
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,290
I said I can go by myself. Goodness.

395
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,334
You are injured.
How could I let you?

396
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,421
Wait here.

397
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,465
It will not take long.

398
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,425
Yes, I will wait.

399
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:04,847
See you soon.

400
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:23,782
You missed him?

401
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:26,034
How could you fail to catch him?

402
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,997
Please forgive me.
I will find him at all costs.

403
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,834
Did you find anything else?

404
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,463
I found this from Lord Heo's room.

405
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,674
This document explains it.

406
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,408
Make sure you find Jung Yun Jeo.

407
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:10,078
I give you permission
to kill him if necessary.

408
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,124
You just need to bring
his corpse to me.

409
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:16,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:20,964
Open the gate.

411
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:51,286
How long have you been
plotting treason?

412
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,664
Your Majesty.

413
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,708
Was it 20 years ago...

414
00:31:56,917 --> 00:32:00,420
when you lied to me that
you had killed Yun Jeo and that boy?

415
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,214
Or...

416
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,180
was it when you hid the document
from the former king?

417
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:12,891
I told you...

418
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,185
to bring the document
if you found it.

419
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,104
However, you told me right away...

420
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,481
that the document was burnt.

421
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,026
Was this your agenda?

422
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,195
Were you trying to dethrone me...

423
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,073
and give the throne to someone
who is more legitimate than me?

424
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,076
Your Majesty.

425
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,244
You must have thought...

426
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,579
that I did not have
the right to the throne...

427
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,247
just like everyone else.

428
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,000
That is why
you decided to abandon me...

429
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,295
to serve under a new king.

430
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:55,142
I deserve death, Your Majesty.

431
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:57,936
Your Majesty.

432
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,731
You can punish me all you want,

433
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,192
but you cannot trust
Grand Prince Neungyang...

434
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,943
no matter what.

435
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,695
He is...

436
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,030
Grand Prince Neungyang?

437
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,490
Are you still talking about him?

438
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,451
Fine. Go ahead!

439
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,746
Tell me how
he is trying to plot treason.

440
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,213
I managed to escort your family
as I was worried...

441
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,256
the royal guards
might take them away.

442
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,967
As long as you stay silent,

443
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,303
I promise I will spare them.

444
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:37,184
If you end this mess
by taking full responsibility,

445
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,811
your family might have a chance...

446
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,856
to live their lives comfortably.

447
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,741
This is all
Grand Prince Neungyang's doing?

448
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,159
Yes.

449
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,620
He was framed for treason
when he entered the palace...

450
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:59,414
because of a long story
between him and His Majesty.

451
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,251
Then, is Grand Prince Neungyang...

452
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,878
behind Lady Min's death?

453
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,006
Grand Prince Neungyang told me
the same thing.

454
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,300
He told me that Lord Heo
was behind all of this.

455
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,680
Whose story must we believe?

456
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:17,015
Please think long and hard
how Grand Prince Neungyang...

457
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,559
inserted himself into this mess.

458
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,563
He is cruel and meticulous.

459
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,327
There is only one place for him
to spend his night in secret...

460
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,704
during his outing in disguise.

461
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,914
It is the best gisaeng house
in Hanyang.

462
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,958
The gisaeng house is at the foot
of Mount Okmyuk.

463
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:52,926
- Pour me a drink.
- Thank you.

464
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,219
- I would like a drink too.
- Sure.

465
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:56,972
Yes. I ought to pour you a drink.

466
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:00,976
Your Majesty, could you take me
to the palace...

467
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,227
and make me your queen?

468
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,812
Be quiet.

469
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,690
Lower your voice.

470
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,822
All right. Chief State Councillor.
Have a drink.

471
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,533
You too. You ought
to have a drink as well.

472
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:40,390
You told me you do not like me.

473
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:43,977
Okay, I get that. But you see,

474
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,438
I am going to make you like me.

475
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,381
Goodness!

476
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,342
- Your Majesty.
- My queen!

477
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:59,678
If you will not listen to me,

478
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,555
I will go to that king.

479
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,390
Okay, then.

480
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:06,101
I am a better king than he is.

481
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:09,313
What are you talking about?
You are drunk.

482
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:20,949
Nok Du.

483
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,492
Nok Du!

484
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,828
Make sure you find Jung Yun Jeo.

485
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,330
I give you permission...

486
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:28,957
to kill him if necessary.

487
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,668
You just need to bring
his corpse to me.

488
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,145
Are you looking for this?

489
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,500
She is the Queen.
Do show your respect.

490
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,341
I apologize, Your Highness.

491
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,927
I am...

492
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,137
a chief administrative officer
at the police bureau.

493
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,641
I had visited the palace
and lost it.

494
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,643
But you seem...

495
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,272
to be lost.

496
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,190
Sorry?

497
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:40,696
I am...

498
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:43,490
not familiar with the palace yet.

499
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,413
Take this.

500
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:52,040
I know my way around this place.

501
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,172
Thank you, Your Highness.

502
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:28,118
Lord Heo asked me
to give this to you.

503
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,038
He said that you would need this
to prove who you are.

504
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,301
What are you doing here
looking all dazed?

505
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:31,723
I was waiting for you.

506
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:34,309
And you came.

507
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,439
Why do you look so sullen?

508
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,484
Is someone tormenting you
at the police bureau?

509
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:45,487
I am.

510
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,072
What?

511
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,616
I think I am tormenting
everyone else.

512
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:55,706
I should have lived a quiet life.

513
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,042
That was the right thing to do.

514
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,420
I made the wrong decision.

515
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,589
- Hey...
- I am lost.

516
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,300
I wish someone could explain it
to me.

517
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:09,303
But I do not know...

518
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,308
what to ask to whom
in order for no one to get hurt.

519
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,687
I have no idea.

520
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:20,856
I am lost.

521
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,660
I was blabbering too much.

522
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,412
Forget it.

523
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:38,457
Forget everything I just said.

524
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,586
I had no idea
what you were saying anyway.

525
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:48,217
Enough with the pitying.
Go home and get some rest.

526
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:49,468
Go.

527
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,428
Let me walk you home first.

528
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,347
No one will welcome you there.

529
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,182
- So leave.
- No.

530
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,809
You go wherever you please.

531
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,895
Let me do the same.

532
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,609
What? Hey.

533
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,989
Go now.

534
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:12,950
No.

535
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,996
Do you still like me?

536
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,249
I am always so coldhearted
towards you.

537
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:24,753
You look beautiful in my eyes.

538
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:29,341
Why are you so complicated?

539
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:34,513
What are you so afraid of?

540
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,224
Why are you so fearless?

541
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,310
You do not know
what tomorrow will bring.

542
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,312
That is exactly why...

543
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,314
I say whatever I want.

544
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:48,193
And I am walking you home
because I want to.

545
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,285
We should...

546
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:58,287
hold hands as well.

547
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:03,292
I will let go once
we get to the end of this road.

548
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,546
Then I should walk slowly.

549
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:31,361
I was not aware of what happened
at the chancellor's place.

550
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:34,364
I am certain Jung Yun Jeo was there.

551
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,909
We must catch him ourselves.

552
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,285
I will head to Aseowon.

553
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,120
Tail Nok Du for me.

554
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,164
He will try to find his father.

555
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:49,213
This is a drawing of Jung Yun Jeo.

556
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:51,215
Move secretively.

557
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:31,839
You...

558
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,676
Do you still dress like a woman?

559
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,428
I have my reasons.

560
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:42,474
By the way, did you go to
the chancellor's house, did you not?

561
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:44,893
How do you know that?

562
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,104
What happened to the man
whom you rescued?

563
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,857
How are his injuries?

564
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,193
- He left that day...
- Where to?

565
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:59,241
He left because he could not
trust me. He did not tell where.

566
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,079
Who is he?

567
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,040
He is my father.

568
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,335
I see.

569
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:14,131
He was slightly injured,
but he left in good condition.

570
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,008
He left
with the chancellor's right hand,

571
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:17,384
so do not worry.

572
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,468
I see.

573
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:22,764
By the way, why are you here?

574
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:27,144
Will you take revenge
on Grand Prince Neungyang?

575
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,313
"Revenge"?

576
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,861
He is not home yet.

577
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,742
Then could you give this to him?

578
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,370
This is the only thing I know
that he likes.

579
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:29,498
You should wait
and give it yourself.

580
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,835
I need to go somewhere.

581
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:36,463
Is that so? Then you can come back
and give it to him.

582
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,228
Please give this to him.

583
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,188
Well, okay.

584
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,609
Goodbye, then.

585
00:46:57,693 --> 00:46:58,777
Bye.

586
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:28,849
Chief Administrative Officer?

587
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,442
We came here because of you.

588
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:41,028
Why do you look so frail...

589
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,779
as if you have not eaten for days?

590
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,699
Did you fail to catch a thief
or something?

591
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,162
I always fail to catch them.

592
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,373
But...

593
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,543
were you on your way
to the gisaeng house?

594
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,337
Yes.

595
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,006
I had something to do there.

596
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,509
I am sure you do not want
to become a gisaeng.

597
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:04,885
You are right. That is not why.

598
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:08,263
I am trying hard to find a job
as a servant in the palace.

599
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:10,641
Your goal...

600
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:13,519
is also to enter the palace?

601
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,020
I heard you get to earn...

602
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,855
a stable income
if you get a job in the palace.

603
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:18,941
I see.

604
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:27,199
I guess you are still
having trouble falling asleep.

605
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,410
Have you not tried
what I told you to do?

606
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,206
No, I could not do it.

607
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,458
It has been a long time...

608
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:40,796
since I left my wife to be lonely
all by herself.

609
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,217
I could not dare to bother her
and ask her to soothe me...

610
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,096
after all those years.

611
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,306
That is okay.

612
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,768
You may have left her
to be lonely for a long time.

613
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:57,271
But who knows?
She might also be waiting for you.

614
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:01,817
She might be waiting for you
to reach out to her.

615
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:16,039
(Inn)

616
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,173
Boss.

617
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:27,092
I will find those jerks tomorrow
no matter what.

618
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,136
You should stand guard and wait.

619
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,220
Okay.

620
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:32,723
Hey, you are...

621
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:35,225
Look who is here.

622
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:38,145
The foot of the lamp is always dark.

623
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:41,148
I searched all over for you,
but I could not find you.

624
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,400
But we ended up meeting so nearby.

625
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,860
I am so glad to see you.

626
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:47,070
I think you have the wrong person.

627
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:49,489
Oh, is that so?

628
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:51,575
Let me see.

629
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:53,827
- Boss! My goodness!
- It hurts.

630
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:55,412
Hurry up and run after her!

631
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,414
- Let us go!
- That little brat!

632
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,923
(A plague has spread...)

633
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,179
That little brat.

634
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,270
Why do you keep running?

635
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:23,106
My bottom hurts so much
because of all the beating I got.

636
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,568
Let me see.
You stole my money,

637
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:29,238
and you made me get a flogging.

638
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,244
No, it is okay. Come here.

639
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:37,037
Come here.

640
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,956
It is dangerous. Get over here.

641
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:46,338
My goodness.

642
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:47,714
What...

643
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,593
(A plague has spread...)

644
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,096
Boss! Boss!

645
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:55,264
My goodness, Boss!

646
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,182
What are you doing here?

647
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:00,269
Everyone in this village died
because of a plague.

648
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:02,855
- A plague?
- Yes.

649
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,235
- She is dead. She has to be dead.
- Yes.

650
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:09,236
I bet she is dead.

651
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,404
Move.

652
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,963
- Master.
- Hey, you are here.

653
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,298
By the way,

654
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:31,341
is there anything wrong
with Dong Joo?

655
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:35,721
- Why?
- She dropped by earlier...

656
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:37,598
and asked me to give you this.

657
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:42,060
But she looked
very desperate and sad.

658
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:01,580
Where am I?

659
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,459
Is anyone there?

660
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:07,211
Hello?

661
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:09,796
Help!

662
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,673
Help! Someone is down here!

663
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,300
Hello?

664
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:24,686
Hello? Is anyone up there?

665
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,157
Help!

666
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:41,828
Hello?

667
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:43,497
Is anyone there?

668
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:02,349
My goodness, it is pouring.

669
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:07,062
Hey.

670
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,983
Are you sure that guy
is not hiding her?

671
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:12,317
He is also looking for her.

672
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:15,195
Then maybe she just ran away...

673
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:18,282
just like last time.

674
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,163
No.

675
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:27,249
There is no way.

676
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,042
Then where could she be?

677
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,712
You searched all over the city.

678
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:33,797
I will be back.

679
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,757
Hey, take this with you.

680
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:37,176
Take this.

681
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,303
Go on.

682
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:43,515
My goodness.

683
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,772
Help.

684
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,817
Someone is down here!

685
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:04,912
Help...

686
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:32,689
Nice one.

687
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,274
I need to go home now.

688
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:39,238
- Let us try one more time.
- My gosh.

689
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:40,697
Hey, come on.

690
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:42,324
That is not fair.

691
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:44,743
- Let us try again.
- No way.

692
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:46,828
- My gosh, come on.
- Stop it.

693
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:48,997
I said I need to go home now.

694
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:55,170
There is not much left.

695
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:57,047
Boss!

696
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:01,176
I finally found you, you darn jerk.

697
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:03,887
- Get out of my way.
- No.

698
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,348
I am going to kill you today.

699
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:07,808
I will let you meet...

700
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:10,477
your girlfriend in paradise.
You can look forward to it.

701
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:11,562
What?

702
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:15,190
Oh, I guess you did not know.

703
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:17,317
She is dead.

704
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:19,903
I killed her.

705
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:58,066
We should...

706
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,194
hold hands as well.

707
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,243
I will let go once
we get to the end of this road.

708
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:18,295
Then I should walk slowly.

709
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:51,662
Dong Joo!

710
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:00,712
No, Dong Joo.

711
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:09,054
No, Dong Joo.

712
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,059
Dong Joo, wake up. No!

713
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,986
Dong Joo.

714
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:27,239
Dong Joo, wake up. Dong Joo!

715
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:51,138
I am ashamed to say this,

716
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:53,223
but I cannot seem to fall asleep.

717
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,225
Please forgive my bad manners.

718
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:56,977
Pardon?

719
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,438
It is not your fault.

720
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,191
Everything is...

721
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:07,738
Everything is my fault.

722
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:10,574
Your Majesty.

723
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,660
If it pleases you,

724
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:16,455
could you...

725
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,082
stay with me...

726
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,793
tonight?

727
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,046
Just like old times.

728
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,820
Are you all right? Are you awake?

729
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,708
What are you doing?
You should not move around yet.

730
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:06,129
Go away. Go.

731
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:11,593
Hey.

732
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,304
How could you say that...

733
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:16,682
to me?

734
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:19,268
Do you know how worried I was?

735
00:59:19,852 --> 00:59:21,311
Did I ask you to worry about me?

736
00:59:23,272 --> 00:59:25,148
Why did you look for me?

737
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,734
Why did you jump into the well?

738
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:41,081
What is going on with you?

739
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:48,255
Dong Joo.

740
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,048
I had a task to fulfill.

741
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:53,260
I have been living my whole life
trying to complete my task.

742
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,803
Once I was done with it...

743
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:58,265
When I join my mother
after completing my task,

744
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:00,309
I thought I could be really happy.

745
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:03,520
That was the reason I lived for.

746
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:06,023
But...

747
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,483
I was about to die
even before completing my task.

748
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:10,402
Why...

749
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,654
Why did it have to be you?

750
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,826
Why did I think of you?

751
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:20,829
Why did I only think of you
at that moment?

752
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:25,125
You keep making me want to live.

753
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,669
You keep...

754
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:34,801
I do not know...

755
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:39,431
what you are trying to fulfill
at the expense...

756
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,309
of distancing yourself from me.

757
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:45,896
I do not know
what you are afraid of.

758
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:48,565
But whatever that may be...

759
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,485
or whatever happens to us,

760
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:54,530
we are alive and together now.

761
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,619
So...

762
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,830
can you not follow your heart
and just like me?

763
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:08,252
I just...

764
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,170
like...

765
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:14,049
I really...

766
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,260
like you.

767
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,429
I like you.

768
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,307
Fine. I like you.

769
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:26,186
I like you so much
that I am about to lose my mind.
