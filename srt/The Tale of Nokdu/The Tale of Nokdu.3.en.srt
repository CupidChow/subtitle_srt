(Episode 5)

6
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,905
Let us begin.

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
I will go and see what it is.

8
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,286
No.

9
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,371
I will go.

10
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,647
Gosh.

11
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,566
Oh, my.

12
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,987
So...

13
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,616
So...

14
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,576
Darn it. Come here!

15
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,869
Hold on.

16
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,954
Come here!

17
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,879
Be quiet!

18
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,703
Wait...

19
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,458
Dong Joo.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,919
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,256
Well... We were just...

22
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,137
I was getting my hair trimmed.

23
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,976
That is right. I was trimming it.

24
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,938
You did not trim it. You ruined it.

25
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,444
Lady Kim, what is wrong
with your face?

26
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:21,326
She was going to put
makeup on me.

27
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,505
We heard a man's voice
from this room.

28
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,715
Was it...

29
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,644
I made a mistake
while using these scissors.

30
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,439
Were you the one
who made that sound?

31
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,816
I was in so much pain.

32
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,777
I am truly sorry.

33
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,822
We should go back
to our room to apply some salve.

34
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,660
Yes, we should.

35
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,121
Goodbye, then.

36
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,336
Oh, dear.

37
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,235
(The Tale of Nokdu)

38
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,409
- Darn it.
- Goodness.

39
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,664
- Come here.
- Hey!

40
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,509
Do you not remember me?
I saved your life in Hanyang.

41
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,804
You pretended to be a man as well.
Should I tell Lady Chun about it?

42
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,683
What is this? Have you been
tailing me all the way from Hanyang?

43
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,394
No, our routes just overlapped.

44
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,020
Imagine how shocked
I must have been...

45
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,940
to find a man's gown and headband
in a gisaeng's room.

46
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,149
And I recognized them.

47
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,110
You told me that you
did not look through my bag!

48
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,028
I did not look through it.

49
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,864
I just saw them by coincidence.

50
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,115
You little...

51
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,741
- You...
- Come on, now.

52
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,121
- Goodness.
- Dong Joo.

53
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,791
Hey. Good luck.

54
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,211
- Gosh.
- Hey.

55
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,880
Darn it.

56
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,260
Have you checked
all the nearby islands?

57
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,469
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,307
I did, but I could not find him.

59
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,145
You have not found any leads?

60
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,149
I did find a peculiar place.

61
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,155
All the inhabitants on that island
were women.

62
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,241
They were all women?

63
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,758
It is cold outside.

64
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,552
Have you come out
for a stroll, Mother?

65
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,722
The weather is not too cold
just yet.

66
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,393
But it may be frigid
for our young Prince Yeongchang.

67
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,607
Are you not cold?

68
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,819
No... No, I am not,

69
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,279
Your Majesty.

70
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,866
You must be careful at all times.

71
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,245
It would be terrible
if you caught a cold.

72
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,749
When it comes to misfortunes,

73
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,837
they come all of a sudden
without a warning.

74
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,005
Let us go.

75
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,772
Are you sure you saw a man?

76
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,234
He was covered in a black cloth,
so I could not see him clearly.

77
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,863
If he has witnessed anything,
that would be troublesome.

78
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,948
I doubt he saw anything
since it is impossible...

79
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,616
to enter the shrine.

80
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,410
He may come back,

81
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,995
so strengthen your security.

82
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,788
Yes, we will.

83
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,384
What happened?

84
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,262
It is nothing. Let us begin.

85
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,389
His Majesty is becoming
more anxious...

86
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,849
because of Prince Yeongchang.

87
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,850
That is right.

88
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,895
Since the Crown Prince passed away,
his position is vacant as of now.

89
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,646
Of course, he is anxious.

90
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,316
He is getting rid of those...

91
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,902
around Prince Yeongchang
for plotting treason.

92
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,530
One of us could be next.

93
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,407
Before the investiture...

94
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,242
I was going to wait...

95
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,161
until Prince Yeongchang grew up.

96
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,370
But I do not think we have time.

97
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,165
Then what do you plan to do?

98
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,712
We must begin the revolt
sooner than expected.

99
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,310
You had plans to meet
your beloved woman here?

100
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,771
- Yes.
- I see.

101
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,481
But in this state?

102
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,359
Did it have to be like this?

103
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,362
After my lady was widowed,

104
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,615
her family wanted her
to commit suicide.

105
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,283
That is why we fled together.

106
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,411
While running away,
we got separated.

107
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,622
Since I was still being chased,

108
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,666
I had no choice but to do this.

109
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,340
When will she come?

110
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,218
Soon. She will come in a few days.

111
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,719
She will surely come.

112
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,139
Once she comes,
I will leave with her. I will.

113
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,311
What a disgusting scumbag.

114
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,146
I cannot believe I wanted
to treat you like an older sister.

115
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,983
That is why I said
I could not be your older sister.

116
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,653
By the way, I feel offended
to be called so.

117
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,197
I took good care of you.

118
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,532
As if.

119
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,620
Yes, that is it.

120
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,205
My back.

121
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,542
You touched my back!

122
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,544
Hey! You asked me to.

123
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,837
You should have refused.

124
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,963
You touched me too.

125
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,089
Where?

126
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,930
See? The more we talk about this,
the more uncomfortable it gets.

127
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:01,018
So do not ask any questions
and give me a few days.

128
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,645
I will disappear like smoke.

129
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:04,813
I promise.

130
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:05,939
Darn it.

131
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,319
I am sorry about many things.

132
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,365
Since I am sorry,
I will sleep outside for the night.

133
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,327
Freeze right there.
You are not going anywhere.

134
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,703
Stay by my side.

135
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,497
Hey. I...

136
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:23,999
I am in love with my lady.

137
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,501
Have you gone insane?

138
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,544
They all think you are a woman,
so do not try to do anything.

139
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,046
What do you mean?

140
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,256
Stop treating me like a pervert.

141
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,634
During your stay here,

142
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,095
you better never dream
about leaving my sight, got it?

143
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,641
Then what?

144
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,518
Do you want us
to sleep in the same room?

145
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,851
Goodness, Lady Kim.

146
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,561
You say that you are different,

147
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,354
but your actions tell me...

148
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,273
that you are a filthy punk,
do you not think so?

149
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,944
No, I... I was just
on my way to the bathroom.

150
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,449
Okay, I will go.
I will go back inside.

151
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,210
My gosh, I need to go outside again.

152
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,651
Do you not sleep?

153
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,362
No, I do not sleep.

154
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,489
I am going to keep
an eye on you all night.

155
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,852
My gosh.

156
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,652
A group of men...

157
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,737
gathered at a place
where only women live.

158
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,114
They are the leaders.

159
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,742
And one of them
must have given the orders.

160
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,950
Are they conspiring something?

161
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,744
But I wonder why they tried
to harm my family.

162
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,665
Exactly. It was unlike us
to do such a thing.

163
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,668
Who made that order?

164
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,296
That is something...

165
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,506
only the boss would know.

166
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,342
They get orders from their boss...

167
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,636
and are not aware of the details.

168
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,724
They are unnecessarily systematic.

169
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,440
In order to find out who the boss is
and who those men are,

170
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,611
I need to approach the ladies.

171
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,405
That filthy punk...

172
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,325
was afraid of getting caught
by the widows,

173
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,119
so he ended up coming
to our gisaeng house.

174
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,621
He came here?

175
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,123
My goodness.

176
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,083
Do you really think
he did something bad?

177
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,293
It is true.

178
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,295
He entered the village for widows
a few days ago.

179
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,339
And he got kicked out
after getting a good beating.

180
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,508
But he failed to learn his lesson
and went back there again.

181
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,637
My goodness,
what a disgraceful punk.

182
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,931
So Lady Chun and the vice-curator...

183
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,266
are going to hand out a sketch
of that man.

184
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,434
Oh, a sketch?

185
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,520
So there is no need to be afraid.

186
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,980
We will be able to catch him
if we all cooperate.

187
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,316
That is good news.

188
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,817
That is good to hear.

189
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,070
What are you doing here?

190
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,530
Hey, did you hear?

191
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,240
- Last night...
- Tell me later.

192
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,076
- Let us go. Come on.
- What?

193
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,411
She is worried
because I did not have breakfast.

194
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,330
She cares for me so much.

195
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,298
I told you not to go anywhere!

196
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,466
What is this?

197
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,260
I was just kidding,
but you really got me breakfast.

198
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:27,928
Do not get mistaken.

199
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,638
I did not make breakfast for you.

200
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,058
But what is this seaweed soup?

201
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,686
You could not have known
that it is my birthday today.

202
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,856
- Is it your birthday today?
- Yes.

203
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,860
The only thing my dad told me...

204
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,111
was the day I was born.

205
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,739
Hey.

206
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,741
Are you not going to have the soup?

207
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,368
I do not like seaweed soup.

208
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,460
I do not hate it enough
to give it to you.

209
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,922
They say you can pay back your debts
by being kind to people.

210
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,049
But you are probably
indebted to people instead.

211
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,801
I am not indebted to anyone.

212
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,094
That will never happen.

213
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,180
You never know.

214
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,639
Look at me.

215
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,558
- I am...
- Exactly.

216
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,560
You are a man
who is dressed up as a woman,

217
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,020
and you even hit on the gisaengs.

218
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,354
I did not hit on them.

219
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,814
Do not deny it.

220
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,608
Then why did you go talk to them...

221
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,901
as soon as you woke up?

222
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,821
I wonder if your lady knows
how perverted you are.

223
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,448
"Perverted"?

224
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,949
I was just talking to them.

225
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,367
Am I not even allowed to talk?

226
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,578
Oh, I see.
Then you should go ahead...

227
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,538
and say that to your lady as well.

228
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,791
My lady is not as twisted as you.

229
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,877
Dong Joo.

230
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,428
Eat up.

231
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,804
You too.

232
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,348
Dong Joo.

233
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,433
Our dance practice will soon begin.

234
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,143
Lady Chun asked you to come.

235
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,436
Okay.

236
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:09,988
Should I help you?

237
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,698
I am really good at cutting hair.

238
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,249
Can you please just go alone?

239
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,667
I need to do something.

240
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,085
Cut the nonsense.

241
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,045
I told you not to do anything...

242
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,588
And you told me not to go anywhere.

243
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,216
I know you desperately asked me
to stay by your side.

244
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,884
Do not say it like that.

245
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,555
Will you please trust me
just this once?

246
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,517
Okay, let us go. Come on.

247
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,185
I will go.

248
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,317
Dong Joo.

249
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,152
Stop.

250
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,785
Try again.

251
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,662
Spread your arm out like this.

252
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,916
Spread it out.

253
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,710
So you are saying
he is a disgraceful punk...

254
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,253
who keeps entering
the village for widows...

255
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,755
and the gisaeng house?

256
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,173
Yes, that is correct.

257
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,717
Do you not think...

258
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,511
that you have seen him before?

259
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,099
I am not sure.
Maybe he was here as a guest.

260
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,434
Oh my goodness.

261
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,199
I will search the hill.

262
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,034
- You should...
- My goodness.

263
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,953
I heard they caught
that disgraceful punk.

264
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,413
My goodness, I heard...

265
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,332
a widow ran into him.

266
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,544
- Let us go see that man's face.
- Let us go.

267
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,681
My goodness.

268
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,433
Where did you meet him?

269
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,893
Did you have a fight with him?

270
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,311
Is that how you got hurt?

271
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,772
Tell us what happened in detail.

272
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,651
It is too embarrassing.

273
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,778
- Come on.
- Please.

274
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,154
Calm down, everyone.

275
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,243
Did he try to harm you?

276
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,329
It happened a while ago.

277
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,082
I went to the hill to take a walk.

278
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,043
And that man suddenly
started to approach me,

279
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,461
so I ended up...

280
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,135
You did a shoulder throw on a man?

281
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,430
And that is when he suddenly
took out his knife.

282
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,538
- My goodness!
- Oh, gosh!

283
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,042
This is so upsetting.

284
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,752
It is very embarrassing,
but I thought...

285
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,795
I should tell you ladies
so you could catch him.

286
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,756
Where did he run off?

287
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,467
He went to the neighboring village.

288
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,803
Was it this man?

289
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,226
Yes, it was him.

290
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,645
He was wearing an indigo gown...

291
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,605
- and a hat...
- That jerk wore a hat.

292
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,066
It must be him.

293
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:16,610
"Jerk"?

294
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:18,904
But...

295
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,614
he did seem...

296
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,491
a lot more good-looking
than the sketch.

297
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,828
Or maybe not.

298
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,580
By any chance,

299
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,457
would you happen to have
an ink stick and a brush?

300
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,214
How dare he run away?
I should just finish him.

301
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,634
Gosh, but this is the only time
I can go to the mountain too.

302
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:41,802
Dong Joo.

303
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,515
This is what you asked me
to get the other day.

304
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,226
You barely put on makeup.

305
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,436
Why do you collect
rare combs and cosmetics?

306
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,479
You do not even have the money
for them.

307
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:53,689
Mind your own business.

308
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,941
Are you sure this is rare?

309
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,110
Of course. I bet...

310
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,321
even the court ladies in the palace
will not have that.

311
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,408
What is it? What is that for?

312
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,869
- You do not need to know.
- Tell me.

313
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,426
Since he got a cut on his face,

314
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,469
he would have definitely
looked like this.

315
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,514
Yes, the cut on his face
looks very unique.

316
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:30,601
I am sure you can easily spot him
wherever he is.

317
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,312
Thank you.
This will be very helpful.

318
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,147
All right.

319
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,026
We will go and visit
the neighboring village.

320
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,485
Let us join you.

321
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,612
No.

322
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,405
This is dangerous. Please stay here.

323
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,782
Yes. Just trust us on this.

324
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,914
I was...

325
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,333
right about you.

326
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,668
Once I come back,

327
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,254
let us discuss your future here.

328
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,965
My future? Why?

329
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,675
Join the Virtuous Women Corps...

330
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,678
and protect the village with us.

331
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,473
No, no. I do not need to.

332
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,101
- My gosh. You are the best.
- This is great.

333
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,395
- We believe in you.
- We believe in you!

334
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,522
Please catch him!

335
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,815
- I like where I am now.
- Please get him!

336
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,609
- I do not need to do that.
- Good luck.

337
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,531
That is indeed strange.

338
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:28,075
How could you go up against a man?
You are just a woman.

339
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,369
There were a lot of generals
in my mother's family,

340
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,995
so I used to play
with a wooden sword...

341
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,540
with my brothers
and my parents used to scold me.

342
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,835
I cannot sew for the life of me,
but I like using my strength.

343
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,005
By the way,
are you all going somewhere?

344
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,633
- We are trying to catch that punk.
- We were on our way...

345
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,093
to gather firewood.

346
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,345
You must go
and see a physician first.

347
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,391
I can just lick this wound,
and it will all be better.

348
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,352
By the way,
I am pretty good at axing.

349
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,980
I can help you with that.
It is that way, right?

350
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,190
- Wait, wait.
- Hurry.

351
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,862
What is this? Are we really going
to gather firewood? Seriously?

352
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,113
We cannot go
to the neighboring village...

353
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,239
in a group like this.

354
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,907
And we do need some firewood.

355
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:12,786
- I will head out to catch him.
- Okay.

356
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,830
It is broad daylight.
A lot of people will be watching.

357
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,123
Be careful.

358
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,753
Can you let me skip it today?
I have a lot of work to do.

359
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,547
I am so exhausted right now.

360
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,051
I will never have a chance
like that again.

361
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,263
Is there anything else than this?

362
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,034
Let us stop watching her
and get to work.

363
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,663
That tree over there looks sturdy.
I will go and ax that tree.

364
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

365
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,336
She is something else, is she not?

366
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:45,629
Let us just tell her the truth.

367
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,631
Do not be so rash.

368
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:50,509
We do need more people.

369
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,719
Being strong is not the only factor.

370
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:53,762
Right.

371
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,973
Let us focus on tomorrow's project.

372
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,599
Be at the brewery at three o'clock.

373
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:58,809
Okay.

374
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,151
You are planning
something for tomorrow night?

375
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,070
I ought to join them then.

376
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,205
Darn it. Oh, no.

377
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,498
Darn it.

378
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,429
I think we have enough.

379
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,348
I will go and get Lady Kim.

380
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,516
Okay.

381
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,394
We will wrap up here.

382
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,075
Goodness.

383
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,746
All right. Okay.

384
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,333
Lady Kim.

385
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,252
Lady Kim. Are you over there?

386
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:14,551
Dong Joo.

387
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,012
Hey. Dong Joo.

388
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,472
Help me out.

389
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,183
Goodness, you cannot get
more humiliating than this.

390
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,643
Why did you take off your clothes?
It is nasty.

391
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,062
I did not do it on purpose.
I was axing the trees...

392
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,189
Hey, take off this for me.

393
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,191
You lunatic.

394
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:30,567
No, you got the wrong idea.

395
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,277
Hey. Help me out just this once.

396
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,363
I am begging you. Please.

397
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,573
Hey, that is not
how you ask someone for a favor.

398
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:39,576
Call me Lady Dong. Go ahead.

399
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,246
Lady Dong. Please.

400
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,165
Lady Kim, we should head down now.

401
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:46,708
- What should I do?
- What was that?

402
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,335
What? Go over there.

403
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,755
Lady Kim, let us get going now.

404
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,549
Darn it.

405
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,426
This way. Go that way. Hurry up.

406
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:59,638
Lady Kim?

407
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,975
Lady Kim.

408
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,512
Hello.

409
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:42,598
What are you doing there?

410
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:45,350
I came here to practice dancing,

411
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:46,977
but it is such a hot day today.

412
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,063
I convinced Lady Kim
to have a bath with me.

413
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,066
You two had a bath together?

414
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,778
Yes. We scrubbed each other's back
several times.

415
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,782
She is an excellent scrubber.
It feels great, you know.

416
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,244
Right, right. She is indeed strong.

417
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,331
What do you say?
Would you like to join us?

418
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,457
What?

419
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,669
Will you join us?

420
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,590
No.

421
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:19,593
We must head back to the brewery.
Take your time.

422
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,179
Okay. Bye.

423
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:39,696
Cover yourself with this.

424
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,449
You cover yourself up.
I do not want to see that.

425
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,130
So...

426
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,925
you came here to practice dancing?

427
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,009
What?

428
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:03,804
Yes.

429
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,723
Well, why would I come here
if not for that?

430
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,268
I see.

431
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:14,106
Right. You do need to practice.

432
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,399
A lot.

433
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:17,025
A lot, indeed.

434
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,068
Darn you.

435
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:24,908
I mean, is this that hard?

436
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,870
So it looks easy when you watch,
does it not?

437
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,788
You should try it. Once you do,
you will know it is very difficult.

438
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,709
Goodness.

439
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,254
Gosh.

440
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,966
I will be your daughter if you can
pull off even one dance move.

441
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,630
Hey, my daughter.

442
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:22,174
Seriously?

443
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,134
Did you learn to dance?

444
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,595
No. I saw you practice earlier.

445
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,097
You can dance like that
after seeing it just once?

446
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,600
Yes. Can everyone do the same?

447
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:34,853
I already did not like him,

448
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,647
but I hate him now.

449
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,776
Hey, do you want me to teach you?

450
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,152
Do not try to fool me.

451
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,612
Stand up.

452
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:47,866
Okay. Stand here.

453
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,368
Watch me.

454
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:52,579
Have this edge move
from outside to inside.

455
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,873
Open it up gently
as if you are striking it.

456
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:56,959
Try it.

457
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,593
Okay. Good job.

458
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:07,970
All right.

459
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:11,473
Have the fan blade on your arm.

460
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,684
Stretch out your left hand too.

461
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,687
From this pose, move your fan...

462
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,480
this way.

463
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,983
Move the fan in front of your face
as if you are stroking it.

464
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,026
Make a big circle.

465
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:24,695
After that,

466
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,114
bring it down to the side.

467
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,411
Turn to your left again.

468
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,580
After your turn,

469
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,039
raise your fan upward.

470
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,001
To the side.

471
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:40,878
To the side.

472
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:41,962
Just like this.

473
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:44,423
Lower it now.

474
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,680
Do not count the beat.

475
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,140
It will confuse you even more.

476
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,559
Actually,
use your breathing instead.

477
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:56,935
Look.

478
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,729
As you lift your left foot,

479
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,564
inhale.

480
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,651
And turn to your left.

481
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,792
Hey.

482
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,462
I mean it when I say this.

483
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,429
Let us find a new career
for you. Okay?

484
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,889
Come on.

485
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,642
No matter how hard I think about it,

486
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,769
I do not believe
you are meant to be a gisaeng.

487
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:39,978
In life,

488
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,189
you cannot do everything you want
just because you want to.

489
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,482
When did I say I wanted this?

490
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,817
I am not doing this
because I want to.

491
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,070
I do not want to be a gisaeng.

492
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:51,573
Wait.

493
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:53,784
I cannot do everything I want
because I want to?

494
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,370
No.

495
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,289
You cannot avoid doing some things
just because you want to avoid.

496
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,832
That is life.

497
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:07,965
I was short-sighted.

498
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:09,299
Sorry.

499
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,593
Forget it.

500
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,679
I guess you were a lucky slave
who did not have to do things...

501
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:15,514
you did not want to
thanks to your lady.

502
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,268
I was not allowed to do anything...

503
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,186
including things I wanted to do...

504
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,021
and things I did not want to do.

505
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,026
But now, I will not live that way.

506
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,487
I will do what I want to do...

507
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,447
and do what I do not want to do...

508
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:33,907
just like everyone else.

509
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:37,870
"Like everyone else"?

510
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,122
It must have been hard for you...

511
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,749
to stay here by doing things
you did not want to do.

512
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:56,180
What? Do you find me
good-looking all of a sudden?

513
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,431
I am pretty handsome, right?

514
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:02,895
What was that?

515
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,814
I thought you were going
to throw something at me.

516
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:09,067
You are not handsome at all.

517
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,279
Our clothes are pretty dry now.
Let us go back.

518
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,124
Wait up.

519
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,466
Are you on your way
from the village for widows?

520
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,950
So she fell into the water
when she was practicing dancing?

521
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,910
That means...

522
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,162
you must have watched
Dong Joo dance.

523
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,706
Yes, I have.

524
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:07,000
- It was...
- Cute. Right?

525
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,673
Sure. I did not know
you would call that cute.

526
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:15,884
If that happened, you should have
lent her your gown.

527
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:16,969
Dong Joo is susceptible to colds,

528
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,554
so she easily catches a cold.

529
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,390
I fell into the water too.

530
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,017
I hate being cold too.

531
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,729
My apologies.
Would you like to have some of this?

532
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,863
Do not take it off. I am not cold.

533
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,201
Do not take it out.
I will not accept it.

534
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:43,996
You do catch on quickly.

535
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,963
This is really delicious.

536
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:54,756
Take it and hide it.

537
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,967
Make sure you eat this by yourself.

538
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:05,851
Lady Kim.

539
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,688
Yes? What is it?

540
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,942
He has given me this
to wish you a happy birthday.

541
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,447
Happy birthday.

542
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,033
I am not a kid.

543
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,501
Come to think of it, today is...

544
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,837
What is it?
Is today someone's birthday too?

545
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:36,173
No, it is nothing.

546
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,665
What are you doing here?

547
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:15,921
Only after following Your Majesty
out of the palace during the war,

548
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,632
I realized
that I was carrying a child.

549
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,261
I did not have any appetite.

550
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,472
I could only eat...

551
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,184
this okchundang
Court Lady Kim brought for me.

552
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:32,312
I wonder if you remember that,
Your Majesty.

553
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:36,441
You always mention it every year.

554
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,069
How could I not remember it?

555
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,115
Had the child lived,

556
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:46,910
do you think
the child also liked okchundang?

557
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,289
The child is dead.

558
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:51,915
The child is gone.

559
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,878
- Please stop it.
- We had to say goodbye...

560
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,629
as soon as
I gave birth to our child.

561
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,883
Why am I not allowed
to miss my lost child?

562
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,927
Why do you always look so appalled?

563
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,208
What was her name?

564
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,543
Her name is Dong Joo.

565
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,462
I can tell...

566
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,631
that she is over 12 at a glance.

567
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,224
Gosh.

568
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:53,519
Hey, wait.

569
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:56,522
Goodness, let go of me.

570
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,357
It is pitch-dark outside.

571
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,859
Where are you going?

572
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,320
Now that everyone is safe,

573
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,613
I should look for Nokdu.

574
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:07,282
Do you think you can persuade him?

575
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,243
Did you see his face when he left?

576
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,453
I do not know what happened,
but he will never return...

577
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,164
before he finds out
what he wants to know.

578
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,874
But it is too dangerous.

579
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,626
If he finds out about anything,
he will be in more danger.

580
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,378
He can defend himself.

581
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,963
And if you leave this late at night,

582
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:23,257
not only will you fail
to reach Hanyang,

583
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,634
but you will be eaten alive
by a tiger. It will come for you.

584
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,056
Let us go back inside.

585
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:33,892
You do not want to be eaten alive.

586
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,730
Come on.

587
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,996
Even if I untied myself,
you would never know.

588
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:56,206
You cannot hear anything
when you are asleep.

589
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,418
What? What did you do
when I was asleep?

590
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,634
Forget it.

591
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:14,725
I really have no interest in women.

592
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,979
I should not,
and I have no time for that either.

593
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,860
Do you love your lady that much?

594
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,328
Of course, I do.

595
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:40,125
I yearn for her. I miss her.

596
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,922
What I mean is,

597
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:48,467
you do not need to worry
about such things.

598
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:52,971
Fine.

599
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:56,892
Thank you for the love confession
which I was not even curious about.

600
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:00,896
Hey.

601
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,942
Turn off the candles.
You need to be economical.

602
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,806
I am at the brewery to make malt.

603
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:38,308
Who are you?

604
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,561
Who are you talking about?

605
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,312
Oh, it is nothing.

606
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,524
Did you spot someone suspicious?

607
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,901
Not at all.

608
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,905
By the way, what brings you here?

609
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:52,865
Well...

610
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:57,536
Is Lady Kim in?

611
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,832
No, she is
at the village for widows.

612
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:08,172
She should not roam around alone.
It is dangerous.

613
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:09,506
Sorry?

614
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:17,181
Where should I put this?

615
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:20,976
There is a place
where we store them over there.

616
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,060
Okay.

617
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:47,127
Why are you here?

618
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:49,963
Is this not the room?

619
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:55,844
There is a side door over there
that leads to the backyard.

620
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:59,139
No wonder. I deemed it strange
to store these crocks indoors.

621
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:07,231
By the way, will I really get paid
for doing this?

622
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:08,941
Of course.

623
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:11,401
Goodbye, then.

624
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,309
He entered the village for widows
and got kicked out.

625
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:47,145
But he failed to learn his lesson
and went back there again.

626
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,648
I heard he is quite wicked.

627
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:52,192
When it comes to women,
he tempts anyone...

628
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:54,778
from gisaengs to widows.

629
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,580
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh, dear.

630
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,835
Oh, my. Are you okay?

631
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:13,255
How did you know I tripped?

632
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,591
Stop it, now.

633
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,676
- You made my heart flutter.
- Oh, my.

634
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:20,429
If you were a man,
I would have just...

635
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:21,430
Hold on.

636
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:23,682
- Stop being so silly!
- What is wrong?

637
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:25,893
- Come with me.
- Hold on. Wait.

638
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:30,397
She is just lonely, so ignore her.

639
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,608
Snap out of it.

640
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:34,651
- Come to your senses.
- Hold on.

641
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,570
My goodness!

642
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:49,958
Excuse me.

643
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,794
Where is Dong Joo's room?

644
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:54,880
It is over there.

645
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:56,798
That is the one.

646
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:08,685
Hey, I know what you are thinking.

647
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,313
But can we talk later tonight?

648
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,857
The man who was chased away
from the village...

649
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,068
is you, right?

650
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,196
About that...

651
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:20,572
Well...

652
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,032
And yet, you still roam around?

653
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,743
You should be lying low
until your lady comes.

654
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:25,911
Well...

655
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:27,996
I...

656
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,712
Get out. I heard everything.

657
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:39,466
I heard you try to flirt
with all kinds of women.

658
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,761
Hey.

659
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,100
Is that really...

660
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,185
how you think of me?

661
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:51,854
It does not matter what I think.

662
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,897
At the village,
that is how they see you.

663
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,649
You will die if you get caught.

664
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:00,195
All right.

665
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:01,989
I will leave.

666
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:17,629
Who are you?

667
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,089
Why are you here?

668
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,849
I cannot do this on my own.

669
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:42,988
Where will you go?

670
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:45,949
Why do you care?

671
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,039
Do not do anything stupid
and just lie low.

672
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:53,123
When your lady comes, I will...

673
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,834
If something happens to me,
tell them you did not know.

674
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,420
And I will say the same.

675
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:02,424
Hey.

676
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:03,759
One minute.

677
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:10,682
What are you doing?

678
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:35,916
Go.

679
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:25,591
Why is Deul Le not here yet?

680
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,719
I have no idea. She said
she had to check something.

681
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:33,891
Let us begin without her.

682
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,147
He is the man...

683
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,149
we must kill tonight.

684
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,947
Since it is in the center
of the capital,

685
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,449
we cannot make a scene.

686
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,910
Only one of us should go
and get rid of him.

687
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:54,953
I ought to kill that scumbag.

688
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:56,538
How dare he kill
his daughter-in-law...

689
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,624
who gave birth to his grandchild
just for that virtuousness stone?

690
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,167
Let me do it.

691
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,793
Are you going to go now?

692
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:03,462
There is no need to wait.

693
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,506
Where are the ink sticks?

694
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,548
Over there.

695
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:35,744
Dong Joo! Dong Joo!

696
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:55,764
Dong Joo?

697
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:56,974
Yes.

698
00:50:57,558 --> 00:51:00,227
That girl who was brave enough
to cut her hair.

699
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:03,021
I heard...

700
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:06,567
she is already old enough
to become a gisaeng.

701
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:10,362
I have learned
from my past mistakes.

702
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:11,947
And therefore,
I wish to make a choice...

703
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,366
that does not
go against your customs.

704
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,368
Is there a problem with that?

705
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:20,956
My lord.

706
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:24,126
She may be old enough,
but she is still...

707
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:27,254
How dare you?

708
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:30,507
You do not make the choice. I do.

709
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,718
I am an aristocrat,

710
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:34,845
and you are nothing
but a bunch of gisaengs.

711
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,930
If I want to be mine,
then you will let me do that.

712
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,182
How dare you...

713
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,225
try to talk me out of it
by bringing up your customs?

714
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:41,852
Then...

715
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,688
please give me time.

716
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:45,898
No.

717
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:48,233
Are you going to call someone
to make a fool out of me again?

718
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,736
I will take her with me right now.

719
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,197
Did you not see the palanquin
I brought with me?

720
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,574
What if I refuse to give her to you?

721
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,701
What will you do then?

722
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:58,869
What do you think?

723
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:00,495
This place will have to shut down,

724
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:03,707
and all of you will end up
becoming slaves.

725
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,792
I will do you a favor...

726
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,920
and send you to a place in Tamla
so you can enjoy the view.

727
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:10,797
But I heard most people die...

728
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:13,884
on their way there
because of the dangerous boat ride.

729
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:26,230
Lady Kim?

730
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:28,232
What are you doing here?

731
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:30,108
The thing is,

732
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:33,195
I saw a ring here this afternoon.

733
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,280
And I thought maybe I might
be able to sell it and earn money.

734
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,032
I am really sorry.

735
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,076
How much of it did you hear?

736
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,203
Pardon? Oh, well...

737
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,830
You mean how you plan
to kill someone?

738
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:45,374
You heard us correctly.

739
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,377
Unfortunately.

740
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,379
Are you going to kill me?

741
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,843
What if...

742
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:58,095
I say I will do the job?

743
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:01,974
You came running so quickly.

744
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,519
I did not expect you
to be so welcoming.

745
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,939
You arrogant wench!

746
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:15,904
You should leave. Stay in your room.

747
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:17,489
No.

748
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,950
Avoiding it
will not change anything.

749
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,451
Just do as I say.

750
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:25,455
Lady Chun.

751
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:27,916
I could never say this to you
because it felt embarrassing.

752
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,168
But you know
how grateful I am, right?

753
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:33,547
You saved me from that hole
when I was a little girl.

754
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:36,008
And I have been grateful for that
every single day.

755
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:45,434
Will you come with me?

756
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,561
Or will you die?

757
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:56,403
I cannot go.

758
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:01,450
You cannot go?

759
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,703
No, I cannot go like this.

760
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,624
What kind of gisaeng leaves
looking like this?

761
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:09,625
Dong Joo.

762
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,793
- Is that so?
- It is not the right thing to do.

763
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,795
I will come back to greet you...

764
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:15,214
after I fully prepare myself.

765
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,091
Are you trying to do something
behind my back?

766
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,969
The fate of this gisaeng house
is in your hands.

767
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:22,804
I would never dare.

768
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:25,807
I already noticed that day
that you are quite different.

769
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:28,769
I really do like your guts.

770
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,813
Send her to my place by 10:30pm.

771
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:52,918
We should hear her out first.

772
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:54,670
But she heard everything.

773
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,338
What do you think?

774
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:58,257
Let us give her a chance.

775
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,690
You must be out of your mind.

776
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,068
Are you really willing to kill him?

777
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:23,448
I cannot make enough money
by working at the brewery.

778
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,492
But if I kill someone,

779
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,494
I will be able to earn
a lot of money.

780
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:33,208
What if you are just doing this
to run away?

781
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,712
I know you will not let me run away.

782
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:38,922
What is your identity?

783
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:42,509
Have you ever killed anyone?

784
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,264
I have seen many people die.

785
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,392
I am the only person who
can take care of my sick parents.

786
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:52,519
As long as I can earn
a lot of money,

787
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,646
killing someone
will not be such a big deal.

788
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,360
Okay, fine.

789
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,112
Give it a try.

790
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,782
We needed a new member anyway.

791
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:07,367
So we have nothing to lose.

792
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:11,496
If we kill her here, it will be
a hassle to get rid of the body.

793
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,829
Will you stop looking like that?

794
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:55,707
How do I look?

795
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:59,461
You are looking at me
as if this will be our last time...

796
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:00,754
seeing each other in this life.

797
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:03,382
How could you say
something like that?

798
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,137
Here.

799
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:12,307
I will not die that easily.
Do not worry.

800
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:17,604
Hwa Su, I will be off now.

801
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:20,482
By the way, does Lady Kim know?

802
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:27,281
She left.

803
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:29,491
She left?

804
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,536
At this late hour? Where?

805
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:35,414
You are right.

806
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:39,835
I let her leave at this late hour.

807
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:04,860
If you succeed in killing him
and return,

808
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:06,320
you will not only get paid,

809
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,655
but we will also let you
work with us.

810
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,657
But if you fail,

811
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:13,327
you will die right away.

812
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,639
I need to get in the palanquin now.

813
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:35,807
You two should go back inside.

814
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:38,060
That jerk is unbelievable.

815
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:42,314
Why did he have to call you
to somewhere so deserted?

816
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,066
Stop crying.

817
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:45,984
Mae Hyang...

818
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:48,987
came back dead.

819
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,574
What if you... What if you also...

820
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:54,868
I will not die.

821
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:56,828
I cannot die right now.

822
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,084
If the hair is what you want,
I will give it to you.

823
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,670
Hair always grows back.

824
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:07,172
It cannot be more important
than that little girl.

825
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:09,675
When did I say I wanted this?

826
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:11,635
I am not doing this
because I want to.

827
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:13,846
I do not want to be a gisaeng.

828
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,750
I am Dong Joo from Yeonhwa House.

829
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:00,804
It seems you are happy to see me,

830
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:04,349
but at the same time,
you are appalled at the sight of me.

831
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:09,855
Why are you here?

832
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:11,565
I had something to tell you.

833
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,359
Right now? Here?

834
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:15,527
Yes.

835
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:19,489
It perfectly suits
the time and place.

836
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:21,992
What is it?

837
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,828
So...

838
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,332
starting today, I am...

839
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:36,798
I am...

840
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:40,469
your mother.

841
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,681
You are my... What?

842
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:50,938
I...

843
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,356
am...

844
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,982
your mother.

845
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:22,886
(The Tale of Nokdu)

846
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:25,889
You should offer your greetings
every morning and evening.

847
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:28,141
My daughter, do not call me "Hey".
What if someone hears you?

848
01:03:28,225 --> 01:03:29,685
Call me Mother.

849
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,854
Do you really want me
to call you Mother?

850
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:33,397
- My gosh.
- That is awful.

851
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,607
- I hate washing dishes.
- If you cook, I will wash them.

852
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:37,067
You will do the laundry,
and I will clean.

853
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,402
- Okay.
- It is settled, right?

854
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,237
I could not turn a blind eye on her.

855
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,573
However, that was not the promise
you made to us.

856
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,783
You want me to steal
your father-in-law's jewels?

857
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:47,160
I will give you four days.
Bring them to me. Be creative.

858
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:48,996
- Are you going somewhere?
- To Hanyang. To see my lady.

859
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,414
What a faithful lover.

860
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,791
It is nice and comfortable
to be alone.

861
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,002
This is great.

862
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:58,005
Did you not see a widow
with beady eyes,

863
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:01,049
soft facial features,
and full lips come here?
