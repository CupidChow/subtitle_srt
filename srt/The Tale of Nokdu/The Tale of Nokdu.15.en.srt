00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,897
(Episode 29)

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,816
If there are hundreds of soldiers,
it means war.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,111
It is different from that time
when we crushed a dozen bandits.

8
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,947
Tell me. At times like this,

9
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,865
what is more important
than one's martial arts skills?

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,116
One's spirit.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,911
So you remember it.

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,957
- Master.
- Yes?

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,002
Please be careful. You must be.

14
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,796
Goodness, what do you take me for?

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,674
I am Hwang Jang Gun. Goodness.

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,636
I am sure you are distracted now,

17
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,721
but get a grip.

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,182
And take care of yourself, okay?

19
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,863
Do not worry.

20
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,030
I will not do anything dangerous.

21
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,034
I know that I have
no right to say this to you,

22
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,374
but regardless of
who your father is...

23
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,669
and regardless of who I am,

24
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,006
I just want to live
a happy life with you...

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,677
without having to think
about our backgrounds.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,307
I hate resenting someone.

27
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,018
And I am tired of feeling sorry
for my family.

28
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,480
I am scared to be alone
in the dark.

29
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,067
And...

30
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,780
I do not want to live
without you anymore.

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,533
So...

32
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,791
Can I do that?

33
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,212
Of course.

34
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,388
Okay.

35
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,390
Go on.

36
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,184
I will be waiting.

37
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,658
Everyone is near the back door.
I will go there as well.

38
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,993
Let me repeat myself.
Be careful.

39
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,328
We are outnumbered.

40
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,914
I will never die.

41
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,209
She said she would wait...

42
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,878
so that we could happily live
together.

43
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,506
So I must come back alive.

44
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,134
You are finally starting
to sound like the real you.

45
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,346
All right. Go on.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,939
(Donuimun)

47
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,080
Good work.

48
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,939
What do you think you are doing?

49
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,151
I am here to clear up
all the traitors.

50
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,404
If you regret your decision,
you are free to change your mind.

51
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,906
I promise that you will be forgiven.

52
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,159
No one?

53
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,454
Then I guess I have no choice.

54
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,331
Come inside.

55
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,142
Minister of War.

56
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,979
Why have you joined hands with him?

57
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,483
He had been scheming with me
up until yesterday.

58
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,068
Is it not suspicious of him...

59
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,028
to side with the King
all of a sudden?

60
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,824
Perhaps, he has another motive.

61
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,076
He may want us to fight
against each other...

62
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,995
so that he could obtain the throne.

63
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,246
That is ridiculous.

64
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,096
There is no need for that.

65
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,893
What do you mean, Your Highness?

66
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,524
While traveling, His Majesty
got into an accident...

67
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,194
and passed away.

68
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,030
What?

69
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,452
What do you mean?

70
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,455
There is no reason for him
to conspire against the King...

71
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,998
in order to take the throne.

72
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,626
He is...

73
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,588
the King's one and only son.

74
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,550
He will go through
the formalities required...

75
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,928
in order to become the king.

76
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,390
So do not utter
such ridiculous words!

77
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,524
Your Majesty, what is your reason...

78
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,401
for acting this way
toward your own son?

79
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,863
I would like to know
in case I have to kill him.

80
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,785
They said he would take the throne.

81
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,896
He will go through the formalities?

82
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,609
On what grounds?

83
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,986
I gave birth to him...

84
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,907
20 years ago.

85
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,619
What?

86
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,666
I thought he had died.

87
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,420
Can you prove that?

88
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:42,963
That is right.

89
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,340
Do you have proof?

90
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,971
I am...

91
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,684
the proof.

92
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,147
I am sure the Minister of War and
the Commandant of Palace Guards...

93
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,399
will remember me.

94
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,693
20 years ago,

95
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,446
I served the King who used
to be the Crown Prince.

96
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,990
I am Jung Yun Jeo.

97
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,828
The King had ordered me
to bury his own son.

98
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,664
I had thought he was dead,

99
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,626
but he began to breathe again
just before I buried him.

100
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,795
Therefore, I raised...

101
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,131
the King's son.

102
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:31,011
How could we trust a sinner
who was in prison...

103
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,930
not too long ago?

104
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,097
That is correct.

105
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,227
You could have brought
a random man!

106
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,770
Then what about this?

107
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,406
I had given
the other half to my son.

108
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,078
I am sure...

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,414
that every one of you...

110
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,169
has seen me
with this old norigae...

111
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,507
for the past 20 years.

112
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,867
There is no way...

113
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,829
that the Queen and I would have
conspired this...

114
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,706
for the past 20 years.

115
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,958
What do you say?

116
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,044
Is this enough proof?

117
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,834
Had I not known anything,

118
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,794
and...

119
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,464
had I lived as a father...

120
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,219
who adored his own son...

121
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,205
It is not your fault.

122
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,461
That is what I wanted to say to you.

123
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,922
I had no idea.

124
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,467
I am sorry for leaving you.

125
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,762
I was frightened.

126
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,349
I was afraid you would judge me...

127
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,060
once you had found out who I was.

128
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,855
I was afraid of what would happen
to us.

129
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,399
I was afraid of everything.

130
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,909
I am sorry for making you
endure it all by yourself.

131
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,788
I am also sorry about
what happened to your family.

132
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,164
I told you...

133
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,751
that you are not at fault
for all the terrible things...

134
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,920
that happened to us.

135
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,050
There was nothing we could do.

136
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,302
So...

137
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,981
Do not do anything
that will hurt you.

138
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,818
I do not want you...

139
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,075
to live miserably as I did.

140
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,828
I really mean that.

141
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,660
I told you to get some sleep.

142
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,161
Why are you still sitting there?

143
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,830
Where are you coming from?

144
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,541
Well...

145
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,460
I kept feeling uneasy,

146
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,212
so I went and asked around.

147
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,801
I think something has happened
in the palace.

148
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,767
Then let me ask you this.

149
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,312
If you cared so much about your son,

150
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,189
why did you try to hide him?

151
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,650
If he was still breathing,

152
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,527
you should have taken him back
to His Majesty.

153
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,530
Why did you secretly raise him
without telling anyone?

154
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,158
Oh, right.

155
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,871
Maybe the rumors were true.

156
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,873
Was it because His Majesty...

157
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,208
He wanted me dead.

158
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,502
That is right.

159
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,964
He was abandoned by His Majesty
as soon as he was born.

160
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,633
We do not even know
how he was raised.

161
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,385
And now, you wish us
to serve you as the king?

162
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,348
Do you think you are qualified?

163
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,976
You were a playboy who used to
spend time at a gisaeng house.

164
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,312
- I was...
- You were what?

165
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,523
Did you covet the throne
ever since you were young...

166
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,194
and practiced how to become
a sage king?

167
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,201
When the king's eldest son
wishes to take the throne,

168
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,287
it is not necessary for him to have
been loved by the late king.

169
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,290
I may lack a lot of things,

170
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,543
but I will seek the assistance
of the vassals who stand here.

171
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,755
There is a peaceful...

172
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,007
and legitimate way to do this.

173
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,135
Is it really necessary...

174
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,138
to shed blood?

175
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,803
Do you really think
I will let you have it your way?

176
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,433
Protect Her Highness!

177
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,444
Attack!

178
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,387
They have half the soldiers we have.

179
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,264
Do not back down and fight!

180
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,738
Do not lose him.

181
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,418
Her Highness...

182
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,545
used to stay here for a while
a long time ago.

183
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,422
It is located in a remote area,
and no one uses it anymore.

184
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,382
So it will not be easy for anyone
to find this place.

185
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,634
Okay.

186
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,528
I am sorry.

187
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,449
I did not know you were alive.

188
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,287
I can only imagine the things
you must have gone through.

189
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,041
It must have hurt you so much.

190
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,258
Mother.

191
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,141
Will you...

192
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,603
say that one more time?

193
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,775
Yes, Mother.

194
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,698
I will never lose you again.

195
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,784
Never.

196
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,319
What is the matter?

197
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,863
- Are you...
- I need to meet my father.

198
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,491
He is still in there.

199
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,212
No, you cannot go.

200
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,005
I will not let you leave.

201
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,677
What I said earlier...

202
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,473
was not merely a means
to escape the situation.

203
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,101
I mean when I announced
that you will take over the throne.

204
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,437
If...

205
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,316
His Majesty fails to come back,

206
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,819
it is only right
that you become the next king.

207
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,989
So you cannot
put yourself in danger.

208
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:18,909
Mother.

209
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,579
I am not fit for that position.

210
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,790
I understand.

211
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,793
People will resist.

212
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,087
It will be unfamiliar...

213
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,548
and difficult. However...

214
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,715
No.

215
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,342
To be honest,

216
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,429
I am scared.

217
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,142
I hoped that the throne
would not be...

218
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,604
the only reason why
His Majesty abandoned me.

219
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,816
I hoped there would be a bigger
and more important reason.

220
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,694
If that was the case,

221
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,946
I thought maybe
it would have hurt less.

222
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,867
I thought that numerous times.

223
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,076
My baby.

224
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,579
His Majesty...

225
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,499
I do not wish to become like him.

226
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,337
I do not want the throne.

227
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,965
And...

228
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,050
Regardless of who I am,

229
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,636
I just want to live
a happy life with you...

230
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,308
without having to think
about our backgrounds.

231
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,853
I do not want to live
without you anymore.

232
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,859
I am sorry, Mother.

233
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,122
You may go.

234
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:49,958
Instead,

235
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,380
promise me
that you will not get hurt.

236
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,053
Okay, I promise.

237
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,021
Please take good care of my mother.

238
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,804
- Give me your bow.
- Pardon?

239
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,640
I am going to find that jerk
and the Queen.

240
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,993
Did you just kick me?

241
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,851
So you are the best swordsman
of Joseon.

242
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,313
But that does not matter
in a messy fight like this.

243
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:36,899
What matters...

244
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,067
is one's spirit.

245
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,085
Darn it. Stop right there.

246
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,253
Gosh.

247
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,928
Darn it.

248
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,180
I am in a hurry right now.

249
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:09,640
Fine.

250
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,018
Let us make it worth my time.

251
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,405
Are you hurt?

252
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,366
Why were you alone?

253
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,492
I am fine.

254
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,869
I was looking for you.

255
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,872
I should have found you earlier.

256
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,042
Let us get out of the palace
for now. If we stay here...

257
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,293
Because Nok Du will be in trouble...

258
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,088
if I stay, right?

259
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,133
It is because you might get hurt.

260
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,177
How could you say that?

261
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,723
I equally cherish
both of you as my sons.

262
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:52,808
Then,

263
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,352
please trust me on this.

264
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,396
We can get everything back.

265
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,440
I do not wish to live
in hiding anymore, Father.

266
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,609
Hwang Tae.

267
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,319
It is Jung Eui Young.

268
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,739
My grandfather named me
Jung Eui Young.

269
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,122
I am well aware that I do not have
the right to stop you.

270
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,959
However, how can you not see
that this is not the right path?

271
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,919
Yes, I know it is not right.

272
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,964
But what have we gained
after choosing the right path?

273
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,675
My mother passed away.

274
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,469
And everything
I believed in collapsed.

275
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,726
I will go back
to Grand Prince Neungyang.

276
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,979
What did that man promise to you?

277
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,900
Did he promise
to get your identity back...

278
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,651
and give you a position
at the palace?

279
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,111
Yes.

280
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,114
He promised to me.

281
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:51,825
Why? Why would he make
such a promise to you?

282
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,869
What does he know about you?

283
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,051
Why do you think
he made such a promise...

284
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,093
without anything in return?

285
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,512
To go after Nok Du.

286
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,098
I am his best bait.

287
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,478
Even when I yell at him
and run away from him, that fool...

288
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,524
cannot turn his back on me
even if it means he might die.

289
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,747
You are already heartbroken.

290
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,917
And yet, you were going to ruin him?

291
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,337
You?

292
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,722
Father. Father!

293
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,023
- Father.
- Are you...

294
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,067
all right?

295
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,069
It is dangerous here. You must...

296
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,405
run away now.

297
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,325
Father. Father!

298
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,364
Father. Stay here for a moment.

299
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,951
You cannot let him catch you. Okay?

300
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,537
Hwang Tae.

301
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:02,456
Never...

302
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,542
I will come back no matter what.

303
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,711
So you must hang in there.

304
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,817
What are you doing here?

305
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,364
Why did you run away earlier?

306
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,116
I was trying to get out of there,

307
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,744
so he does not take me with him.

308
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,581
Luckily, you found me
just like this.

309
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,890
You must search every corner
to find that jerk.

310
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,814
Put your swords away.

311
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,109
What on earth were you...

312
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,487
- Go after him now!
- Right away!

313
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,420
Are you all right?

314
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,088
I am fine.

315
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,424
How is your arm?

316
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,593
This is nothing.

317
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,930
It will be hard to hold out...

318
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:25,766
with the remaining men
until the backup soldiers arrive.

319
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,653
It is already 11am.

320
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,117
What were you thinking?

321
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,495
Had I not pulled back,
you could have been dead.

322
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,997
Are you trying to kill Nok Du
and start a revolt?

323
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,750
- Is this truly what you wanted?
- Yes.

324
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,503
This way, I could have done
what you wanted all along.

325
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,549
But you know that I do not want
anything from you.

326
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,425
Why not?

327
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,887
Why do you not want
anything from me?

328
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:05,848
I can do everything for you.

329
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,474
I can give you everything. Why not?

330
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,728
Had you...

331
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,192
given your heart to me, I would...

332
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:20,529
You scare me,

333
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,115
and I hate you.

334
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:29,621
What?

335
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,874
I believe you deserve
to be punished.

336
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,335
However,

337
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,047
I feel sorry and pity you as well.

338
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,757
So...

339
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,636
I know it is funny
for me to say this.

340
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,184
But please stop.

341
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,561
Stop this dangerous deed of yours.

342
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,899
I am sincerely pleading to you,
so...

343
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,066
No.

344
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,403
I will see it through.

345
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,992
I will take the throne
and have you by my side.

346
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,539
Did you say that you could not
give me your heart?

347
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,462
I do not need it.

348
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,217
No matter what,
you must stay by my side.

349
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,639
Nok Du will never have you.

350
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:32,226
Because...

351
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,233
I will kill him myself.

352
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:53,997
Take her.

353
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,457
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

354
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,978
Come this way! Retreat!

355
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,897
This way! This way!

356
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,366
Make sure you get every single...

357
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,441
He will never find out...

358
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:04,902
that you were here
or that you had saved his life.

359
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,072
What were you two planning to do?

360
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,909
Were you going to run away?

361
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,912
You tried to kill his father,

362
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,247
and he is the son of the man
who destroyed your family.

363
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,292
You may think it is okay for now,

364
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,960
but you will ultimately
destroy each other.

365
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:23,879
Do you hear me?

366
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,427
- Take her away.
- Yes, my lord.

367
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,482
It is still dangerous outside,
so keep an eye on her.

368
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:44,900
Yes, my lord.

369
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,212
So?

370
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,756
Were you hiding inside,
trembling in fear...

371
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,007
while they were running away?

372
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,302
I did not know what had happened
to the Commandant of Palace Guards.

373
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,639
We have far more men than they do,

374
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,850
so even if they attack once again...

375
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:21,270
Are you saying we should wait
until they strike again?

376
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:22,646
That is not what I meant.

377
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:33,156
I saw all the men fleeing
into the Hall of Convenience.

378
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,909
- The Hall of Convenience?
- Yes, my lord.

379
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,912
I just watched them all go inside.

380
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,082
It is better that
they are all together.

381
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,043
We will attack them
with all the soldiers we have now.

382
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,045
Get the men ready.

383
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,020
Were you running away from me?

384
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,315
Why would I do that?

385
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,820
Let us go
to the Hall of Convenience.

386
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,907
You must witness his death.

387
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,875
I need to go to the toilet.
Will you manage?

388
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:08,961
It is just one woman.

389
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,295
Take your time.

390
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,002
You brought everyone.

391
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,297
How nice of you.

392
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,420
It will be hard to hold out...

393
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,214
with the remaining men
until the backup soldiers arrive.

394
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:08,182
It is already 11am.

395
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,904
Are we a little late Lady Kim?

396
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,387
Go after him right now!

397
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,400
What are you doing here?
Have you gone mad?

398
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:25,611
Why would you get involved in this?

399
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:26,820
I will go wherever...

400
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,114
whether it may be a battlefield
or a place that is burning down.

401
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:30,991
I told you already.

402
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,910
I can no longer live without you.

403
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,751
You finally realized that?

404
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,962
Of course, you cannot
live without me.

405
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,423
I cannot live without you either.

406
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:53,597
So do not worry.

407
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:07,319
I will be back.

408
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,696
Make sure you stay hidden.

409
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:11,782
Do not worry.

410
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,034
Promise me that you will come back.

411
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,037
I promise.

412
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,052
Did you just smile?

413
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:56,512
Fighting you is as exciting...

414
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,306
as I thought it would be.

415
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:02,851
You crazy jerk.

416
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,429
That is... That is enough.

417
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:01,285
My lord! Be careful!

418
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,440
Dan... Dan Ho.

419
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,610
I am sorry,

420
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:18,654
my lord.

421
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:26,537
Dan Ho.

422
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,296
Dan Ho.

423
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,716
I will take revenge
on behalf of Lady Chun.

424
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,689
Stop what you are doing right now!

425
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,049
Drop all your weapons.

426
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:39,628
How...

427
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:57,271
Are the rumors true?

428
00:48:58,021 --> 00:49:00,065
Does His Majesty really have a son
that no one knows about?

429
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:01,984
Yes.

430
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:04,903
I cannot believe
His Majesty died in vain like that.

431
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,739
He should have died
a more painful death.

432
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:09,908
So...

433
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,619
what do you plan to do
about Grand Prince Neungyang?

434
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,748
We cannot let him become the king.

435
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:18,834
Your Majesty.

436
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:21,128
What is it?

437
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:25,883
His... His Majesty is back.

438
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:27,801
What do you mean?

439
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,387
You told me he is dead.

440
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:32,723
Her Highness told me...

441
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,641
I just saw His Majesty...

442
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:37,895
enter the palace gates
along with a group of soldiers.

443
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:41,356
Your Majesty,
you must move somewhere else...

444
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,609
I would like to meet His Majesty.

445
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,140
It seems like they are
at the Hall of Convenience.

446
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:20,562
Your Majesty.

447
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:25,442
You should be at the West Palace.

448
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:27,069
Why are you here?

449
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,320
I was dragged here.

450
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:30,948
He came to the West Palace
all of a sudden.

451
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:33,951
And he coerced me to justify
the revolt they plotted.

452
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,118
Who did?

453
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:53,637
You were just about
to achieve your goal.

454
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,182
I must have interrupted you.

455
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:29,047
I asked you who came to you
and plotted treason against me.

456
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,177
I have never seen him before.

457
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,221
I thought it was absurd,

458
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:39,850
but he said he was your son.

459
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,543
You asked me once
if I abandoned you...

460
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,129
because of what I heard
from the fortune-teller.

461
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:12,925
Yes, that was why.

462
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:14,968
Not only did I abandon you,

463
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,221
but I also killed the woman who
uttered such words and her daughter.

464
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:20,015
I ordered my men
to kill Yun Jeo as well.

465
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:25,896
Do not look at me that way.

466
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,565
I did what I ought to do.

467
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:30,943
Look.

468
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:34,154
Just as predicted, you coveted
my throne and tried to steal it.

469
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:39,076
And you declared that I was dead
when I was not.

470
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,545
Do you wish to deny it?

471
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:52,589
Tell me what you were doing here...

472
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:55,050
unless you were trying
to start a revolt against me.

473
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:58,512
Why did you hide your identity
and stay by my side?

474
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:00,889
Why did you make me trust you...

475
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,478
and confide everything in you?

476
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:09,147
I abandoned you.

477
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:12,734
I tried to kill you countless times!

478
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:17,155
You must have despised me to death.

479
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:20,909
Is that not true?

480
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:30,961
I asked if that was not true.

481
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:33,547
Yes,

482
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:35,507
that is true.

483
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,051
I hate you.

484
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:41,013
I resent you to death.

485
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:45,767
Yes. You probably did.

486
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:47,644
That must be why...

487
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:51,023
you plotted
an awful revolt like this.

488
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,204
Please forgive me.

489
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:11,585
I tried to stop him
after finding out what he was up to.

490
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,337
But he...

491
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,216
stirred up the men
with a hideous lie...

492
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:19,051
that you passed away.

493
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,219
That is not true.

494
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:24,556
Grand Prince Neungyang is the one
who led the revolt.

495
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,475
Nok Du...

496
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,852
My brother was trying to stop him.

497
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,062
Do not listen to him.

498
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:33,732
He deceived me and conspired
with his brother to help the revolt.

499
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,235
You stayed by my side
to deceive me...

500
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:38,445
and to take revenge against me.

501
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,787
You have prepared a lot.

502
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:48,872
Right.

503
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:55,045
You will not believe anything I say.

504
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,510
Get rid of all the people
who may cause trouble later.

505
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:03,470
And make sure the rest stay silent.

506
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,889
Are you certain
that this could work?

507
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:09,685
His Majesty will not believe
his son anyway.

508
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,813
If anyone sides with his son,

509
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:15,858
that will be considered treason
as well.

510
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:19,152
No one will risk their life
to tell the truth.

511
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:26,034
For a son who was abandoned
by his own father.

512
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:39,965
Will you believe me...

513
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:42,092
if I was actually trying to stop
Grand Prince Neungyang's revolt?

514
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:46,430
If I say that I was happy
and scared at the same time...

515
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,224
without knowing
how you felt about me...

516
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,771
when I stayed by your side,
would you believe me?

517
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:01,820
You will not believe anything...

518
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:04,031
except for
that I tried to take your throne.

519
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,789
Did you truly...

520
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,293
try to take my throne?

521
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,338
Have I hurt you?

522
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,010
What?

523
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,476
You trusted me
and kept me by your side.

524
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:35,687
But I hid my identity
and plotted treason.

525
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:37,648
Did that hurt you?

526
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,025
Are you...

527
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,736
trying to...

528
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,948
look down on me again?

529
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,325
You had no idea,

530
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,372
and you trusted me like a fool.

531
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,541
Do you hate yourself for that?

532
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,295
Are you heartbroken
by the sense of betrayal?

533
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,631
Are you in pain?

534
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:06,969
- How dare you?
- Just like how I felt...

535
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:11,932
when you abandoned me.

536
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,570
If so,

537
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:29,324
I will give you
the answer you want. Yes.

538
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,952
I wanted to drag you down
from your throne...

539
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:33,662
myself.

540
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:38,166
I decided that I was going
to kill you myself.

541
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:42,337
Are you satisfied with my answer?

542
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:49,636
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

543
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,770
The culprit has confessed
to his crime.

544
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:01,940
Arrest him immediately.

545
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:04,776
- Arrest him!
- Right away.

546
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:23,921
Protect His Majesty!

547
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:24,922
- Right away!
- Right away!

548
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:26,173
We must go, Your Majesty.

549
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:28,467
Let us go.

550
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,851
We will buy you time.
Get him out of here now.

551
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,895
We will follow you right away.
Do not worry.

552
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,855
I like you so much
that I am about to lose my mind.

553
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,168
Do you know...

554
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:28,629
who I am?

555
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:41,350
It is not your fault.

556
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,401
(Next Monday,)

557
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:59,034
(Nok Du and Dong Joo's
last story will unfold.)
