(in this drama are fictitious.)

5
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,773
Widows?

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,568
The assassins who tried to kill
the local functionary were women?

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,237
Yes.

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,032
I am certain that one of them...

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,868
was wearing mourning clothes.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,373
Are you sure?

11
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,458
How could women...

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,460
I definitely saw them.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,259
They were not
just regular assassins. They were...

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,552
Hey.

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,303
Hey.

16
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,107
Where is Yun?

17
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,359
I was informed that he went
to a gisaeng house he frequents.

18
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,237
- A gisaeng house?
- Yes.

19
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,656
It is called Yeonhwa House
in Mudam Valley.

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,075
Okay.

21
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,536
Take care of the body.

22
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,037
Yes, Your Majesty.

23
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,378
Right. That is where the village
for widows is, is it not?

24
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,588
Pardon?

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,341
Come to think of it,

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,676
the village for widows
is next to the gisaeng house.

27
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,110
Welcome.

28
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,946
We are not here as your customers.

29
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,365
We need to search the place quietly,
so cooperate.

30
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,867
Okay.

31
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,702
Let us not complicate things.

32
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,330
Do not let Prince Yeongchang...

33
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,582
who is young and weak
take the throne.

34
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,793
Instead,

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,131
help me take the throne.

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,009
That is the only change
in your plan.

37
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,416
So you want to become a king?

38
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,128
Do you think you have
what it takes to be a king?

39
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,624
Is he one of them?

40
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,670
No.

41
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,298
If he is one of them,
he would not be dressed like that.

42
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,931
What are you doing?

43
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,767
This village for widows
is protected by the King.

44
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,769
Men are forbidden here.

45
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,064
You ought to be rolled
and taught a lesson!

46
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,066
Oh, my!

47
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,402
Are you here to catch
your daughter-in-law who ran away?

48
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,697
Then you should back off even more.

49
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,286
You are hiding something in there.

50
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,795
Goodness.

51
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,048
What are you doing to a weak woman?

52
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,842
What could I be hiding?

53
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,015
How may I help you?

54
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,670
Lord Heo Yun stopped
by the gisaeng house for a bit.

55
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,964
There was no one suspicious.

56
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,939
Good work, everyone.

57
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,150
You bought us some time,

58
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,693
so we were able to dodge a bullet.

59
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,904
When we were
after the local functionary,

60
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,073
she seemed to be good at fighting.

61
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,991
But I believe she is smart as well.

62
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,288
I think I can assign you missions
from now on.

63
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,707
I will do my best.

64
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,299
By the way, who is he?

65
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,142
Why did you bring me here?

66
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,273
Even you, the Chancellor
of Special Counselors,

67
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,275
can do nothing.

68
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,070
I had thought
you had the King's trust.

69
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,658
But he caught up to you.

70
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,496
Thanks to you,
Prince Yeongchang has died.

71
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,581
Even if the King finds out,

72
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,583
the situation
will not get any worse.

73
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,169
We have lost our purpose.

74
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,379
What do you mean?

75
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,007
Did you not hear what I said?

76
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,801
You must make me the king.

77
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,347
Why do you want to take the throne?

78
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,563
I have always wished
that our poor people...

79
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,481
would have enough to eat...

80
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,067
and live good lives.

81
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,782
Do you really need me
to say such things?

82
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,952
You need to deeply care
about your people!

83
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,956
I am...

84
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,210
going to become a king...

85
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,129
who is invincible.

86
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,091
And you can serve me.

87
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,969
Are you going to inform the King?

88
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,348
Will you tell him that you had once
considered betraying him?

89
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,558
Or...

90
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,394
will you tell him that his son,

91
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,397
who should have died
20 years ago,

92
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,858
is still alive?

93
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,278
Will you make a tearful confession?

94
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,366
Let me answer your question...

95
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,785
about why I brought you here.

96
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,162
Come in.

97
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,430
While keeping my eyes on you,
I had an unexpected gain.

98
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,695
When I heard that the Muweol Corps
was sent to an island,

99
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,073
I wondered what there could be.

100
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,994
I found some people...

101
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,872
who had been in hiding
for a very long time.

102
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,332
That was when I knew...

103
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,211
that the stories
my father had told me...

104
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,463
were true.

105
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,550
Were you not curious?

106
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,512
Why do you think
the King wanted to kill...

107
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,807
his own son and Jung Yun Jeo?

108
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,395
You are probably still alive...

109
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,898
since you were not curious
about that.

110
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,858
Are you...

111
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,110
Had I been the son of the King,

112
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,529
I would not have felt wronged...

113
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,489
about having to live in hiding
for all my life.

114
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,161
You must be Yun Jeo's son.

115
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,245
I will see to it...

116
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,165
that he becomes the king.

117
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,959
He is the only man
who will bring back everything...

118
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,836
that I have lost.

119
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,093
All right, then. What do you say?

120
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,846
Usually, sharing
such deep secrets...

121
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,057
would bring together
the individuals involved.

122
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,291
- You cannot come in here.
- No, it is okay.

123
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,043
I am allowed to do that.

124
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,420
What?

125
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,841
I can go wherever I please
and kill whomever I want.

126
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,094
I am allowed to do that.

127
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,223
What do you mean?

128
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,641
I have finally found out...

129
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,102
whom you have feelings for.

130
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,897
Are you talking about that again?

131
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,482
I told you that it is not...

132
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:33,819
If that is true,
will you be okay if I kill him?

133
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,729
I am going to leave soon.

134
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,691
I just used him.

135
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,068
I have always been sorry...

136
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,780
towards Lady Chun for taking me in.

137
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,784
But thanks to him,
the burden I had was lifted.

138
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,915
You used him?

139
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,333
Yes.

140
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,627
Just like how you are being rude...

141
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,837
solely because you found out
who I was,

142
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,049
I found his weakness
and used it against him.

143
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,135
So do not assume
such a ridiculous thing...

144
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,096
or make such heinous comments.

145
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,436
All right.

146
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,731
Leave this place and come to me.
Then I will be...

147
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:53,815
No.

148
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,903
I do not want to hear it.

149
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,031
Please leave.

150
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,921
What? What is it?

151
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,346
Why did you accuse
an innocent man of being a pervert?

152
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,432
Where and what were you doing
after that?

153
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,771
Why did you come here?

154
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,235
- I do not want to talk about it.
- What?

155
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,279
You said
you would tell me everything.

156
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,488
I thought you were not interested.

157
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,074
You told me not to ask questions
and to mind my own business.

158
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,534
On top of that, you are going to...

159
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,452
I am going to leave soon.

160
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,747
I just used him.

161
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,877
What were you going to say?

162
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,003
Forget it.

163
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,505
Finish your sentence.

164
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,632
Stop being so secretive
and answer my question.

165
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,555
Why do I have to be the only one
who tells you everything?

166
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,473
What about you? What is your story?

167
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,392
Why are you suddenly
asking about me?

168
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,477
We are talking about you
because you acted peculiar.

169
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,314
What does that have anything
to do with you?

170
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,648
You little...

171
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,525
- What...
- My goodness, that is enough.

172
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,153
My gosh. Seriously.

173
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,993
My goodness.

174
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,953
Are you guys kids?

175
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,371
Are you?

176
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,624
If you have something
to argue about,

177
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,543
you should calmly
talk about it like adults.

178
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,713
The day has just started,
but you are ruining the mood.

179
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,635
What? Hey, Aeng Du.

180
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,304
Can you ask her where she is going
without doing the dishes?

181
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,515
He wants to know
where you are going.

182
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,807
I am going to earn money.

183
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,436
And tell him that it is his job
to do the dishes.

184
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,813
She says it is your responsibility.

185
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,232
Do not go.

186
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,900
Do you...

187
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,485
Do you even know
what kind of guy he is?

188
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,529
I live with you, but I do not
even know who you are.

189
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,155
So how would I know anything
about him?

190
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,950
Anyway, do not go.

191
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,451
Do not go.

192
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,078
Who are you to tell me what to do?

193
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,246
Me? I am...

194
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,749
your mother. I am your mother.

195
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,502
My gosh, tell him he must be
very proud of himself.

196
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,087
You guys are driving me crazy.

197
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,590
You will not even
let me eat in peace.

198
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:29,596
But you finished your meal.

199
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,599
You guys are so immature.

200
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,352
I cannot stand this childish act.

201
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,563
Hey, where are you going?

202
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,274
I am on my way to see Lord Yul Mu.

203
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,234
Why would you go there?

204
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,611
I need to eat lunch...

205
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,280
now that I have finished breakfast.

206
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,452
My gosh, come on.

207
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,288
Darn it!

208
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,672
Where is Lord Yul Mu?

209
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,674
He must not have come.

210
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,594
He goes to dozens of gisaeng houses.

211
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,681
This is good. I can use this chance
to wash the dishes.

212
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,183
What about lunch?

213
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,018
What about my lunch?

214
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,103
He promised that he would
cook flower pancakes for me.

215
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,148
He also said
that he would take me on a picnic.

216
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,276
He told me
that flower pancakes taste best...

217
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,861
when we eat it outside on a picnic.

218
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,779
He promised me.

219
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,825
My gosh, I will make it for you.

220
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,621
My goodness, are you sure
you can make them taste good?

221
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,122
I am not confident.

222
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,540
How am I going to face His Majesty?

223
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,167
Just act normal.

224
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,878
He must be more suspicious now.

225
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,171
What should we do?

226
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,215
We are going to move the base
for the Muweol Corps.

227
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,091
Tell everyone to stop
going to Yeonhwa House,

228
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,427
and tell them they should
also be careful not to get caught.

229
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,931
How about we just accept
Grand Prince Neungyang's offer...

230
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,767
Everyone thinks
it is a good alternative.

231
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,185
Prince Yeongchang
is no longer alive.

232
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,728
So we must come up with a solution.

233
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,897
I will come up
with another solution.

234
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,566
He can never be the next king.

235
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,290
Tomorrow,

236
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,669
the Muweol Corps
will have to leave the village.

237
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,878
- What?
- What?

238
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,048
Make sure you do not leave
any traces behind.

239
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,301
And form a group of 3 to 4 people
and leave the village after sunset.

240
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,096
Let us all meet
at Aseowon in Hanyang.

241
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,056
Who gave us this order?

242
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,016
Is it Lord Heo's order?

243
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,352
Yes, I got a letter from him.

244
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,021
But did you forget
what happened yesterday?

245
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,982
Does he have
any power left in him at all?

246
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,692
Why is it that we always...

247
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,944
have to change
the people we serve?

248
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,904
Lord Yul Mu...

249
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,073
I mean...

250
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,327
Grand Prince Neungyang has been
planning everything all along.

251
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,329
Now that he has power,

252
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,498
we have no other choice.

253
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,376
If we refuse,
everyone will be put in danger.

254
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,754
However,

255
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,300
he is also someone
who can fulfill our wish.

256
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,929
The chancellor will soon
come to an agreement with him,

257
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,348
so we are not betraying anyone.

258
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,977
We just need to trust both of them
and follow their lead.

259
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,688
Neither of them seems any different.

260
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,148
I am going to meet
Grand Prince Neungyang tomorrow...

261
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,816
and settle the situation.

262
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,404
But I also think it is right
to move our base.

263
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,282
I will escort you to Hanyang.

264
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,243
I want you to stay here
and help the others leave.

265
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,495
Meanwhile,

266
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,958
Lady Kim can stay with me.

267
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,002
Okay.

268
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,353
Are you really going to go?

269
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,022
We are talking about the chancellor
and the King's cousin.

270
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,191
We should just stop here.

271
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,485
Let us go back to your father and...

272
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,653
And do what?

273
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,489
Are we going to hide
in the mountains this time?

274
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,326
My goodness gracious.

275
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,621
A group of high officials gathered
together to start a new world...

276
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,122
behind His Majesty's back.

277
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,960
Do you even know what that means?

278
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,753
A conspiracy.

279
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,588
You know that...

280
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,592
You know that and you are still
willing to go? What is your plan?

281
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,302
They are already doing it,

282
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,304
so that means my dad
is not guilty of treason.

283
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,226
I barely found their weakness
by dressing up as a woman.

284
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,477
I should use it to my own advantage.

285
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,145
If things go bad,

286
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,607
I will just report those traitors
to the police bureau.

287
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,485
My gosh.

288
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,154
I do not care
if I have to kill them or not.

289
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,156
I am going to put an end to this.

290
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,784
Then we will no longer have to hide.

291
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,246
My father, brother,

292
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,376
and...

293
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,713
I am going to leave soon.

294
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,632
And...

295
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,428
Okay.

296
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,600
We will continue to live with you.

297
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:25,726
We will stop hiding.

298
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,102
Let us do that.

299
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,729
Okay, let us do that.

300
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,939
Yes, of course.

301
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,859
I will live with you and Aeng Du.

302
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,485
Yes, without a doubt.

303
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,660
You are unbelievable.

304
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,787
You are supposed to use
glutinous rice powder water.

305
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,081
I cannot believe
you threw the soaked rice cakes...

306
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,457
right into the pot of oil.

307
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,209
I thought it would be similar.

308
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,628
Frying things in oil
are pretty much the same.

309
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,754
My gosh.

310
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,798
I am hungry.

311
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,508
Can you cook it for me?

312
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,426
I am busy. Forget it.

313
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,557
Lord Yul Mu would have
made them for me.

314
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,359
That is enough.
Let us get going soon.

315
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,111
- Go where?
- Go where?

316
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,404
You said that
you would make flower pancakes...

317
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,738
and go on a picnic with me.

318
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:02,906
When did I promise you that?

319
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,575
I told you that I am busy.

320
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,370
Lord Yul Mu would have...

321
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,956
Fine, let us go.

322
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,900
Eat up.

323
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,319
Are you protecting me?

324
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,988
Or are you keeping me
locked in this room?

325
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,871
I am keeping you here
so I can protect you.

326
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,333
I have no time to waste.

327
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,418
I need to find my sons.

328
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,171
I will ask my men
to do their best...

329
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,507
to find your firstborn.

330
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,676
If they cannot find his body,
that means he is hiding somewhere.

331
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,015
Please make sure
that you find him for me.

332
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,809
As for His Majesty's son...

333
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:17,314
If I happen to find him...

334
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,857
We will go to Ming.

335
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,817
If you want us to go somewhere
further away, we will do that.

336
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,694
We will go where you tell us to go.

337
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:25,781
You told me he grew up to be
a smart and righteous man, right?

338
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,911
Maybe he could be my alternative.

339
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,872
What do you mean by that?

340
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,625
No, it is nothing.

341
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,919
I will find him.

342
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,088
I just need you
to stay here quietly.

343
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,842
No one will get hurt,
so do not worry.

344
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,832
Why are you wearing a man's outfit
all of a sudden?

345
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,876
Why not? We climbed over the valley
and are far from the house.

346
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,961
This is great.
Look how handsome I look in this.

347
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,337
Here.

348
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:28,969
Handsome, my foot.

349
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,573
Forget it. You do not even know
how to fish.

350
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,116
Look who is talking.

351
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,493
You have not caught a fish
for an hour either.

352
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,537
So we should just head back.

353
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,206
Why did you drag me here?

354
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,374
Do you think
I wanted to bring you here?

355
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,044
Had you not started cooking
this flower pancake...

356
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,337
I said I would make pancakes.

357
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,172
I never talked
about going on a picnic.

358
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,382
Anyway, this is all your fault.

359
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,052
You should not have gone
to that kitchen, to begin with.

360
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:11,470
And why do you think I went...

361
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,055
And that jerk is the worst.

362
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,224
If he made a promise to her,
he should keep his promise.

363
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,559
If he could not keep his promise,
he should have not made it.

364
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,478
Goodness.

365
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,438
Goodness.

366
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,857
You two will end up getting attached
to one another at this rate.

367
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,151
Why do you keep fighting?

368
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,070
This is not that big of a deal.

369
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:31,073
It is because he has
a lot of secrets.

370
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,991
He said he would tell me,
but he never did.

371
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,998
It is because I do not wish
to lie to you. So what?

372
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,667
What?

373
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,795
I cannot tell you...

374
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,713
why I came here. Not now.

375
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,591
I will have to lie to you
if I tell you why.

376
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,261
And I do not wish to do that.
Happy now?

377
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:02,312
I am sorry to interrupt
your serious conversation.

378
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:06,316
You need to turn the boat around.

379
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,075
Gosh, I can breathe again.

380
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:20,747
Well, can you look for a leaf?

381
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,625
Find a soft one for me. Okay?

382
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,764
Hey, hey.

383
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,267
What? Where are you going?

384
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,351
Hey.

385
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,812
Hey! Hey!

386
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,775
Hey!

387
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,487
Hey.

388
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,408
Hey!

389
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,660
Hey.

390
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,663
Hey.

391
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,922
Did you see that? I do not need
that darn fishing rod to catch...

392
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,261
Darn it. Hey.

393
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:19,515
Hey, what is wrong with you?

394
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,268
Come on. Darn it.

395
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,913
Why did you not tell her
that you lived on an island?

396
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,164
She never asked.

397
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,794
Darn it.

398
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,398
Aeng Du.

399
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:11,859
Eat this.

400
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:13,277
Eat it over there.

401
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,032
What?

402
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:21,702
Are you that dumb?

403
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,579
You should have dried
your feet first.

404
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,163
Forget it. Let us just go.

405
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,416
If your feet are cold,
you will catch a cold.

406
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,834
You will make my life harder
if you do.

407
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,354
There.

408
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:50,898
All done.

409
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,069
- I told you...
- Not to do stuff like this for you.

410
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:58,655
I will do whatever I want.

411
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,574
It is not like
you listen to me either.

412
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,118
It is not that.

413
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,164
I do not know your real name.

414
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,792
What?

415
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,712
When I thought that
you fell into the water earlier,

416
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,006
I could not call you...

417
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:17,758
because I did not know your name.

418
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:22,804
Do you want me to tell you?

419
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,474
I do not want to.

420
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,478
Is your name that precious
to share with me?

421
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:30,812
I will tell you later...

422
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:34,233
if you take good care
of Dong Dong and Dong Joo.

423
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,818
I will tell you once they grow
their cockscomb, lay eggs,

424
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,195
and become chickens.

425
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,033
Your answer is always "later".

426
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:45,369
Forget it.

427
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,704
I will tell you then,

428
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,165
so you should stay with them
and raise them well.

429
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,084
They need you.

430
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,294
You are their owner. Okay?

431
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,591
Promise me that you will do so.

432
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,934
I will keep addressing you
as a jerk then.

433
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:13,647
Hey, why are you always so harsh?

434
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,566
My request is not that hard
to comply with.

435
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:18,151
Promise me. You will not promise?

436
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:22,865
Gosh.

437
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,451
(The Muweol Corps must leave.
Do not leave any traces behind.)

438
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,079
The chancellor is indeed naive.

439
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,832
The only solution
he could come up with...

440
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,752
was sending the Muweol Corps
to Hanyang.

441
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,463
However, the King has his eyes
on this place.

442
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,633
So it will be dangerous for them
to stay here.

443
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,677
If you also visit our house...

444
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,138
I have been visiting
this gisaeng house every day.

445
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,974
Stop coming here
would draw more attention.

446
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,060
Then, what should we...

447
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,854
Follow the chancellor's instruction.

448
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,149
We will.

449
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,569
I will go to Hanyang
as soon as dawn breaks.

450
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,030
I have a few questions
for the chancellor as well.

451
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,074
I am going to ask him...

452
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:10,245
to follow the current.

453
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,458
I will provide guards and horses.

454
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,043
That is all right.

455
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,588
I will go to Hanyang with a widow
who just joined the Muweol Corps.

456
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,468
And I believe you have met her too.

457
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:26,803
I do?

458
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,563
Your Majesty.

459
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:40,859
I am the vice-curator
in charge...

460
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,611
of the village for widows
at Mudam Valley.

461
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,404
- My name...
- That is enough.

462
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,241
Tell me
about the village for widows.

463
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,785
Tell me everything even if
it does not seem suspicious.

464
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,704
You can only go home
if your answers satisfy me.

465
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,498
Yes.

466
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,482
I heard you joined the Muweol Corps.

467
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,860
They said they would pay me.

468
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,113
I heard
you are preparing to commit treason.

469
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:38,500
I am sparing your life even though
you ought to be dead...

470
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,752
because Dong Joo asked me to.

471
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,797
But it is getting difficult.

472
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,300
I am starting to want
to break my promise I made to her.

473
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,512
I am not intimidated
by a man who is all talk.

474
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:53,849
Well, do as you please.

475
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:57,102
Do not sway her.

476
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,147
I will make it brief.

477
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,684
Hey. I lost him because of you.

478
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,186
Who are you?

479
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,814
Wait. Are you not...

480
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,861
Thank goodness I did not promise...

481
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,782
that I would stay beside him
until the chicks grew up.

482
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,298
But I want to.

483
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,012
I want to stay by his side.

484
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,391
I am sorry, Mom.

485
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:30,988
Her belongings are still here.

486
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,699
It cannot be.

487
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,367
No.

488
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,710
What is this?

489
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,672
- What?
- How could you go without telling?

490
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,425
- Where have you been?
- You disappeared too.

491
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,721
Hwa Su asked for my help,
so I was at her place.

492
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,764
Do you think I did not check?

493
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,937
It looks like you are planning
to go somewhere.

494
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,024
Leave and let me sleep.

495
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,882
I will not ask you to like me.

496
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,760
You can use me if you want.
I am fine with that.

497
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:36,678
So...

498
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:41,600
Please do not disappear on me.

499
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,771
I am begging you.

500
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,755
Is it okay for you
not to be disguised?

501
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,007
Have you not heard?

502
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,927
Lord Heo is behind me.

503
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:18,637
What?

504
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:24,017
That is why it would be natural
to visit him like this.

505
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,061
We are here.

506
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,728
Are you leaving today?

507
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,355
Yes.

508
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,902
Are you hurrying...

509
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,779
because of him?

510
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,825
I am leaving because I am ready.

511
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:23,785
All right.

512
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,704
Let us go to Hanyang together.

513
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,790
I will go alone.
Please do not follow me.

514
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,335
Fine.

515
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,713
But I must check to see
if you have arrived safely.

516
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,673
Do you remember where the swing was?

517
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,842
Show me your face anytime
between 9pm and 11pm.

518
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,135
That is all that I ask.

519
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,473
If I do that,

520
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,185
will you not do anything?

521
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,898
Are you talking about him?

522
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,150
Yes.

523
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,654
Promise me that
you will never harm him.

524
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,906
And yet, you tell me
that you do not like him?

525
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,667
Even if I do, I will hide
my feelings.

526
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,920
I will leave without saying anything
and hurt him.

527
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,839
That way, he will despise me.

528
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,761
That will be better...

529
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,097
than my dying...

530
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,099
and his losing me.

531
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,811
I know very well...

532
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:34,273
how it feels to lose someone
you love so dearly...

533
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:37,150
and to continue on living.

534
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,905
I will not let that happen.

535
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,159
So you do not need to worry about...

536
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,378
You are crying.

537
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,632
And it is because of him.

538
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,516
You are not warning me.

539
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,271
You are confessing your feelings
for him.

540
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,693
Please pay me for everything
I have worked for you.

541
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:21,945
No.

542
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,867
I will pay you in Hanyang.
Do not be late.

543
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,252
Thank you.

544
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:49,515
I am alive.

545
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,809
A gisaeng house
provides for the village...

546
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,062
Bring in their boss...

547
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,774
and the widows
who are close to her.

548
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,362
If there is no evidence

549
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,447
bring in witnesses.

550
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,032
Yes, Your Majesty.

551
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,054
Has everyone escaped?

552
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:30,472
Yes.

553
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,598
They have.

554
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,226
And Lady Kim has left
with Lady Chun already.

555
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,727
So we are the last ones.

556
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:37,980
My house...

557
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,233
and my friends are all there.

558
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:45,445
I did those cold-blooded deeds
so that I could live there in peace.

559
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:48,657
We need to leave...

560
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,159
to keep our friends safe.

561
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,463
Let us go.

562
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:11,889
- All right.
- Pour me a cup.

563
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,850
This is nice. All right.

564
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:20,397
There he comes.

565
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,408
Let us move.

566
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:32,910
- Let us go!
- Let us go!

567
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,370
- Let us go!
- Let us go!

568
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:38,081
Come on!

569
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,752
Why do you not...

570
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,464
yield yourself?

571
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:50,469
He promised that he would take care
of people like us...

572
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,346
who are powerless.

573
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,014
If so,

574
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:57,893
is he not better
than the current King?

575
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:07,528
I wonder if you will think the same
after seeing this.

576
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,868
This is Lady Min's...

577
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:17,913
We found her dead body
on the mountain behind the village.

578
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:20,707
And we have recently found out
who killed her.

579
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,299
Are you saying
Grand Prince Neungyang did this?

580
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:31,593
Why?

581
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,512
So he could dig up whatever
he needed to know about me,

582
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:36,598
find my weakness,
and eventually threaten me with it.

583
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,434
You think he will care for the weak?

584
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,691
He is a man who can kill anyone...

585
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,570
in order to get what he wants.

586
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:04,019
Grand Prince Neungyang is
provoking us to make the first move.

587
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:06,647
He is very much prepared,
so you must be careful.

588
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,857
Should we find him and kill him?

589
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,443
He did nothing wrong.

590
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,946
He had to hide and live on an island
because of his father.

591
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,615
Bring him back alive.

592
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,035
"An island"?
Are they talking about my brother?

593
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,872
Is it a bit uncomfortable
to be friends?

594
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:07,291
I thought it would be nice
for us to be friends.

595
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,751
I am sure we will
slowly become friends.

596
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:13,213
Yes, of course. We will be
working together for a long time.

597
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,592
Am I of any help to your plan?

598
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,927
I would not keep you around
if you were useless.

599
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,512
There is something...

600
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:24,183
I need you to help me with,
but that is not part of my plan.

601
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,353
Your younger brother... I mean...

602
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,650
I need to find His Majesty's son.

603
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:07,059
Are you going to kill him
if I find him for you?

604
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:11,980
Well...

605
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:17,236
I am thinking of killing him
because he is useless to me.

606
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,489
But what do you think?

607
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:23,700
I am also willing
to follow your opinion.

608
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:42,553
Hwang Tae.

609
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:48,475
How did you get caught?

610
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:49,768
Did you get hurt?

611
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:51,687
Are you okay?

612
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:55,983
You must have been through a lot.

613
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:57,943
I missed you, Hwang Tae.

614
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:01,822
How did you get here?

615
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:05,701
Well, it is a long story.

616
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,953
But I came to save you.
Let us get out of here.

617
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,037
No.

618
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,207
I am not here because I got caught.

619
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:13,834
What?

620
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,713
I thought you got caught
by Grand Prince Neungyang.

621
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:19,590
I thought you were running...

622
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:20,591
from the person
who tried to kill us...

623
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,634
We almost got killed
on the island...

624
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:25,846
because of you.

625
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,267
- Hwang Tae.
- Grand Prince Neungyang...

626
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,686
saved me right when I was about
to get killed because of you again.

627
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:35,772
What are you talking about?

628
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,693
The reason we had to hide,

629
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,196
the reason why my mother had to die
such a pitiful death,

630
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,364
and the reason why
we had to get chased all the time...

631
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:49,411
I found out why.

632
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,413
Was it because of me?

633
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,624
Yes, it was all because of you.

634
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:58,795
Never mind.

635
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:00,672
Forget it. You should go.

636
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,133
I will not tell anyone
that I saw you today, so get going.

637
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:04,843
Why was it my fault?

638
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,470
Why?

639
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,096
Tell me.

640
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,765
Tell me!

641
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,476
Do you really want to hear it?

642
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,354
Are you sure you can handle it?

643
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:21,360
Tell me.

644
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:23,695
Fine.

645
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:28,158
This is all because of you.

646
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,912
This is...

647
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,332
This is all because...

648
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:37,876
This is all because...

649
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,675
you are the son...

650
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,095
of His Majesty.

651
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:22,838
Do not kill him.

652
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,014
We need someone to go back
and tell Lord Heo...

653
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:34,016
not to waste his energy.

654
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,102
That is nonsense.

655
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,272
You expect me to believe that?

656
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:43,358
You expect me to believe
that I am His Majesty's son?

657
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,153
If you cannot believe me,

658
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:49,031
you should go ahead
and ask His Majesty yourself.

659
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:50,699
What is the matter with you?

660
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,368
I am your younger brother.

661
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:54,578
I am my father's son.

662
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:56,205
That is what I also thought!

663
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:58,582
That is why...

664
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,418
That is why I lived
such a difficult life.

665
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:03,420
Mother.

666
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:06,173
Hwang Tae! Come on in here!

667
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,384
- Mother!
- It is all your fault.

668
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,720
Had it not been for you,

669
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,388
my son would have...

670
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,475
My family would have...

671
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,478
I am no longer
going to live that way.

672
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:22,689
I am going to retrieve everything
I had lost...

673
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,317
because of you.

674
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:29,905
Hwang Tae.

675
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:32,950
Please do not do this.

676
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:35,827
Let us leave together.

677
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,747
You cannot abandon me like this.

678
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:40,749
What am I supposed to do now?

679
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,751
Run away by yourself.

680
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:46,129
This is all I know,
so do not come looking for me again.

681
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,881
Do not try to know anything.

682
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,551
Hide and live like you do not exist.

683
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:53,595
If you do not do that,

684
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:57,766
you will surely die.

685
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:01,478
Get out of here. Leave.

686
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:03,063
Leave right now!

687
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:07,317
Brother.

688
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:09,486
Do not call me that...

689
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,573
anymore.

690
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,657
Did anything happen?

691
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,285
The alcohol got me
feeling a little sentimental.

692
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:03,290
What is going on outside?

693
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,459
It is nothing.

694
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:10,506
It has been taken care of.
Do not worry, and rest.

695
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,133
I have another appointment.
Goodnight.

696
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:09,898
You are here.

697
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,567
But...

698
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,862
I could not find Lady Kim,
so I came here alone.

699
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:16,655
I needed to ask you something.

700
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:17,823
You could not find her?

701
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:20,784
Okay. Go inside.

702
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:21,910
I need to step outside for a moment.

703
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:23,912
Did you kill Lady Min?

704
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:35,632
Yes.

705
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,719
I killed her
in order to keep a secret.

706
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:41,221
I got rid of a possibility
that may cause trouble later.

707
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:43,265
Is there something wrong with that?

708
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,767
In case of trouble in the future,

709
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:49,521
you killed a woman
who risked her life to do her duty?

710
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:50,939
It is only natural for someone...

711
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,900
who has served her purpose
to disappear. Do you not agree?

712
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,235
In that case, you might abandon
the Muweol Corps...

713
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,404
and the village for widows
whenever you want.

714
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,781
You can make sure
I do not abandon them.

715
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,116
And as for the village for widows,

716
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:04,870
I have already abandoned it.

717
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,635
Let us go!

718
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,601
If you need a village,
I can build another one.

719
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,228
If you want a gisaeng house,
I will make...

720
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,271
the biggest and the fanciest one
in Hanyang.

721
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,358
Please do not tell me you thought...

722
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,694
taking the Muweol Corps
out of the village...

723
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:39,780
would solve this.

724
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:43,617
You must have thought
little of the King.

725
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:47,704
Please give me some time.

726
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:48,914
I will make sure...

727
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,750
no one becomes evidence
for the King.

728
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,962
I can move the whole village
somewhere else if necessary.

729
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,046
Why?

730
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,924
- Pardon?
- Why must I do that?

731
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,050
It is a hassle...

732
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:01,552
when I know a very simple way...

733
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,012
that guarantees what I want.

734
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:13,647
I understand now.

735
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:14,731
I am glad.

736
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:17,484
Wait for me in the room.

737
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,279
And tell Dan Ho to find Lady Kim.

738
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,407
Yes, my lord.

739
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:45,637
Did you catch him?

740
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:50,309
Who are you?

741
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,687
My father, my brother, and me.

742
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:55,814
Why did you try to kill us?

743
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,775
Who on earth am I?

744
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:00,694
Answer me.

745
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:05,407
- Are you...
- My lord! Lord Heo!

746
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,451
The village for widows is in danger.

747
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:23,634
Let us begin!

748
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,594
- Yes!
- Let us start.

749
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,431
- Oh, no.
- What?

750
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,727
- There is a fire!
- Fire!

751
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,244
Do not miss anyone.

752
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:56,708
- What is going on?
- Darn it.

753
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:59,021
There were rice cake and meat in it.

754
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,316
Anyway, it was really good.

755
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:06,361
I have never heard of a place
that sells that dish.

756
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:09,573
My gosh, this is frustrating.

757
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:13,285
I am certain this is the place.
I am certain of it.

758
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,663
Hey, just eat some food and go.

759
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,916
You will see a tiger later
if you stay out.

760
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:20,542
That is all right.

761
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:23,712
We can spend the night here.

762
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:28,717
With this, we can spend
10 nights here.

763
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,805
She is talking a bunch of nonsense.

764
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,517
Why did he tell her to eat something
that does not exist?

765
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,809
Gosh, this is annoying.

766
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:41,563
But she has a lot of money with her.

767
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,443
Kill everyone!

768
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:00,832
Kill all of them.

769
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:05,462
(Brewery)

770
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,766
That is our village.

771
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,101
Fire...

772
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,294
How dare you?

773
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,856
Lady Kang, what is going on?

774
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,525
I do not know.

775
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:12,237
Fire...

776
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:36,094
Kill all of them.

777
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:40,098
Dong Joo.

778
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,392
Dong Joo.

779
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:44,478
Stop it immediately!

780
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:59,201
What is that? Where are you going?

781
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:03,372
Tell him that I am sorry
that it is not much.

782
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,832
To whom?

783
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:12,965
Your brother.

784
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,092
What is his name?

785
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:25,853
Nok Du.

786
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,045
(The Tale of Nokdu)

787
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,839
Dan Ho. That jerk.

788
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:38,091
I cannot spare him any longer.

789
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:40,969
A group of robbers did this?

790
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:42,679
I will find and kill them...

791
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:44,264
no matter what.

792
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,273
Is this what you were trying...

793
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,733
to hide from me?

794
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:57,653
Hanyang? You must take things easy
for the time being.

795
01:02:57,736 --> 01:02:59,738
There is a conversation
I have not finished yet.

796
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:03,200
Until when will you ride it?

797
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:06,703
I guess fate found its way to you.
