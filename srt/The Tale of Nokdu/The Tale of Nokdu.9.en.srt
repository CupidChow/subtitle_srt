5
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,201
Did you say
that a piece of his sleeve was cut?

6
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,494
Yes.

7
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,716
Hey, you. Come out for...

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,886
Goodness. What is going on?

9
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,471
It is all right.

10
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,931
Gosh.

11
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,613
- Wait.
- Stop.

12
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,073
I know him.

13
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,242
He is not the man
you are looking for.

14
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,660
Pardon?

15
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,289
My apologies.

16
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,751
I will look for him somewhere else.

17
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,258
Let us go.

18
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,890
Were you a chief administrative
officer at the police bureau?

19
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,810
Yes. I am on a stakeout.
I am looking for someone.

20
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,648
By the way,

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,529
what more
are you planning to do here?

22
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,863
Pardon?

23
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,619
Nothing.

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,415
By the way,
do you know this guy's name?

25
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,377
I wonder if you know who he is.

26
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,675
Why must I know his name?

27
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,552
I saw him at the market
and fancied him,

28
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,011
so I followed and talked to him.

29
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,598
I can get to know him
little by little.

30
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,482
You are indeed bold.

31
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,778
(Episode 17)

32
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,280
From what I've heard,

33
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,948
it has been a long time
since you were in Hanyang.

34
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,117
I heard you left Hanyang
for your health a long time ago.

35
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,995
Yes. I came to Hanyang
to make a mark in this world...

36
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,664
despite my parents' attempt
to stop me.

37
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,166
Your family served as civil servants
for generations.

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,668
On top of that, you are fragile,

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,961
but you are getting ready
to take the military service exam.

40
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,671
I am sure they must be worried.

41
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,549
However, if you are confident,

42
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,259
you should keep trying.

43
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,803
Yes, I ought to.

44
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,771
Right.

45
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,941
I have been keeping you company
for too long.

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,152
I shall leave now.

47
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,071
- But...
- Go home safely, my lord.

48
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,873
You two look good.

49
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,084
Thank you.

50
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,970
I do not have all night.
You could have kept it short.

51
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,685
Anyway, I will leave
now that it is over.

52
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,978
Bye.

53
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,068
I told you back there
that I would never let you go.

54
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,906
There is something I must do here.

55
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,741
Is that why you left me?

56
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,493
What must you do?

57
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,037
I cannot tell you.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,789
- Why not?
- It is just like...

59
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,457
how you disguised yourself
as a woman...

60
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,544
and why you are here with an alias.

61
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,213
I have my reasons too. Understand?

62
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,093
Fine, do as you please.

63
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,679
But keep your promise.

64
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,141
- You stamped it.
- What is this?

65
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,230
Is this the promissory note?

66
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,399
I finally caught the person
who took my money,

67
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,942
so why should I let you go?

68
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,152
I will not let you leave
before you pay me...

69
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,238
the entire interest
and the principal, got it?

70
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,828
- Go.
- Hey.

71
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,207
He is your son?

72
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,462
Yes, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,508
Do you remember
that I had a young son?

74
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,846
After narrowly escaping death
20 years ago, I went back home.

75
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,475
My wife and my son fled with me.

76
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,771
The name I remember...

77
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,857
was not Nok Du.

78
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,692
We were in hiding,

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,528
so he could not use his real name.

80
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,072
Is that so?

81
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,075
I must see him.

82
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,119
Where is he?

83
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,706
I am sorry to tell you this,
but I have no idea either.

84
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,542
He thought I was locked in here...

85
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,045
and disappeared.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,404
I want an empty room.

87
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,160
I do not trust you.

88
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,454
Do not complain and follow me.

89
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,170
Are you watching me?

90
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,923
Why? Will you try to run away again
if you have the chance?

91
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,056
How is your wound?

92
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,808
Are you really curious?

93
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,397
How could you leave just like that?

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,483
I was unconscious.
We could have never met again.

95
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,573
That had nothing to do with me.

96
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,952
How could you say that?

97
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,942
Fine.

98
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,861
Do not worry about my well-being
and pay me back.

99
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:48,946
Understand?

100
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,989
Fine.

101
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,535
So do not mind me either.

102
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,080
Who said that I did? The feelings
I have for you are gone.

103
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,290
I have never had any to begin with.

104
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,932
- That is so hot!
- Be patient, will you?

105
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,271
- That looks good.
- It's too hot!

106
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,273
One chicken would do.

107
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,608
You should be more sparing.

108
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,277
Are you not proud of him?

109
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,403
He passed
the first stage examination...

110
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,487
in that state of his.

111
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,031
After the palace examination,
he may win the first place.

112
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,324
He needs to eat well.

113
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,994
You need to keep your stomach full
before taking an examination.

114
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,829
I should not be sparing about this.

115
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,832
You are right.
Being a scrooge is a waste.

116
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,251
Still, there are only four of us.

117
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,336
Having two chickens for a meal is...

118
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,380
That is enough!

119
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,924
Why do you nag so much?

120
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,343
Well... I just thought...

121
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,678
we should be more...

122
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,772
Hey, there.
You should have breakfast.

123
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,025
I will open the door.

124
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,363
Oh, my goodness!

125
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,532
What is it? What is going on?

126
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,667
Goodness, look at that mess.

127
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,185
You see, she has
such horrible sleeping habits.

128
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,812
We were far away
when we fell asleep.

129
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,273
I do not want you
to misunderstand the situation.

130
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,108
She owes me money.

131
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,861
He is right. He caught me
by coincidence.

132
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:56,365
Our relationship is equal to that
of a creditor and a debtor.

133
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,325
He is right. I have to pay
a 70-percent interest.

134
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,035
He is a terrible moneylender.

135
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,620
We have no feelings for each other.

136
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,247
He is correct.

137
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,793
Since she is back,

138
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,587
you will not be crying
during the nighttime.

139
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,882
Hey, Aeng Du.

140
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,177
I cried because my wound hurt.

141
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:21,223
Sure, sure. Let us say that is so.
Can we eat now?

142
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,808
Welcome back.

143
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,352
I am truly happy to see you again.

144
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,234
Have you all been well?

145
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,445
Did you eat a lot
of delicious dishes in Hanyang?

146
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:40,367
I am only eating to survive.

147
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,953
Hey, that is not true.

148
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,081
I keep thinking...

149
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,166
about the meat pancake
and Korean kebab.

150
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,586
I miss Yul Mu.

151
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,297
Have some of this.

152
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,257
Do not say such a thing.

153
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,176
What do you think will happen
if he comes here?

154
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,677
Think before you talk.

155
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,722
By the way, what brings you here?

156
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,140
What brings me here?

157
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,392
What? What?

158
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,813
I thought that this innocent man...

159
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,232
might suffer here in Hanyang.

160
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,194
But...

161
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,782
That is not my problem.

162
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,577
I thought it was morally right
for me to help him.

163
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,662
All right!

164
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,998
Let us say that is the case.

165
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,167
- Let us eat now.
- Okay.

166
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,293
Let us eat now.

167
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,467
Goodness.

168
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,721
My goodness.

169
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,682
You guys are being ridiculous
from so early in the morning.

170
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,059
She needs to eat a lot...

171
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,771
in order to work hard to repay me.

172
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,361
Anyway, I must go to work.

173
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,364
I need to go as well.

174
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:02,908
Do not go.

175
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,619
See yourself out.

176
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,958
I cannot believe
this obnoxious situation.

177
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,168
Is this mine too?

178
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,701
The royal forces
and Grand Prince Neungyang...

179
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,995
are all keeping their eyes
on the chancellor and my father.

180
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,997
Is this all happening because of me?

181
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,666
I wonder who else
is involved in this.

182
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,886
I heard you are having trouble
falling asleep.

183
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,638
This medicine is good for insomnia.

184
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,806
So you should have some.

185
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,058
Thank you.

186
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,019
But...

187
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,229
is it really okay for me
to stay here...

188
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,899
when I am not even doing anything?

189
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,402
What do you mean?

190
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,615
You are diligently getting ready
to help me in the near future.

191
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,159
When the time comes,

192
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,412
I will give you back
the life you once lost.

193
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,705
Okay.

194
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,750
I will do my best to help.

195
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,943
I do not know what you did wrong.

196
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,194
But every time we talk about you,

197
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,946
she throws a huge fit...

198
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,656
saying she totally
got fooled by you.

199
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,743
We are obligated
to follow her orders.

200
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,161
I hope you understand.

201
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,497
Yes, I understand.

202
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,375
I will not tell anyone
that I met you today.

203
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,169
I think it would be best for you
to give up...

204
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,254
No, I cannot do that.

205
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,049
Can you please help me?

206
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,134
I will do anything. Please.

207
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,512
Well...

208
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,267
Actually, I think I know a way.

209
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,970
What happened?

210
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,014
Why did Lady Chun die?

211
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,433
I should have protected her.

212
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,393
I do not know what to say.

213
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,189
Are you okay?

214
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,815
Did you not get injured?

215
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,610
What about the widows?

216
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,947
We already took them
to a safe place.

217
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,951
Who in the world killed Lady Chun?

218
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,703
Did you see his face?

219
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,790
He was wearing a mask,
and he was very nimble.

220
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,709
Lady Chun was surrounded
by the royal forces,

221
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,753
but he was bold enough
to shoot an arrow and run away.

222
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,005
Who in the world
would do that? And why?

223
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,257
I will find him
and kill him at all costs...

224
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,551
regardless of who he may be.

225
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,013
Do you still not get it?

226
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,239
What? Lord Heo?

227
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,242
Think about who ordered you
to move to another base.

228
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,785
And who do you think
would be angry at the fact...

229
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,579
that Lady Chun decided
to work for me instead?

230
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,999
We cannot jump to conclusions
merely based on that.

231
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,877
The chancellor is currently
locked up in his house.

232
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,588
His Majesty is suspicious of him,
but he has lost the evidence.

233
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,258
And that is why
His Majesty locked him up.

234
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,717
Then...

235
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,972
are you saying Lady Chun
was the evidence?

236
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,600
If she were still alive,

237
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,353
the chancellor would be dead by now.

238
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,695
Do you think Lady Min disappeared...

239
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,446
by a coincidence?

240
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,618
Her dead body was found
in the chancellor's house.

241
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,001
I will help you take your revenge.

242
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,087
What do you say?

243
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,548
You can become the new leader
of the Muweol Corps,

244
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,008
get your revenge,

245
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,052
and help me create a new world.

246
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,976
What is there to think about?

247
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,020
You should do it.

248
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,905
The Muweol Corps
will create a new base here.

249
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,489
And our soldiers are ready.

250
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,824
So we should
get ready for the revolt...

251
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:39,036
But the chancellor
has not made up his mind yet.

252
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,621
I think the people here...

253
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,874
are all we need
to carry out the revolt.

254
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,085
- Do you disagree?
- You are right.

255
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,546
I agree.

256
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,550
Then how about
we write a declaration...

257
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,220
before we carry out the revolt?

258
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,931
Let us promise that we are one...

259
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,391
and that we will all be responsible
for what happens.

260
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,481
It is not because
I do not trust you.

261
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,734
I just think we should keep a record
just to be sure.

262
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,577
Fine.

263
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,041
Let us write the declaration.

264
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,255
I am here to meet Lord Park.

265
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,492
He is the brother
of an acquaintance.

266
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,871
He receives money and introduces
servants to his sister.

267
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,165
But she is apparently
really fussy...

268
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,125
and always replaces her servants
with new ones.

269
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,962
I feel like the two of them...

270
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,173
are scamming people.

271
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,568
I would like to work
as a servant in the palace.

272
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,828
I know you are hoping to work
as a servant,

273
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,207
but getting a job in the palace
is not easy.

274
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,459
Is that not enough?

275
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,256
This is way too little.

276
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,343
But there is a way.

277
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,308
Sign this.

278
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,355
You get paid regularly
if you work in the palace,

279
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,691
so it will only take you
three months to pay me back.

280
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,202
Wait.

281
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,079
What is it? Why?

282
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:18,130
(You shall owe 1,000 yang.)

283
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:21,842
"Three months"?

284
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,011
It will take more than 30 years.

285
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,013
My goodness.

286
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,225
Some people tend to be
quick-witted like you.

287
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,269
But what is the use?

288
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,730
You may have come here willingly,

289
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,565
but that is not the case
when you leave.

290
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:38,817
- Let me go.
- Stay still.

291
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,736
You will have to sign this anyway.

292
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,905
Hey, wait.

293
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,990
My gosh, hey.

294
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:46,783
What...

295
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,834
Unbelievable. You guys
have no business ethics.

296
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,169
She belongs to me.

297
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,630
She is busy trying to pay me back.

298
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,342
Do you both want to die?

299
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,260
Kill them!

300
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,287
Are you all right?

301
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,456
Of course, I am.

302
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,041
Let us get one thing straight.

303
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,919
Had I been not injured, by now,
those jerks would have been...

304
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,003
You are bleeding.

305
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,171
What?

306
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,635
My nose is not bleeding
because I got punched.

307
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,636
It was dark, so I bumped into...

308
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,597
No. You are bleeding over there.

309
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,228
This...

310
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,526
It was healing, but it ruptured...

311
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,986
when I used these muscles.
I am fine though.

312
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,863
You are not fine at all.

313
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,823
I do not care if it ruptured
or was cut. You are bleeding.

314
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,868
Where is the clinic?

315
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,244
Come with me.

316
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,670
Were you the only one...

317
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,381
who managed to live that day?

318
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:29,386
I was the only one
who was still alive.

319
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,988
It is late. What brings you here?

320
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,782
You have not come to visit me.

321
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,452
I wanted to see you...

322
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,871
even if it was rude of me
to come here.

323
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,290
I am sorry.

324
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,085
Why have you come to visit me?

325
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,049
- The chancellor...
- I do not want to talk about him.

326
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,302
It is not something
you can meddle with.

327
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,720
"Meddle"?

328
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,765
I am concerned.

329
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,185
I am concerned
that your old friend...

330
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:22,022
may have been disloyal to you
and caused you distress.

331
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,238
Do you know that it only took
a moment for you to change?

332
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,202
When I came to the palace
as the crown princess,

333
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,871
you were very kind to me.

334
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,583
- After that day...
- That day?

335
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,920
I know that my sin for having lost
the child was not light, but...

336
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,004
My queen.

337
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,092
I have told you multiple times
not to mention that again.

338
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,263
I could not even mention
the incident for 20 years.

339
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:57,099
I did not know
that my sin was so grave that...

340
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,226
I do not deserve comfort
from my own husband.

341
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,645
Yes.
That is the kind of husband I am.

342
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:05,691
So it would be much better
if you stop worrying about me.

343
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,460
Oh, no.

344
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:29,923
He keeps bleeding. Is he okay?

345
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:33,051
Probably not.

346
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,804
If he keeps bleeding, he will die.

347
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,515
- What?
- Let me see.

348
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,019
Goodness.

349
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,563
Wait here for a moment.

350
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,237
Grab that
and wipe the blood for him.

351
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,531
Look how dirty your husband looks.

352
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,325
- He is not my husband.
- I am not her husband.

353
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,492
What?

354
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,913
How odd.

355
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,138
I can wipe it myself.

356
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,642
My goodness. You are right.

357
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,188
What?

358
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,857
You said that you did not care
if I was hurt or not.

359
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:53,442
Then, why are you worried about me?

360
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,360
I was not worried.

361
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,864
You got hurt because of me,
so I feel obligated.

362
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,158
But your face says otherwise.

363
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,745
You do not know what to do
because you are worried and sorry.

364
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,249
I am getting tired
of correcting you.

365
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,710
Think whatever you want.

366
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,184
By the way,
that place we were at earlier.

367
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,353
Why would the police
not arrest them?

368
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,687
Why do they do nothing about it?

369
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,607
The police always raid
the place with the officers...

370
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,400
while making a lot of noise.

371
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,152
So they would just flee...

372
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,238
through the back door when they
find out that the police are coming.

373
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,034
Why did you go there
if you knew it was dangerous?

374
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,166
Forget it. Do not answer that.

375
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,459
Hey.

376
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:55,712
Are you not hungry?

377
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,844
Ta-da. Do you want
to get some gukbap?

378
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,055
You had the time to take that?

379
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:06,932
Gosh.

380
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,647
Hey, did you steal
all the money there?

381
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,648
In that chaos?

382
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,400
Goodness.

383
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,777
- Give me that. Pay me back.
- Why?

384
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,654
- It is my money.
- You owe me. Pay back my money.

385
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,865
I took it.
What are you talking about?

386
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:25,200
Hey, I was the one who took this.

387
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,994
- Fine. Do not pay me back.
- What?

388
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:28,871
Come along.

389
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,248
- Let us go.
- I took this, not you.

390
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,041
How about we switch?

391
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,877
- That is ridiculous.
- I saved you.

392
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,087
- That is the least you can do.
- Forget it.

393
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,131
- Give me that.
- I said I would pay you back.

394
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,299
Are you...

395
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,177
already having a lovers' quarrel?

396
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,762
Hello.

397
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:00,068
What is going on?
You keep doing that.

398
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:02,362
You keep looking back.

399
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,072
I keep telling myself
that she is not,

400
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,450
but I think it is her.

401
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,534
What do you mean?

402
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:11,580
I think I might have seen the lady
we used to serve.

403
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,664
The lady...

404
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,754
Wait. Are you talking about Eun Seo?

405
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:19,963
Yes.

406
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,424
I am certain that it was her.

407
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,218
If she lived,

408
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,969
she would be around that age.

409
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,013
But we took care
of all of their bodies.

410
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,223
What nonsense is that?

411
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,934
My goodness.
Do you not remember that?

412
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,061
No matter how many times
we dug up the holes,

413
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,022
we did not find a body for the lady.

414
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,776
(Inn)

415
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,863
You two were on a nice date.

416
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,616
I wonder if it is appropriate
of me to tag along.

417
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:49,910
It was not nice.

418
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:56,792
You tried to get rid of me...

419
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,710
because you wanted
to be alone with him that day.

420
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:00,879
Things have changed.

421
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,173
Yes.

422
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:07,052
I realized that he was lame
after dating him.

423
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,180
I should say that to you.

424
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,270
Are you on a stakeout once again?

425
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,688
By the way,

426
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,691
have you found that man
you were looking for?

427
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,193
No, I have not.

428
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,655
Tonight, I am not on duty.

429
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,490
I could not sleep, so I wanted...

430
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:30,742
to ride the swing
like you did last time.

431
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:32,828
The swing?

432
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,373
No...

433
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:45,716
We met at the swing over there.

434
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:49,720
He looked extremely sad
and wanted to ride the swing.

435
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:53,724
I guess you have trouble sleeping.

436
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,309
You see,

437
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,352
people need to sleep well.

438
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:00,397
If not, they feel like death.

439
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:05,694
Thanks to my insomnia,
I could meet you.

440
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,697
I am happy that you made me laugh.

441
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,494
Do you want me...

442
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,539
to tell you a way?

443
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,002
- What?
- A way?

444
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:26,215
A way to protect that boy
from His Majesty.

445
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,800
Is there something I can do?

446
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,803
He should take the throne.

447
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,057
- What?
- You said he was bright and smart.

448
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,434
Your son did seem so.

449
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:38,560
No.

450
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,854
I meant His Majesty's son.

451
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,440
How about we dethrone
the current King...

452
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,653
and put that boy on the throne?

453
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,663
Hurry up.

454
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,957
Walk slower.

455
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,922
I thought he was going
to relieve my insomnia.

456
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,048
Darn it.

457
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:11,510
Yes, I will.

458
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,680
Come on, now. Goodness.

459
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,517
- Hurry up.
- Goodness.

460
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,977
Oh, dear.

461
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:21,854
All right.

462
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,105
All right.

463
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:25,399
Look here!

464
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,651
The King is like a lunatic
with his eyes and ears closed...

465
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,654
and is wielding a sword
at everyone around him.

466
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,698
And who gave him that sword?

467
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,950
Who is responsible
for closing his eyes and ears?

468
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:37,911
Since I handed him that sword,

469
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:40,247
I ought to make him put it down.

470
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,707
That is ridiculous.

471
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,711
Are you saying it is okay to switch
the king if he is not worthy enough?

472
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,921
If the next king does not
make you content,

473
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,631
will you do the same?

474
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,550
That is not what I meant.

475
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,594
Do not be arrogant...

476
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,679
and do your best
in your given position.

477
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,474
There are still some individuals
who listen to me.

478
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,393
Hand over that boy to me...

479
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,728
That is enough!

480
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:06,273
You want him
to take his father's place?

481
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,611
I have no desire to make Nok Du
do such a heinous deed.

482
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:14,156
And you have no right
to dethrone the King.

483
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,074
Wake up.

484
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:40,891
How do you feel?

485
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,852
I do feel refreshed.

486
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,688
You will sleep well tonight...

487
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,649
since you exercised.

488
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,817
Try staying busy...

489
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:53,654
all throughout the day.

490
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,115
If you do, you will become
very drowsy by sundown.

491
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,744
Do not make your men
do all the work.

492
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:04,206
Catch the thieves
and question them yourself.

493
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,290
Okay?

494
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,882
I am guessing many people
cannot sleep peacefully at night...

495
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:16,718
because of the King's incompetence.

496
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:24,351
Well... I mean...

497
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:29,898
Do people not talk about the King
behind his back?

498
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,734
- Right.
- Right.

499
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,032
Have you...

500
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:42,369
ever seen His Majesty?

501
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,039
No, I have not.

502
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:49,835
I am just
an old chief administrative officer.

503
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,422
By the way,

504
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:57,092
it seems like you have
a great interest in the King.

505
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:58,677
- No.
- No.

506
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,804
What?

507
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,764
I mean...

508
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,810
I have absolutely no interest.
I thought you asked me.

509
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:12,941
I see.

510
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,285
This may be out of line,
but may I ask one question?

511
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,872
Do you usually sleep alone?

512
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,752
Yes. Why do you ask?

513
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:36,715
I had trouble sleeping by myself.

514
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:38,842
But...

515
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,720
it helped.

516
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,848
What do you mean?

517
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,269
To have someone by your side.

518
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:59,738
How is it? Not a single ghost
will come in here tonight.

519
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,586
It helps to have someone
who cares and worries about you.

520
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:29,726
I do not know your story,

521
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,272
but if you cannot sleep
because of a similar reason,

522
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:37,234
you should ask your family members
for help.

523
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,778
Ask them to accompany you.

524
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,289
You badmouthed me, did you not?

525
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:53,208
No, that is not true.

526
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,252
Gosh, you are quick-witted.

527
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:56,837
I hate it.

528
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,841
I knew it. What did you say?

529
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,676
You know what I said.

530
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:03,844
What?

531
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:07,055
Hey! I told you not to tell anyone
about that!

532
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,473
You have no idea.

533
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,309
Then what is it?

534
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,905
Why are you not going in?

535
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:25,782
I need to stop by somewhere.
You can go in first.

536
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:26,742
Where...

537
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:32,080
Right. I said I would not ask.

538
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,335
You can have secrets...

539
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,880
or push me away. I do not mind.

540
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,008
But do not do anything dangerous.

541
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,347
Just promise me that.

542
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,266
If you do, I will not be nosy.

543
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:01,777
Do not worry.

544
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:24,174
This will not cause a problem
for Lord Jung Yun Jeo.

545
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,468
Better yet,

546
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,054
this will protect him.

547
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,683
Will you keep your promise...

548
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,769
about finding him
and keeping him safe?

549
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:36,979
Of course.

550
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:41,066
And this is the proof of my promise.

551
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:48,907
(Jung Yi Hyung)

552
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,815
He took the bait.

553
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,151
Soon, I will be able to meet...

554
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,154
the King's son.

555
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:19,081
You guys have grown so big
while I was gone.

556
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:24,837
After I met him,

557
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,880
I realized how much I missed him.

558
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,635
But I should not
feel that way, right?

559
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,683
There you go.

560
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:43,814
Life never goes
the way you want it to.

561
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:49,778
I think these chicks grew on me.

562
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,697
I will pretend I believe you.

563
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,408
Let us go.

564
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:56,243
Nok Du got you a room...

565
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,370
I mean, he stole one for you.

566
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:02,457
Come on.

567
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:13,719
I am sorry to ask you this
at this hour.

568
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,637
But the room at the very end
is very spacious.

569
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,140
Then you should let Dong Joo
sleep in that spacious room.

570
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:19,224
But I noticed...

571
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,392
that there is a draught
coming through the door...

572
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,188
Are you saying it is okay
for me to freeze to death?

573
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,772
I can sleep in any room.

574
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:29,193
Please, my lord.

575
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,655
I have to say,
this is very upsetting.

576
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,576
- Come on out.
- My lord.

577
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,369
Why is the threshold so high?

578
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:40,746
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

579
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:42,831
Come inside.

580
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,584
Why are you causing a fuss?

581
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,377
I can sleep anywhere.

582
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,963
He just wants to keep you nearby.

583
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:53,091
Your rooms are connected
by a window.

584
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,595
You little brat.
Why would you say that?

585
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:58,722
You did not have to point that out.

586
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,683
They are trying so hard to act like
they do not like each other.

587
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:03,310
You are so slow-witted.

588
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,604
Do not mind us.

589
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:07,940
By the way,
you have an exam tomorrow.

590
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,984
So make sure
you get some good sleep.

591
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,445
- What test?
- It is nothing.

592
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:14,905
Let us go.

593
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,698
Just hurry up and go to sleep.

594
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,618
What?

595
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,208
"To have someone by your side..."

596
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,836
"who cares and worries about you."

597
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:56,798
Your Majesty.

598
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,927
Should I tell Her Majesty
that you are here?

599
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:06,558
No.

600
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:08,727
Let us go.

601
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:21,907
Over here!

602
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,492
How was the exam?

603
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,327
You must be tired.

604
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,998
Master, you cannot bring
Aeng Du outside like this.

605
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,751
He was dying to know
how well you did.

606
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:34,878
It is okay.
We are only out for a while.

607
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:36,880
Anyway, I feel like...

608
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,384
you will become a general.

609
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,974
This is all because
you have a great master.

610
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,601
Let us go home now
and eat grilled pork.

611
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:53,856
Okay, sure.
This fool caught an entire pig.

612
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:56,692
I own a lot of things,

613
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,486
but money is what I have the most.

614
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,864
- I have told you numerous times.
- Well...

615
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,157
You can eat without me.
I need to go somewhere.

616
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,659
- No, wait.
- Aeng Du.

617
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,244
- You can eat my share.
- Okay.

618
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:10,289
I will make sure I do that.
Do not worry.

619
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:11,999
But...

620
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:22,843
My lord.

621
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,638
I need to buy a book.

622
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:28,640
If you tell me what it is,
I will get it for you.

623
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,309
I would like to see it myself.

624
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,810
It will not take long.

625
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,273
Okay, then. Go ahead.

626
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:38,901
I will wait for you at my place.
Make sure you stay safe.

627
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:40,527
Okay.

628
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,571
I will be off now.

629
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:56,752
Here!

630
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,879
Hey, come on!

631
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,758
I am here to see Lord Park.

632
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:23,028
There we go.

633
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:24,738
Come on. Stop it.

634
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:31,286
Hey!

635
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,163
Calm down.

636
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,135
Okay, great.

637
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,137
- Let us begin.
- That is no good.

638
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:50,556
- Come on.
- That's 32.

639
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:51,682
Hey, stop it.

640
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,851
- What is that?
- Cut it out.

641
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:06,321
He could have just
sneaked into my place.

642
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:08,866
Why did he call him here?

643
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:13,704
Arrest them!

644
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,163
- Arrest them!
- Arrest them!

645
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:16,248
Where do you think you are going?

646
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,335
- Stay still!
- My goodness.

647
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:21,962
Hey!

648
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,881
- Do not move!
- Stay still!

649
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:25,632
- Arrest them!
- Arrest them!

650
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:27,843
- Stop right there!
- Do not move!

651
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,265
Stay still!

652
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,268
Do not move!

653
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,200
I thought it would be you.

654
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,452
I guess I was right.

655
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:54,745
I missed you.

656
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,330
Have you been well?

657
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,461
What do you think you are doing?

658
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:03,712
How dare you do this to me?

659
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:04,755
Why?

660
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:06,882
I just did what you did to me.

661
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:09,176
Backstabbing...

662
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,844
is pretty fun.

663
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,222
The stakes are huge.

664
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:15,265
It is an illegal gambling house.

665
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,975
On top of that,
there are some wicked guys...

666
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:19,436
who blackmail people
and force them to loan money.

667
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,356
My gosh, we already know that.

668
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:24,358
But it is not easy
to crack down on gamblers.

669
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,069
That is because you always go
looking like that.

670
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,446
Your superior is very good
at hiding himself.

671
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,115
He gets changed
and goes on stakeouts.

672
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,116
Our superior?

673
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,661
I am very close to your superior.

674
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:38,830
Anyway, it will benefit you
if you catch those guys.

675
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:41,792
I will come up with a plan.

676
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:43,919
Arrest them!

677
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:45,546
- Arrest them!
- Arrest them!

678
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,645
If you want to kill me,
cut the nonsense and just...

679
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:05,399
I can let you live...

680
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:07,901
if you answer my questions.

681
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,738
Why did you get my brother involved?

682
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:14,408
I did not get him involved.

683
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,493
We just met by coincidence.

684
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,912
He needed a place to stay...

685
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:22,708
Let me ask you again.

686
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,586
What do you know about me?

687
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,838
What did my brother tell you?

688
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:32,342
I do not need to know anything
about you.

689
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,512
So I did not hear anything
or ask anything.

690
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,724
What are you so curious about?

691
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,353
That is not the answer
I wanted to hear.

692
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,816
I do not know what you mean.

693
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,693
But I know one thing for sure.

694
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,154
You will kill me...

695
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,865
regardless of what I tell you.

696
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,901
You...

697
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,244
You are too quick-witted
for your own good.

698
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,247
Do you think you will not pay...

699
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:46,124
for what you have done to me?

700
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,710
Then, did you do that,
thinking you would not pay for it?

701
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,046
To innocent women?

702
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:55,843
If you have committed a crime,
you must pay for it...

703
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:57,386
regardless of who you are.

704
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,283
Hey, Hwang Tae.

705
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:24,788
Is Nok Du behind this?

706
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,416
- What?
- He said he needed to talk to me.

707
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,502
Had I known what his plan was,
I would not have come. Bye.

708
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:31,837
Hold on.

709
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:35,591
We just got you away from that jerk.
What are you talking about?

710
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,426
He did not keep me there
against my will.

711
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:39,678
So tell Nok Du to stop
pulling a stunt like this...

712
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:41,847
and secretly visiting me.

713
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,223
Wait. Hwang Tae.

714
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:44,349
Please.

715
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,979
Let me just be. Please.

716
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:57,339
- Next time.
- What?

717
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:58,757
Let us finish this next time.

718
00:54:58,841 --> 00:54:59,883
You crazy...

719
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,471
If I wield my sword at you again,

720
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,140
you will be dead anyway.

721
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:25,742
Hwang Tae went back?

722
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:26,994
Yes.

723
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:30,914
I thought about slapping him
in the back and taking him here.

724
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,333
But he was really hostile.

725
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,877
He said he was not staying there
against his will.

726
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,628
He told me to tell you
to leave him alone.

727
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:37,963
Goodness.

728
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:40,757
By the way, what should we do?

729
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,385
He is not just anyone.
He is from the royal family.

730
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,014
The police will come to arrest you.

731
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:48,640
We should not stay here.
Let us run away.

732
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:51,727
No. I must enter the palace.

733
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:55,564
I doubt that he will report to me.

734
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,441
I know that he is plotting treason.

735
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:01,236
Does he know anything about that?

736
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:03,238
I am not sure
if he really does not know...

737
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:05,949
or if he is hiding it
even when he knows.

738
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:09,995
This is complicated. Darn it.

739
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,706
Goodness.

740
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:20,672
I am sorry.

741
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:22,633
This is all because of me.

742
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,552
I really had no idea.

743
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:27,137
Had I known that it was Nok Du
who wanted to see me...

744
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:28,805
It is all right.

745
00:56:31,308 --> 00:56:33,018
You have come back.

746
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:36,897
I found out a fun fact...

747
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:41,109
that he is His Majesty's son.

748
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:42,653
Pardon?

749
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,364
Do you know Nok Du?

750
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:47,074
I know him very well.

751
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,744
I have desperately
been looking for him.

752
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,830
So I can kill him.

753
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,544
When it is time to kill him,

754
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:03,382
you must help me.

755
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,219
Do you understand?

756
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:11,932
Of course.

757
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:15,435
I have already promised that to you.

758
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:42,212
(First Place: Yeon Soo)

759
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:47,968
You will go into the palace?

760
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:54,349
You will enter the palace?

761
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,852
Yes. I won the first place.

762
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:00,606
You will be
in front of the King then?

763
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:01,732
Yes.

764
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:11,742
You will be able to see the King?

765
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:16,622
Do you want to come?

766
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:18,749
I was told
that my family could come.

767
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,710
Well, you are not my family.

768
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,837
But you can pretend to be my family
and come see me.

769
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,759
Forget it. Why would I go there?

770
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,263
Do not come if you do not want to.

771
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:35,432
Whatever.

772
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,755
His Majesty has asked to see me.

773
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:08,340
Yes.

774
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:11,093
His Majesty has left
to award the certificates.

775
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:12,886
Please wait for a moment.

776
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:25,375
First place of civil service exam,
Kim Young Joon.

777
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,712
First place
of military service exam, Yeon Soo.

778
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:30,255
Come forward.

779
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:14,633
Well, you are not my family.

780
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,844
But you can pretend to be my family
and come see me.

781
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,872
First place
of military service exam.

782
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:46,707
Yeon Soo.

783
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:47,833
Yes.

784
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:49,418
Congratulations.

785
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:17,613
Will you not accept the certificate?

786
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:26,163
This is all because of you.

787
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:27,915
This is all because...

788
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:30,042
you are the son...

789
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:32,211
of His Majesty.

790
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,827
(The Tale of Nokdu)

791
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:09,706
Show your respect to Her Majesty.

792
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,208
But you seem...

793
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,585
you have lost your way.

794
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:15,712
What did you say?

795
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:18,507
Your son is alive.

796
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:20,717
Are you not curious...

797
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:23,679
what I told His Majesty in there?

798
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:27,683
Did you live your life
under the name, Nok Du?

799
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:29,518
When His Majesty
goes out in disguise,

800
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,311
approach him and win him over.

801
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,522
He comes out in disguise?
