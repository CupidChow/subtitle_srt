(Episode 9)

4
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,787
Who are you?

5
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,565
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,149
Are you trying to sabotage my plan?

7
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,277
What do you mean?

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,280
I came here
because I heard that you got caught.

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,241
That was all part of my plan.

10
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,660
I need to get inside the house first
to do the deed.

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,413
Besides, you were planning to use
your sword without a disguise?

12
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,664
Excuse me.

13
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,041
Who on earth are you?

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,960
- How dare you?
- What?

15
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,670
Who said you could
interrupt our conversation?

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,173
- I was...
- Who are you?

17
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,466
Address me properly, you jerk.

18
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,844
She is my friend.

19
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,345
Stay away!

20
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,311
Go.

21
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,521
Go.

22
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,648
- Me?
- Yes.

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,247
Stop it!

24
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,583
How dare you?

25
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,590
You wench!

26
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,647
Who are you?

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,732
I apologize.

28
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,152
About the daughter-in-law
who lives there...

29
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,072
Do you mean Lady Kim?

30
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,615
Yes.

31
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,326
I am her friend.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,204
She is in danger now.

33
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,128
I am here, so do not worry.

34
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,257
Thank you for helping us.

35
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,883
However, this government office...

36
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,009
has been colluding
with her father-in-law...

37
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,094
for a very long time.

38
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,346
It will be of no use.

39
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,602
You should have come inside.

40
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,564
Why are you so brazen
and causing a scene?

41
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,942
How dare you humiliate me?

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,614
Who are you?

43
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,242
Are you not the lady
from the village for widows?

44
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,827
The beautiful behind?

45
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,747
Why do you keep appearing
in front of me?

46
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,124
I do not understand it either.

47
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,084
How dare you inconvenience me
once again?

48
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,674
Open the palanquin!

49
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,967
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,136
How dare you?

51
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,262
- Stop it!
- Should I beat you more?

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,388
Do not move!

53
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,599
Did I not beat you enough?

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,024
Hold on. Who are you?

55
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,491
Neither of you is
my daughter-in-law.

56
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,494
Where in the world is she?

57
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,166
Bring both of them inside!

58
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,250
Yes.

59
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,003
You two better explain...

60
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,464
when and how you switched places
with her!

61
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,023
Stop!

62
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,912
What is this about?

63
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,751
My lord, please go back.
This is a family issue.

64
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,464
How could it be a family issue
when there are so many armed men?

65
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,799
Take them all in!

66
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,217
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

67
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,593
- Hurry!
- Follow me!

68
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,178
- Come here!
- Follow me!

69
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,306
- Come here!
- We are innocent!

70
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,100
- Come here!
- Wait a minute.

71
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,184
Do not touch me!

72
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,896
- Hurry up!
- Goodness.

73
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,981
Hey!

74
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,358
- Hey!
- Come here!

75
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,017
My gosh.

76
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,310
Goodness.

77
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,986
I owe you an apology
for many things.

78
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
Do not say that.

79
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,199
She is your mother.
I ought to help her.

80
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,744
They seem to be close.

81
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,750
Yes, I heard that they are.

82
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,670
Did he really believe what you said?

83
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,715
Yes. Since I had never left
my quarters after getting married,

84
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,634
there was no way
he would recognize my face.

85
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,083
Why did you not leave
with your lady?

86
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,211
You two could have run away.

87
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,049
What were you doing there?

88
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,845
What?

89
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,722
What did you and Cha Yul Mu do
in that house?

90
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,098
Why do you ask?

91
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,351
You finally met the woman
you were yearning for...

92
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,312
and almost died while rescuing her.

93
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,773
In the midst of all that, were you
curious about what we were doing?

94
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,067
Why are you asking?

95
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,321
I was curious.

96
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,907
What?

97
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,039
Was it wrong of me to be curious?

98
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,669
Gosh.

99
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,254
You are a jerk.

100
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,528
You little wench. Let me go.

101
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,154
After coming all the way here,

102
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,282
it would be wrong
to leave without him.

103
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,284
My gosh. Look around.

104
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,661
Hanyang is so huge.

105
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,330
How can we find Nok Du?

106
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,376
If there is a will,
there is always a way.

107
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,046
You little witch!

108
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,633
(Aseowon,
Muweol Corps' base in Hanyang)

109
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,033
So...

110
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,662
I tailed the assassin
after leaving the island.

111
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,499
I saw the assassin
entering a village full of widows.

112
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,501
"A village full of widows"?

113
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,295
Oh, dear.

114
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,505
By the way,

115
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,341
- who are...
- Right. A village full of widows.

116
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,801
Thank you.

117
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,511
When I entered the village,

118
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,431
they said men were banned
and beat me.

119
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,225
I even got into a fight
with a widow...

120
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,518
and got this scar.

121
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,104
Goodness.

122
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,900
So I came back to Hanyang.

123
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,402
I am going to wait
for another chance to get in there.

124
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,866
Do you happen to know...

125
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,036
about an assassination corps
led by women?

126
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,287
"Women"?

127
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,124
But you see...

128
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,626
Let me stop by the toilet.

129
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,212
Women do not like me.

130
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,464
Hey, you! Are you listening?

131
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,272
It is better for me to find him
rather than his father.

132
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,192
I hope everything
is all right with him.

133
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,318
Aeng Du...

134
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,737
What? Where did she go?

135
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,947
Aeng Du.

136
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,282
Hwang Aeng Du!

137
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,409
I am here.

138
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,412
My goodness.

139
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,542
What were you stuffing your mouth?
Where did you get it?

140
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,003
You love food too much.
How will you find Nok Du?

141
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,549
I think we will find him soon.

142
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,133
What do you mean?

143
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,475
I am sure it is him.

144
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,602
He still has the wound
around his eye,

145
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,187
so you just need to look for that.

146
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,190
We are shorthanded as of now.

147
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,252
Mudam Village?

148
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,837
I told you so.

149
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,921
Right.

150
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,189
Hwang Jang Gun
still has not returned.

151
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,609
Maybe he got lucky
and met Nok Du in Hanyang.

152
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,944
I hope that is the case.

153
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,345
Father, we must escape.

154
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,770
Hold my hand.

155
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,485
Father, you should go this way.

156
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,945
I will go that way.

157
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,071
What are you talking about?

158
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,155
This path also leads...

159
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,074
to the cave
that Master Hwang told us about.

160
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,243
- Let us meet there.
- We can go together.

161
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,953
- Come on.
- Hurry up and go, Father.

162
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,789
It is better for me to take
that path because it is less steep.

163
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,832
If we go together,
it will only put us in danger.

164
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,459
Then I will lure them.

165
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,044
Let us meet at the cave.

166
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,589
- You must be careful.
- Okay.

167
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,698
I... I...

168
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,471
His Majesty has arrived.

169
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,028
Your Majesty.

170
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,070
Get out of my way!

171
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:23,947
Your Majesty.

172
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,658
I am sure this was done
by the Queen Dowager.

173
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:27,784
How dare you?

174
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,038
Can you be responsible
for what you just said?

175
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,541
I am sorry to tell you this,

176
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,920
but rumors say the Queen Dowager
has been inviting shamans...

177
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,671
into her palace.

178
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,257
An animal that symbolizes...

179
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,800
the year of your birth
has been slaughtered...

180
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,094
beneath the tree
of Prince Yeongchang.

181
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,180
What do you think that means?

182
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,265
I want you to investigate
and find out...

183
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,268
who did something like this
and for what reason.

184
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,666
He appeared in Hanyang?

185
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,961
Yes, I received
a secret message earlier.

186
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,130
If I knew he would be there,
I would have stayed for longer.

187
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,758
Do you think Deul Le
went to Hanyang to find him?

188
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,302
If that was the case,
she would have gone to Aseowon.

189
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,720
But I never heard
that she went there.

190
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,098
Ladies!

191
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,145
The vice-curator asked us
to come to the gisaeng house.

192
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,943
Lady Kim, I have something to say.

193
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,027
Lady Kim.

194
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,738
Lady Kim. Lady Kim.

195
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,702
I want everyone to focus.

196
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,828
Prepare everything
with your utmost sincerity.

197
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,872
Bring out your motherly love.
Everyone, focus!

198
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,582
Place the meat pancakes over there.

199
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,375
Lady Kim likes them.

200
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,254
No, put that over there.

201
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,756
I thought we were invited
to a party.

202
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,050
But it seems like we are here
to work for you.

203
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,679
I know, right?

204
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,264
She went to see her family.

205
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,682
Who knows if she might
not be able to return...

206
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:15,893
Oh, right.

207
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,187
She might choose not to come back.

208
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,022
What are you talking about?

209
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,773
She told me
she will be back today.

210
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,444
Lady Kim always keeps her word.

211
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,655
Okay, fine.

212
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,283
Butcher a calf
and cook some beef ribs.

213
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:45,672
What?

214
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,264
Wait...

215
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,113
I will just walk.

216
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,865
We are on our way back
to the gisaeng house.

217
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,367
So do not feel pressured
and just hop on.

218
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,162
How can you ask a grown lady...

219
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,331
to hop on a horse with a grown man?

220
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,416
Here.

221
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,293
I let you ride that horse...

222
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,419
because you told me
that you know how to ride one.

223
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,587
But I do not think it will be safe
for you to ride with her.

224
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,172
I am lighter than you.

225
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,383
So it will be better for her
to ride with me.

226
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,969
Hop on, my daughter.

227
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,972
Hold my hand, Dong Joo.

228
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,353
Come on, my daughter.

229
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,613
My gosh, hey...

230
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,282
Mother, are you okay?

231
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:36,992
Did you get hurt?

232
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,952
I got distracted and fell.

233
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,878
I think I hurt my ankle.

234
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:28,752
Okay, do not eat too much.

235
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,754
- Okay.
- Let us wait a little bit.

236
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:32,965
When...

237
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,591
When will she...

238
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,905
My gosh.

239
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,673
Lady Kim.

240
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,658
My gosh, no!

241
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,148
Here you go.

242
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,109
My goodness, that little punk.

243
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,910
Hey, I told you
not to let her drink.

244
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,119
Why? I am going to drink.

245
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,205
My gosh, do not drink.

246
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,873
My goodness.

247
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,923
I bet it was nice to see them
after such a long time.

248
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,758
Did your family...

249
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,886
give you something nice
before you left?

250
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,930
Yes. Well...

251
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,766
my mother gave me
some seed capital...

252
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,893
to help me start over
in this village.

253
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,107
Nice.

254
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,784
It looks like
you are a lightweight drinker.

255
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,537
I have never consumed
alcohol before.

256
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,041
That was impressive. How did you
think of getting caught on purpose?

257
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,962
I was worried that your plan might
fail because of me. I am relieved.

258
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,046
By the way,

259
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,465
how did you steal it?

260
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,052
It is a secret.

261
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,222
Good work.

262
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,432
I will inform the boss,

263
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,100
and you will be
officially initiated.

264
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,185
That means...

265
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,604
I will be
in your organization, right?

266
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,063
You are almost there.

267
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,274
There is no reason
for us not to accept you...

268
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,901
unless you are not a widow.

269
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,280
Right.

270
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,634
Let us ask her
since she has come back now.

271
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,304
Pardon? What do you mean?

272
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,266
Why are you hitting
on Lord Yul Mu, Lady Kim?

273
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,601
Pardon?

274
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,771
Because she likes him. Darn it.

275
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,147
Gosh.

276
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,066
I know everything.

277
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,194
I, Yeon Geun the Vice-Curator,

278
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:25,572
have given my heart
to Lady Kim Nok Soon.

279
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,574
But why?

280
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,327
Why does Lady Kim
like a stray cat like him?

281
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,038
- "Meow, meow". Just eat this.
- Wait. What is this...

282
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,707
What? Why would I like him?

283
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,126
- Why? Why would I?
- Darn it.

284
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,964
That is not true.

285
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,551
Goodness.

286
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:49,513
Are you all right?

287
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,806
Darn it.

288
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,268
Are you all right?
You should stop drinking now.

289
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,894
My gosh.

290
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,646
Mother and daughter.

291
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,606
They are causing a mess.

292
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:01,358
Oh, no.

293
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,610
I told you
not to let Dong Joo drink.

294
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,904
She is unstoppable
when she gets drunk.

295
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,576
What happens to her
when she gets drunk?

296
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:14,538
She speaks what is on her mind.

297
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,082
She starts blabbing
about people's secrets.

298
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,126
Right.

299
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,086
Hey, you.

300
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,505
I told everyone
that your feet stink.

301
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,091
- My gosh, Dong Joo. Come on.
- Right?

302
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,302
Darn it.

303
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:42,608
My daughter,
we should head home now.

304
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,734
Forget that.

305
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,528
You should finish
what you were talking about earlier.

306
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,156
What do you think about Lord Yul Mu?

307
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:52,659
Every woman is bound
to like a man like him.

308
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,536
But I believe you should be
the last person to like him.

309
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,705
- Please. I do not...
- Fine.

310
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,373
It is true...

311
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,503
my mother likes someone.

312
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,552
My daughter.

313
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,189
My daughter is very drunk,
so she is making stuff up.

314
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,650
We should go home now.

315
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,027
Even if she is drunk,
she never makes stuff up.

316
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:28,862
Let us listen to her.

317
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,989
- Yes.
- Whom does she like?

318
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,867
Is it Lord Yul Mu or not?

319
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,249
The person...

320
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,626
my mother likes is...

321
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:43,919
It is my husband.

322
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,254
My late husband.

323
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,464
Honey!

324
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,100
"Honey"?

325
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,560
Is that the lady?

326
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,152
- Is he over there?
- Yes.

327
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,655
You are almost there.

328
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,240
There is no reason
for us not to accept you...

329
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,950
unless you are not a widow.

330
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,288
Every woman is bound
to like a man like him.

331
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,082
I do not think it is him.

332
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,296
I will finish...

333
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,673
what I was going to say.

334
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,304
I know that I should not,

335
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,806
but let me tell you why and how...

336
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,975
I ended up liking...

337
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,728
Lord Yul Mu.

338
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,313
Oh, no.

339
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,278
You are a true man.

340
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:52,696
And I am...

341
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,408
And I am also a woman after all.

342
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:00,913
Lady Kim.

343
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,001
My apologies, my lord.

344
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:08,962
No, no!

345
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:11,798
What...

346
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,392
How could she...

347
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,646
Darn it.

348
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,581
Darn it. I like you!

349
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,583
I like you!

350
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,773
Darn it. I like you!

351
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,942
I like you!

352
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,117
Goodness.

353
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:23,370
That was the weirdest dream of all.

354
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,290
Of course, that was a dream.

355
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,833
What would that be if not a dream?

356
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,344
Oh, no.

357
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,264
No, no. There is no way
I actually said that.

358
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,515
No.

359
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,078
She is the daughter
of the depraved mother.

360
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,747
I heard that too.

361
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,081
The daughter and the mother...

362
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:09,666
fought over a man
at the gisaeng house.

363
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,751
I heard that...

364
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,003
it was even messier than the war.

365
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,922
My gosh, go. Go that way.

366
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,889
All right. Repeat after me again.

367
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,516
Sister.

368
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,059
"Sister".

369
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,186
Good job.

370
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,772
You must address me
as your sister here.

371
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:32,814
Can you do that?

372
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,983
Of course. Do not worry.

373
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,445
Nok Du, do you have more of this?

374
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:42,407
No, you cannot call me like that!

375
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:43,784
Again.

376
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,203
How should you address me?
I just told you this.

377
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:48,789
Honey?

378
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:50,749
Darn it.

379
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,836
Sister, sister, sister!

380
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,878
Why?

381
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:58,131
Why must I address you as a sister?

382
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,259
I told you...

383
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,386
that I had to do something
outside the island.

384
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,389
My gosh, was becoming a woman
what you had to do?

385
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:06,890
No.

386
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,351
Aeng Du.

387
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,396
If people here find out
that I am a man,

388
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,565
I will be tortured and killed.

389
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,941
That cannot happen!

390
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,693
You cannot die!

391
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,986
Exactly.

392
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,737
So you should not
blow my cover, right?

393
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,406
- Right.
- Okay.

394
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,033
Repeat after me. "Sister".

395
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,079
Sister.

396
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,540
What a ridiculous story.

397
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,458
Goodness me.

398
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,254
My gosh.

399
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,173
That is enough.

400
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,466
I told you
that I had no other choice.

401
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:44,094
So the boss lives here?

402
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,054
In this village full of widows?

403
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:50,267
Yes. That is why
I cannot go back home now.

404
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,895
You are going so far
as to dressing up as a woman.

405
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:56,523
You should stay here
until you kill the boss. Sure thing.

406
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,860
How are my father and brother doing?

407
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,738
How many times do you need
to hear me say it?

408
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:03,989
They are doing fine.

409
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,657
Hwang Tae is recovering.

410
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:06,909
I also wrote them a letter,

411
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,786
saying that I will be coming back
with you from Hanyang...

412
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,747
and told them not to worry.

413
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,916
By the way...

414
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:17,794
So that daughter of yours...

415
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,339
knows that you are a man, right?

416
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,674
Yesterday, I heard her say,
"Darn it. I like you!"

417
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:24,843
"I like you!"

418
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,222
Was that meant for you
or the other man?

419
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,975
What do you think?

420
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:35,437
If it was you,

421
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:39,149
I would say
that she has horrible taste in men.

422
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,651
Come on.

423
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,737
She was babbling drunk.

424
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,322
Sure, sure.

425
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,829
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

426
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,541
Lord Yul Mu!

427
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:01,088
Lord Yul Mu! Give me a second!

428
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:03,632
How?

429
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,017
Lord Yul Mu!

430
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,437
Wait... Wait!

431
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,151
Lord Yul Mu!

432
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,530
Why?

433
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,741
Why can it not be me?

434
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:38,125
She must have gone insane.

435
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,340
Gosh! Lord Yul Mu.

436
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:46,967
Come here.

437
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:48,677
Lord Yul Mu.

438
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,848
Lord Yul Mu, please wait.

439
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,315
Lord Yul Mu.

440
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:44,775
Was it...

441
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,278
after the day I made
that persimmon ice flakes?

442
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:49,655
What?

443
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,198
Or was it at Okchundang?

444
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,741
Or...

445
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,993
was it on the horse?

446
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,206
Never mind. It does not matter.

447
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:03,794
You know very well who I love.

448
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,630
- "Love"?
- Yes.

449
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:09,007
To me, you are...

450
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,884
the friend of the woman I love...

451
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:14,054
No, you are her mother.

452
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,891
So please treat me as much.

453
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,270
What do you love so much
about Dong Joo?

454
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:24,314
What? Well...

455
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,650
I love everything about her
because I am in love with her.

456
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,528
It is not that I love her
because of certain things.

457
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,907
Then how do you know...

458
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:37,411
that you are in love?

459
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:42,749
How do you not know that?

460
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,752
You miss them when they are gone,
and you are happy to see them.

461
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,630
Even the most trivial things
make you worried.

462
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:53,677
Love is like a cough.
You cannot hold it back.

463
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,972
- "A cough"?
- Yes.

464
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,683
Yesterday,

465
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,394
you kissed me in front of everyone.

466
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,023
Was that not because...

467
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:09,026
you could not hide
your feelings for me?

468
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,946
Well... I guess so.

469
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,575
I cannot believe
that you have never been in love.

470
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,994
What? Do not be ridiculous.

471
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,622
I have been in love many times.

472
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,207
All right.

473
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,501
Anyway...

474
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,336
About your feelings for me...

475
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:28,921
I will give up on you.

476
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,591
- What?
- I truly apologize...

477
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,843
for the inconvenience I have caused.

478
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,720
Do not be concerned
about me anymore.

479
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,566
My gosh.

480
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,625
What? Come on.

481
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,948
I was wondering where you were.

482
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,533
And you were here.

483
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,913
Are you smiling? Seriously?

484
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,168
Well... I just...

485
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,507
Have you eaten?

486
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,594
Do you not know what kind
of humiliation I am receiving?

487
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:00,762
How could you smile and ask me
if I have eaten?

488
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:02,514
It was just because...

489
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,433
you seemed like
you had not eaten all day.

490
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:07,811
Why did you kiss him?
Were you crazy?

491
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,521
Was that the only solution you had?

492
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:12,316
You could have flipped the tables
or covered that girl's mouth.

493
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,568
Better yet, you could have hit me.

494
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:17,738
Right.

495
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,656
What is the deal with that girl?

496
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,534
Why did she address you as honey?

497
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,536
Well...

498
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,330
She is a neighbor of mine.

499
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,749
She believes that
she is betrothed to me.

500
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,751
Of course, it is not true.

501
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,794
It is complicated.

502
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,591
"Betrothed"?

503
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,344
You are in love with a lady
yet betrothed to another girl?

504
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,554
You are just amazing.

505
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,474
What? What is it?
Why are you staring at me?

506
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,810
Let me ask you one question.

507
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:49,895
What is it?

508
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:53,023
Which one of us do you like?

509
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,822
They say you cannot hold back love.

510
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,158
Either I am a fool
or you are experienced,

511
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,868
but I have no idea how you feel.

512
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:08,747
But then again, I am very curious.

513
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:10,874
What a lunatic.

514
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,627
I was just babbling drunk.

515
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,587
I already heard
about your drinking habits.

516
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,757
Then whom do you think it is?

517
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,592
Do you seriously think that
I would like a man who has a lady,

518
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:21,802
is betrothed to another girl,

519
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,303
and is living in disguise
as a woman?

520
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,563
You are right.

521
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:41,238
Fine, then. Let us go.

522
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,532
You can go.
I am not coming with you.

523
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,756
Why is he so curious about that?

524
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,726
My goodness!

525
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,024
Right.

526
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:18,984
How could it be me?

527
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,153
There is no way.

528
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,822
I did not ask
because I had feelings for her.

529
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,991
I was just curious...

530
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,868
about why she had said
such a ridiculous thing.

531
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:29,661
How funny.

532
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,748
Nok Du... No, no.

533
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,834
Sister?

534
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:41,507
What are you mumbling to yourself
so early in the morning?

535
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:43,800
What?

536
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:45,844
"Morning"?

537
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,808
How dare she stay out all night?

538
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:53,769
How dare she?

539
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,236
Gosh.

540
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,450
I am sore. Gosh, my back.

541
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,466
What am I doing this for?

542
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,508
I will let you have it,

543
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:07,843
honey.

544
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,430
You two are very much in love.

545
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:12,639
Aeng Du,

546
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,516
what did I say will happen to me
if you call me that?

547
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:16,894
You told me that you will die.

548
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:18,979
Hey, little kid.

549
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,772
Do you even know what marriage is?

550
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:22,107
Yes, of course.

551
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,109
It is when you eat
three meals a day,

552
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,611
have fun,

553
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:27,070
and always spend time
with someone.

554
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,947
Yes, that is correct.

555
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,782
It is someone you will be
with for the rest of your life.

556
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:33,785
So you should meet a great man
who is upright and kind...

557
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,787
once you grow up in the future...

558
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:38,874
instead of a useless punk like him.

559
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,878
He is good enough for me.

560
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,049
Aeng Du, here you go.

561
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,509
Eat up.

562
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:49,927
Okay.

563
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,341
Is she planning
to sleep outside again?

564
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,011
Let me go!

565
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,721
How dare you do this to me?

566
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:17,723
- Your Majesty.
- Let me go!

567
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:25,147
I do not know anything.

568
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,399
What curse?

569
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,401
What conspiracy?

570
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:30,903
Let me go!

571
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,738
I am the Queen Dowager!

572
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,740
His Majesty gave us orders
to escort you to the West Palace.

573
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:35,824
Let us go.

574
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,869
I want to see Prince Yeongchang.

575
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,287
My baby!

576
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:41,955
My child!

577
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,214
No!

578
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:53,300
Please let me meet His Majesty!

579
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,636
Please!

580
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,138
Brother!

581
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:00,849
Mother!

582
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,435
Mother!

583
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,020
Will this be okay?

584
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,817
You will become a target
to those who do not agree with this.

585
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,654
Decisions are always
followed by consequences.

586
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,782
I will make sure I stay safe.

587
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,659
So do not worry.

588
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,226
My gosh.

589
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,729
Oh, goodness.

590
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:31,899
My back hurts so much
that I cannot sleep.

591
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:33,859
You know what?

592
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:36,653
I do not need to sleep here.
I can just sleep in the house.

593
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,632
Why did this have to happen
while you were gone?

594
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:59,218
His Majesty purposely waited
until I was gone.

595
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:00,260
He has been doubting me...

596
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,970
ever since the incident
that happened on the island.

597
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,890
"The island"?

598
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,270
I will go first.

599
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,605
Borrow a horse
from the gisaeng house...

600
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,814
and follow me.

601
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,191
Yes, my lord.

602
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,534
Was he the one who tried to kill us?

603
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,911
But he also mentioned His Majesty.

604
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,122
Why would the King
be interested in us?

605
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,967
(20 years ago,
A village in Gyeonggi Province)

606
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,762
Why did you have to be born
on the 19th of November?

607
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:47,391
Why does it have to be today?

608
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:04,116
Your Majesty.

609
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,535
How did this tragedy happen?

610
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:08,328
No one shall find out...

611
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:11,707
about what happened today.

612
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,419
Jung Yun Jeo took...

613
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,881
my dead son.

614
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:24,011
I want you to get rid of them both.

615
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:35,772
Go.

616
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,066
I will report that you buried
the dead baby...

617
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,027
and that I stabbed you,

618
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,738
and you fell into the river.

619
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,365
So live as if you do not exist.

620
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:47,868
Live like you are dead.

621
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:49,828
Mother.

622
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:52,873
Father will be here soon
with medicine.

623
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:54,124
So please hang in there.

624
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,667
Where is the medicine shop?

625
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,419
Go that way.

626
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:01,882
Are you not Jung Yun Jeo?

627
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:04,426
Surely, you must be mistaken.

628
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,762
Yun Jeo died during the war.

629
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,307
But His Majesty seemed happy
to hear it.

630
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,064
I want you
to visit the Muweol Corps.

631
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,316
There is someone
we need to find and kill.

632
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,777
- Pardon?
- His Majesty will look for him too.

633
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:25,781
We must find him first at all costs.
Do you understand?

634
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,658
Yes, my lord.

635
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,037
If His Majesty finds him first,

636
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,790
that will be
the end of our great plan.

637
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,296
Who was that man?

638
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,048
And what does the King
have anything to do with it?

639
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,759
What in the world is going on?

640
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:35,309
Let me turn on the light for you.

641
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:36,894
I am sure it will be fine.

642
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:38,604
No.

643
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,190
We must follow the rules.

644
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:45,194
Why are you so scared...

645
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:46,737
of the dark?

646
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,822
Who says I am scared?

647
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,663
I told you not to do that.

648
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,790
We just have to make sure
they cannot see it from outside.

649
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:41,667
What do you think?

650
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,253
Even ghosts with good eyes
will pass by our house.

651
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:48,549
Stop whimpering and go to sleep.
It is quite noisy.

652
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:57,391
What? What is it? Go to sleep.

653
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,310
Do not be nice to me.

654
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,149
Why not?

655
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:08,902
- You should be nice...
- Only to people I like?

656
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:15,242
People I am concerned about
and keep thinking about?

657
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:19,329
Yes.

658
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:22,165
Like you and your lady.

659
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:31,592
I cannot hide it anymore.

660
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:33,802
You know what? I do not have...

661
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:34,887
I am going to sleep.

662
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:03,248
Love is like a cough.
You cannot hold it back.

663
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,127
I am in big trouble.

664
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,328
I decided not to waste time
on pointless things.

665
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,834
No, I will not.

666
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,712
I cannot.

667
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,232
Nice.

668
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:11,817
Look at you.

669
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,528
My gosh. How do I look?

670
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,530
- Here it goes.
- Okay.

671
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,785
Is it in? Is it?

672
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:26,790
- You look nice.
- Really?

673
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:27,958
You look beautiful.

674
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:34,840
What is the occasion?

675
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,091
Goodness.

676
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:37,718
It is Dano, the 5th day
of the 5th month.

677
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,595
Dano, Dano,

678
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,388
Dano.

679
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,223
Dano?

680
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,642
What do people do here on Dano?

681
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,728
It is all the same.

682
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,146
We pluck mugwort and motherwort.

683
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,189
- We pluck them.
- We pluck them.

684
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:51,982
We wash our hair in the iris water.

685
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,150
- We wash our hair.
- We wash our hair.

686
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:56,361
And at the market,
the ladies and the men...

687
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,906
- go wild.
- Go wild.

688
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:01,408
They go wild?

689
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:03,410
You know what it is.

690
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:06,455
Their eyes meet at the swing.

691
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,790
- And they share their feelings too.
- Gosh.

692
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:13,128
Well, it has nothing
to do with us though.

693
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,672
I see.

694
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:16,798
Even so...

695
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:20,928
- Dano, Dano, Dano, bright Dano
- Dano, Dano, Dano, bright Dano

696
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,304
- Aeng Du.
- Give me that.

697
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:23,639
- Dano, Dano
- Dano, Dano

698
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,148
Today is Dano.

699
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,276
Yes, I know.

700
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,654
Let us go to the market
and ride the swing tonight.

701
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:39,988
I need to tell you something.

702
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:47,913
I do not want to hear it.

703
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:53,752
Why not?

704
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:55,879
Hearing it will be pointless.

705
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:02,219
Do you know
what I am going to tell you?

706
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,888
Yes. It is obvious.

707
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:08,308
But...

708
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,771
you will not even hear me out.

709
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,859
Is it because of Cha Yul Mu?

710
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:21,864
Yes.

711
00:55:58,775 --> 00:55:59,776
Open your mouth.

712
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,806
Here. Open it.

713
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,478
Chew it slowly.

714
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,123
You can eat more?

715
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,877
I am not even close to being full.

716
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,171
Okay.

717
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,842
Eat it until you feel full. Here.

718
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:09,221
By the way, could you
pack this up for me?

719
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:12,724
My brother also likes this.

720
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:16,353
- "Brother"?
- Yes, my bro...

721
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:18,564
Sister!

722
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:22,234
Bro-sister?

723
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:25,946
I meant, sister.

724
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,585
Do not be so discouraged.

725
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:41,837
It is not over.

726
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,380
You still have a chance.

727
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:44,840
Do you really think...

728
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,009
it is not over yet?

729
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,218
Of course.

730
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,804
If we did not think so,
why would we drink with you?

731
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,639
It has not been decided yet.

732
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:54,683
Are you already giving up?

733
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:56,310
I guess so.

734
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,691
It has not been decided yet.
If I choose not to do it,

735
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,151
who will benefit from this?

736
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:13,410
What on earth is she talking about?

737
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:15,746
Hey, get up.

738
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,915
Let us go and wash our hair
in the iris water.

739
00:58:17,998 --> 00:58:19,041
No.

740
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,293
I had better go home.

741
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,711
Come with us.

742
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:25,839
No one will be in the village.
Everyone will be on the mountain.

743
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,593
(Brewery)

744
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:32,846
Walk straight.

745
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:35,599
I am walking straight.

746
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:38,727
Goodness. What is wrong with her?

747
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:40,187
Do you want to look?

748
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:42,314
See? I am walking straight.

749
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,859
- No!
- No!

750
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:51,907
I was walking straight.

751
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,713
What on earth happened to you?

752
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:08,841
I fell.

753
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,009
I am going to wash up.

754
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,454
Who are you?

755
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:42,499
I am sorry about that.

756
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:43,917
Lady Kim.

757
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:46,420
- Yes?
- He has given me this...

758
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:49,047
to wish you a happy birthday.

759
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:21,747
Can you go home alone?

760
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,999
I cannot go in as I am a man.

761
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:26,043
I see. You too?

762
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:30,756
Goodness, why is this village
so mean to men?

763
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,551
I can understand.
Only women live in this village.

764
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:39,139
That is why I cannot see
my father as much as I want.

765
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:43,435
And my brother became my sister.

766
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,741
I do not like anyone.

767
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:01,370
What?

768
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,288
What about the lady...

769
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,710
Did you lie to me?

770
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,840
- Yes.
- Why are you telling me that now?

771
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,552
I like you.

772
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:17,970
That is why.

773
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:24,268
I made myself very clear.

774
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:25,727
I...

775
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:32,901
I know you do not like that jerk.

776
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,695
You say that you like him.

777
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:36,613
And it only makes sense that you do.

778
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,283
But I do not believe that you do.

779
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:41,869
What?

780
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,747
He said it cannot be concealed.

781
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,959
Yes, I could not conceal it.

782
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:53,463
And you have never coughed
in front of him.

783
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:56,633
What are you talking about?

784
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:58,135
He might be looking at you,

785
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:01,096
but you are not.

786
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,849
You are looking at me.

787
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:06,852
Is that not true?

788
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:13,150
I do not wish to answer that.

789
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:17,237
Why do you keep asking me
such questions?

790
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:19,031
You know nothing.

791
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:23,202
Yes, that is true.

792
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,329
I know nothing.

793
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:27,247
So...

794
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,566
So answer me.

795
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:23,804
Gosh.

796
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:55,878
(The Tale of Nokdu)

797
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,130
I guess you are traveling far.

798
01:03:58,213 --> 01:03:59,506
There is a 60th birthday party.

799
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,258
We plan to raise a ruckus there.

800
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:04,803
They would never think that
working women will be assassins.

801
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:06,513
Time is of the essence.

802
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:09,183
Tell Sook that
we have fallen into a trap.

803
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,649
- It is hot.
- Lady Kim?

804
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:19,526
The boss sent me here.

805
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:23,155
You must be plotting
something again.

806
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,282
It has been a while.

807
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:28,660
Now, I can leave.

808
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:30,662
Do not go. Do not go.

809
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:31,955
I told you not to be clingy.

810
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,498
I will continue to be clingy.

811
01:04:33,582 --> 01:04:35,709
So do not leave.
