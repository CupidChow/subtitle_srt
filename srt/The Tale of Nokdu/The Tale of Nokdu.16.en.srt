(Episode 31)

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,367
Make sure you catch him...

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,119
no matter what.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,913
Yes, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,893
No.

10
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,562
I will catch him myself.

11
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,054
Nok Du, are you all right?

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,683
I had to take...

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,144
your father outside the palace,
so I am a bit late.

14
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,687
Is he all right?

15
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,355
He is all right.

16
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,648
What about you?

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,150
Are you all right?

18
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,695
Yes. This is nothing for me.
So tell me.

19
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,822
The King is really here?

20
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,659
You must take my brother
and Dong Joo outside the palace.

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
What about you?

22
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,121
I need to stop by somewhere.

23
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,706
Okay.

24
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,542
Escort her safely. Be careful.

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,927
No. Let me go with you.

26
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,224
We do not have time to waste.
Come quickly.

27
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,436
Go.

28
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,827
Oh, no. How...

29
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,789
I am all right.

30
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,708
You must leave the palace
for the time being.

31
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,710
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,879
His Majesty...

33
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,090
has returned.

34
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,509
What?

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,053
How...

36
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,015
So are his men after you?

37
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,350
Yes.

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,068
There is an exit out of the palace
in the backyard.

39
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,153
Court Lady Kim.

40
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:16,947
Show him the way.

41
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,198
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,367
Please follow me.

43
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,119
Okay.

44
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,663
You must come with me, Mother.

45
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,307
No one is at the Queen's Chamber.

46
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,812
I have an idea
where he might be hiding.

47
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,272
Follow me.

48
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,823
What do you mean?

49
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,577
Why can you not come with me?

50
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,372
How could I leave you
in this dangerous place?

51
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,542
His Majesty cannot kill me...

52
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,379
as I am...

53
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,633
the only one left at his side.

54
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,053
What about me?

55
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,597
I finally...

56
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,725
got to meet you, Mother.

57
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,354
It pains me more than death...

58
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,191
to let you go.

59
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,944
Then, why?

60
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,780
- Why?
- It is because...

61
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,158
I am the Queen.

62
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,286
My husband may be cold-hearted...

63
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,956
and cruel,

64
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,959
but he is the King.

65
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,212
If I leave him like the others,

66
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,675
he will soon be ruined...

67
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,094
by those despicable men.
Do you not agree?

68
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,013
That cannot happen.

69
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,933
Mother.

70
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,734
Nok Du.

71
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,280
No matter what people say,

72
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,909
you are the most precious son...

73
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,328
to me.

74
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,791
Only remember that,

75
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,753
and wash away the wounds.

76
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,214
And go somewhere far from here...

77
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,386
and live freely.

78
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,020
Will you do that for me?

79
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,194
We will meet again one day.

80
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,279
I promise.

81
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,864
So...

82
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,992
please stay alive.

83
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,996
You must.

84
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,708
Come this way. Hurry.

85
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,051
I also know that
you used to stay here...

86
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,804
when you were the Crown Princess.

87
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,890
Where is he?

88
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,851
How long...

89
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,230
will you keep acting like an animal?

90
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,398
How dare you!

91
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,358
Your Highness!

92
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,737
If any of you move,

93
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,991
I will cut my own throat.

94
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,952
If you want to kill me,

95
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,371
do so.

96
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,000
Kill me first...

97
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,880
before you go on your way
to kill your son!

98
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,814
This is it.
You must leave right now.

99
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,445
Please understand the Queen.

100
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,281
In order to guarantee your safety,

101
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,950
she has to stay.

102
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,952
That is why she told you to go.

103
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,040
Please be safe.

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,252
Is he sleeping?

105
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,382
There they come.

106
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,675
Look.

107
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,427
Hanyang is in chaos right now.

108
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,638
Bring Aeng Du with you
and get on the boat.

109
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,015
But Nok Du is still out there.

110
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,268
I told him to hide somewhere
if things go awry,

111
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,269
so I will go there right now.

112
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,146
Take your father and Aeng Du first.
Can you do that?

113
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,731
Hold on.

114
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,775
What are you doing?

115
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,861
I am truly grateful for all
that you have done.

116
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,196
Do forgive me for not being able
to repay you.

117
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,365
You should also leave.

118
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,242
Staying here will not do you
any good.

119
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,248
Hurry up!

120
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,044
Wait. What are you doing?

121
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,965
These feeble men
cannot take care of this young girl.

122
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,049
Forget it.

123
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,427
We will do our best to help.

124
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,639
I agree. Let us go to the end.

125
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,349
Wait.

126
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,768
Get on the boat.

127
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,770
Give it to me.

128
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,439
Hurry.

129
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,399
Get on the boat now.

130
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,484
Hurry up.

131
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,529
Hurry. All right.

132
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,464
Do not go.

133
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,594
Hold this for me, will you?

134
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,225
What are you still doing here?

135
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,436
Go on your way. Be safe.

136
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,022
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

137
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,754
- Nok Du.
- Yes?

138
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,925
I am fine.

139
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,469
What do you mean?

140
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,348
Why do you always say that?

141
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,934
Do I?

142
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,436
Then...

143
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,689
I am not fine.

144
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:34,027
It hurts so much
that I may die from the pain.

145
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,913
You should have hugged me sooner.

146
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,168
I feel a bit better now.

147
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,341
You should not fall asleep.

148
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,555
I will not.

149
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,058
I am going to talk with you.

150
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,354
What should we talk about?

151
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,321
Since when...

152
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,532
did you like me?

153
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,834
How could you ask
such a thing right now?

154
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,256
You liked me...

155
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,385
ever since we lived together
at the village for widows, right?

156
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,149
Why would I have liked a man
who dressed like a woman?

157
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,489
If we went back to those days,

158
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,370
would you stop liking me?

159
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,357
This is blood.

160
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,526
I believe they went that way.

161
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,676
If...

162
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,224
we went back,

163
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,478
I am going to run away with you
no matter what.

164
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,357
I will make sure you do not
find out about anything...

165
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,694
or about who I am.

166
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,744
We are going to run away
to a place where there is no one.

167
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,787
And...

168
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,176
Are you listening?

169
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,472
Are you?

170
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,061
No, Nok Du... No...

171
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,647
No...

172
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,277
Nok Du.

173
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,285
- Nok Du...
- Nok Du.

174
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,435
Oh, no!

175
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,115
We cannot go this way.

176
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,957
Master, what is the matter?

177
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,835
If you keep going this way,
you will find a river.

178
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,212
There will be a boat
tied up by that river.

179
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,799
Do you think
you can take Nok Du there?

180
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,260
What do you mean?

181
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,762
I will do my best to buy some time.

182
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,347
So stay hidden...

183
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,266
and do what I just told you.

184
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,034
And one more thing.

185
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,496
This might be a bit too much to ask.

186
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,960
But...

187
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,630
once you meet Aeng Du...

188
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,174
I cannot take Nok Du
all the way to the river.

189
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,969
- What?
- We will get caught on our way.

190
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,764
You know it is impossible for you
to hold them back on your own.

191
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:55,974
Then all three of us will die.

192
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,436
Are you thinking of...

193
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,065
I am merely trying to survive.

194
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:12,950
Please make sure...

195
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,869
Nok Du lives.

196
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,243
He is dead.

197
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,624
Are you trying to buy him time?

198
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,793
Did he send you to do this?

199
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,170
Let us just say...

200
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,505
he got killed by your sword...

201
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,049
while he was being chased.

202
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,389
If you do that for me,

203
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,479
I will stay by your side.

204
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,649
You will stay by my side?

205
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,903
Do you even know what that means?

206
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,365
I will not let you go anywhere.

207
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,826
I will keep you hidden
for the rest of your life.

208
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,995
Yes, go ahead.

209
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,414
I do not care.

210
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,474
He is not here. Let us go.

211
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,473
He got swept down
by the river,

212
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,058
and we found his body
by the riverbank.

213
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,228
You stabbed him,

214
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,773
and his body got swept down
by the river?

215
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,568
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,327
But you still managed
to bring me his body.

217
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,792
Forget it.

218
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,921
He got swept down
by the river for days.

219
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,174
I will not be able to recognize him.

220
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,513
And surely, you would never...

221
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,641
try to deceive me.

222
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,149
Would you like to try it?

223
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,240
Forget it.

224
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,908
If you do not want to...

225
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,504
Does it taste good?

226
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,259
Yes, it is delicious.

227
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,580
You agreed to do everything.

228
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,629
Yes.

229
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,132
I will wait.

230
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,468
So give me your sincerity.

231
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,726
I lied when I told you
that your sincerity does not matter.

232
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,061
You can take as long as you wish.

233
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,355
I want your sincere heart.

234
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,027
That is the only thing I ask of you.

235
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,988
I can lie...

236
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,117
and promise you that I will do that.

237
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,077
But...

238
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,706
you and I both know...

239
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,250
that one's sincerity...

240
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,212
and affection for someone...

241
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,341
are not something one can work on.

242
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,229
Stop.

243
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,349
You may go now.

244
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:21,670
Dong Joo.

245
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,788
I told you not to do anything.

246
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,207
It will be fine as long as no one
can see us from outside.

247
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:41,875
What do you think?

248
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,503
Even ghosts with good eyes
will pass by our house.

249
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,799
Stop whimpering and go to sleep.
It is quite noisy.

250
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,494
What are you doing?

251
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,705
Why did you not light the candle?
It is dark here.

252
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,790
You were alive.

253
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,502
You were alive.

254
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,004
Of course.

255
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,673
I promised you that I would be back.

256
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,939
I am sorry that I am late.

257
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,093
you and I both know...

258
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,303
that one's sincerity...

259
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,306
and affection for someone...

260
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,394
are not something one can work on.

261
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,445
My lord, if we delay a bit longer,
we will lose them.

262
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,613
Should I go after them?

263
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,199
No. There is no need.

264
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,516
Goodness.

265
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,186
I did not know my daughter-in-law
was such a good runner.

266
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,314
My precious son died because
you did not support him well.

267
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,691
Then, you should obey me
without making a fuss.

268
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:36,109
How dare you run away?

269
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,529
Goodness. You little...

270
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,740
Gosh.

271
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,744
Goodness.

272
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,830
What is this? My nose is bleeding?

273
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,625
How dare she hit me?

274
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,561
Oh, no.

275
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:12,729
What...

276
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,358
She is not my daughter-in-law.

277
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:31,290
May I ask who you are?

278
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,671
- My lord.
- My lord.

279
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,133
Were you scared?

280
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,178
Everything will be okay now.

281
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:48,807
I was really glad...

282
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:52,019
that he decided to help us because
he wanted to return the favor.

283
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,021
He is enjoying this.

284
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,439
He enjoys pretending...

285
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,816
to be a widow
and beating up fathers-in-law.

286
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,528
Having him is as good as having
10 people for our other missions.

287
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,488
Well, let him enjoy this a bit.

288
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:12,372
She does not have a place to go.

289
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,374
Accompany us to the village.

290
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,377
You can share the room
with Lady Jang.

291
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,630
Who are you to decide that?

292
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,259
Thank you so much.

293
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:28,096
I will never forget your kindness.

294
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,643
All right. I will get going now.

295
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,228
I will see you at the wedding.

296
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,604
You know what?

297
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,231
We will be taking the boat tomorrow.

298
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,815
Sleep over and we can go together.

299
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,652
No.

300
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:42,819
Why not?

301
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,115
Because I miss him.

302
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,622
You cannot eat your meal
because you miss him?

303
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,251
It has been only four days
since he left.

304
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,586
He was supposed to come yesterday.

305
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,422
As you saw,
the waves were really rough.

306
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,132
I doubt that he could take a boat.

307
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,717
I know that,

308
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,387
but I still miss him.
What am I supposed to do?

309
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:12,140
I did not peg her
to be so inconsiderate,

310
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,893
but she can be very insensitive
toward the widows.

311
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:18,230
She rubs salt into my wound
when the boat is supposed to come.

312
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,900
He is coming!

313
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:25,404
Gosh. You...

314
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,283
Be careful.

315
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,623
Nok Du must be here.

316
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,757
Nok Du!

317
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,055
You will trip. Slow down.

318
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,856
- I will kill him.
- Let them go.

319
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,192
My gosh. Just let them go.

320
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,986
This is my karma.

321
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:57,079
Why did you buy these?
These are expensive!

322
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,790
I was going to wear them
at our wedding.

323
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:00,958
It was supposed to be a surprise.

324
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,793
Why are you never patient?

325
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:05,587
You have not changed.
You do not know how to save money.

326
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,506
Do you know ho much money
you spent on our wedding?

327
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,050
Why can you not be more romantic?

328
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,927
We will have our wedding only once.

329
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,220
What is so bad
about spending a bit of money?

330
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,847
I make money to spend it.

331
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,311
Look.

332
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,355
You have bought
all of these for me so far.

333
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:25,315
Is this little? Is it?

334
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,610
What could I do? I knew they would
all look good on you.

335
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,698
Fine, I am sorry.

336
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,826
So let us set them all aside...

337
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,244
and do it.

338
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,413
What?

339
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,039
You know...

340
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,876
The thing we were going to do...

341
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,670
No, thanks.

342
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:48,797
Why not?

343
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,800
Everyone is busy preparing
for our wedding.

344
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,344
Go help out.
I need to clean this room.

345
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,429
Gosh.

346
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,572
This is nice.

347
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:22,039
I said we should break up
on the spur of the moment.

348
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,792
She said, "Sure," then packed
her things and left.

349
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,002
Goodness.

350
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,089
These rings look just fine.

351
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,550
She is not romantic at all.

352
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:39,431
How could a woman
not understand a man?

353
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:43,352
I came all the way here
just because of her.

354
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,479
Gosh.

355
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,814
Had I not been enchanted...

356
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:50,984
by her luscious eyes
back at the ferry,

357
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,903
I would not be in this situation.

358
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,404
"Not been enchanted"?

359
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,576
Hey...

360
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,745
Whatever.

361
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:03,789
Why are you back?

362
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,290
I thought you had abandoned me.

363
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:08,919
Quit that nonsense and follow me.
Let us talk back at home.

364
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,129
Whatever.

365
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,215
All right.

366
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,134
I will give you three seconds.

367
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,221
1, 2, 3. Here I am.

368
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:21,223
Gosh.

369
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,308
- All right.
- Oh, my.

370
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,143
What are you doing?

371
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,062
I feel like a baby.

372
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:34,444
Gosh, that is embarrassing.
What are they doing?

373
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,825
Look who is talking. You are
the most romantic one here.

374
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,785
- Whatever.
- What is it this time?

375
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:42,870
Did you get scolded again?

376
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,162
Do not be ridiculous.

377
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,790
I got mad at her and left.

378
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:51,837
What is it?

379
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:54,548
I am just happy...

380
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,593
that we are living together
once again.

381
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,138
Me too.

382
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:04,433
I am glad that we three
can live together again.

383
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:05,893
And...

384
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,855
I am thankful and sorry toward you.

385
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,440
Really?

386
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,859
Then should we annul
your marriage...

387
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,069
and live together with Father?

388
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,362
Like the good, old days?

389
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,031
What are you saying?

390
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,951
Hey, how about this?
You should get married as well.

391
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,079
What do you think about Mal Nyun?

392
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,461
- No, thanks.
- Then...

393
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,171
what about Sook?

394
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,139
Do not be silly.

395
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:47,351
What? What was that?

396
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,604
- It was nothing.
- What is this? You must like her.

397
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:51,939
Stop trying to get me to like them.

398
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,668
Smile.

399
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,548
How pretty.

400
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,385
Whatever. You must be exhilarated.

401
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,971
Yes, I am.

402
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,889
That is funny.

403
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:34,059
You once told me not to get married
to a jerk like him.

404
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,603
Looking back,

405
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,481
it seems like you have been
scheming everything since then.

406
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:40,732
You sure have.

407
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,401
Is that so?

408
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,778
Come on, now.

409
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,407
Hey, do not be ridiculous.

410
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:55,205
Forget about it. Just take
good care of him, will you?

411
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,040
He may be immature,

412
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:00,127
but he is a good guy,
so be happy together.

413
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:04,173
Live a lovey-dovey life, all right?

414
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,925
I will. Thanks.

415
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,641
Hold on.
The rice cake has yet to come.

416
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:17,352
Do not start just yet!
Here is the rice cake!

417
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,149
- Goodness.
- My goodness.

418
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,568
- Goodness.
- I am fine.

419
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,613
What a ludicrous situation this is.
All right, then.

420
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,031
I am fine.

421
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:30,616
- Gosh.
- All right.

422
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,076
Tidy your clothes. I am fine.

423
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:40,459
- Oh, no!
- Goodness!

424
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,169
- Oh, my.
- I am fine.

425
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,253
I am fine...

426
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:47,090
- Gosh.
- The wind is strong.

427
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:54,056
Here comes the bride!

428
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,516
Gosh, she is beautiful.

429
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,327
All right. I will now start
the wedding ceremony...

430
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,538
of Jun Nok Du, the groom,

431
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:03,542
and Dong Dong Joo, the bride.

432
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:07,754
The bride and the groom
will love each other.

433
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:11,258
In order to do that,
they will need to...

434
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,343
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

435
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:16,054
Get that! I spent all night
writing that!

436
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:17,973
- Oh, no.
- I cannot lose that!

437
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:20,017
The wind is very strong today.

438
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,643
My goodness.

439
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:25,647
- Goodness, what is this?
- What is going on?

440
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:28,859
Oh, dear.

441
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:29,943
All right, now.

442
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,039
Maybe today is not their day.

443
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,083
Do not jinx it.

444
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:49,588
But you know what?
The weather is lovely.

445
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:58,764
Please give them
your words of blessings.

446
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:03,519
- No, thank you.
- That would be great.

447
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:15,155
Before we begin,

448
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:20,035
let me share some advice.

449
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,414
Marriage...

450
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,875
is when two different people meet...

451
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,670
and spend the rest
of their lives together.

452
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,464
You must always respect each other,

453
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:33,966
care for each other,

454
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:37,719
be patient
and understand each other.

455
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:41,056
Then you will be able to overcome
all types of obstacles...

456
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:43,308
and difficulties that come your way.

457
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,436
Therefore, I trust
that the two of you...

458
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,480
will always love
and depend on each other...

459
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:52,067
until death do you part...

460
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:54,903
in sickness and in health...

461
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,906
and remain faithful regardless of...

462
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:01,952
whatever situation you may be in...

463
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:04,162
My goodness.

464
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:09,293
My gosh.

465
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,003
Oh, my gosh.

466
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,177
My goodness gracious.

467
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,971
What is this nonsense?

468
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,514
- My gosh.
- What a mess.

469
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:25,726
My gosh, what is with the wind?

470
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,088
Will you get over it already?

471
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:39,341
I do not care how the wedding went.

472
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:45,264
I wanted to give you everything.

473
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:48,934
I wanted to do
everything we never got to do...

474
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,061
including the stuff
we had to give up.

475
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,481
I wanted to fill your life...

476
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:58,527
with good memories and make you
forget about the bad ones.

477
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,366
I wanted to give you the ring...

478
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:05,993
and solemnly swear...

479
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,786
that we will be together...

480
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,872
for the rest of our lives.

481
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:12,749
Let us do that here.

482
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,084
What?

483
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,709
Nok Du.

484
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,379
I do not think
the time we spend together...

485
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:02,216
will only be filled
with happy things.

486
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:04,426
Just like today,

487
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:07,095
we might have to face
an unexpected windy day.

488
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:11,141
And there will be times
when we cry and feel like giving up.

489
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:13,268
But...

490
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:16,605
as long as we are together,

491
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,452
I will gladly endure
all those difficult days...

492
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,497
regardless of what it may be.

493
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,128
Okay.

494
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,257
I will do the same.

495
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,511
I will gladly endure it all.

496
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:59,147
I love flower rings.

497
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:07,614
You see,

498
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,034
there is something
I wanted to do at the wedding.

499
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,245
What is it?

500
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,151
What are you doing?

501
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:28,946
I am writing to my mother...

502
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,614
to let her know that we got married.

503
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:35,596
(9 years later)

504
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:01,390
You are here.

505
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:10,065
I thought you were smarter than me.

506
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:12,401
But I guess I was wrong...

507
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,279
seeing that you willingly...

508
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:18,991
decided to set foot
in this fiery pit.

509
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,995
Why did you let me live?

510
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:27,958
If I had not let you live,

511
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:31,837
I would have become a father...

512
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,673
who killed my innocent son twice.

513
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:36,091
You think...

514
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,428
I was born
during the Japanese invasion.

515
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,933
November 19.

516
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,436
That is...

517
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:51,231
my actual date of birth.

518
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,777
I was born on the exact same date
as your son.

519
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:01,283
A royal offspring
that is born on November 19...

520
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,952
will become the next king.

521
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:06,955
If my father had failed
to hear that,

522
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:09,041
I would have died.

523
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,793
But I am still alive.

524
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:14,630
And just like
what the prophecy said,

525
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,132
I am going to become the king today.

526
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:22,054
And you will eventually...

527
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,475
lose your throne.

528
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:45,160
Can you do me a favor?

529
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:09,142
I will accept my fate...

530
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,103
and my end.

531
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:15,065
If I have to be reminded of my fear
for the rest of my life,

532
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,943
I will do so.

533
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:20,696
But...

534
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,574
I will...

535
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:29,496
be the only one bearing them.

536
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:36,211
Let...

537
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:40,215
the Queen leave the place...

538
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:43,802
without anyone's knowing.

539
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:48,724
I will do so.

540
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,690
You will be lonely.

541
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,115
You will be lonely...

542
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,745
and continue to be lonely.

543
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:49,493
You will be lonely.

544
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,372
You will be lonely...

545
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,749
and continue to be lonely.

546
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,640
(Grand Prince Neungyang
raised a revolt.)

547
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:13,851
(The Queen will head to the island.)

548
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:24,653
Nok Du.

549
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:28,699
I do not know...

550
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:32,411
how I am supposed to feel.

551
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:37,249
I want to cry, but I do not
at the same time.

552
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,213
Come here.

553
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:44,965
Pardon?

554
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:02,524
You can cry.

555
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,111
Or you do not have to cry.

556
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,325
I will follow my heart too.

557
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:48,070
Are you nervous?

558
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,033
- A bit.
- I am very nervous.

559
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,202
- Why?
- Just because.

560
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:57,496
I wonder how she will think of me...

561
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:00,165
and if she will like me.
Stuff like that.

562
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,752
How could she hate you?

563
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:04,962
Gosh.

564
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,215
Right? Look at me.
I am so pretty. She will like me.

565
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,178
You were the one who saved me.

566
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,183
- Come on.
- That is true.

567
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,436
You said you wanted
to live a happy life with me...

568
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:23,856
and that you would wait.

569
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:25,858
That day,

570
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,486
what you said
saved me several times.

571
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:33,198
I feel the same way.

572
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:37,035
I will continue to live
a happy life with you...

573
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,787
for the rest of my life.

574
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,960
So when you are having a hard time,
come to me and cry.

575
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:49,298
When there are happy occasions,
we can smile together just like now.

576
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:54,219
- Here.
- Gosh.

577
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:04,605
I see a boat.

578
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:31,131
Let us go.

579
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:09,211
(Just like that,
they lived happily ever after.)

580
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,505
(Thank you for watching
The Tale of Nokdu.)

581
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:13,507
(Always be happy
with your loved ones.)

582
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:24,393
(We thank Son Byung Ho
for his guest appearance.)
