(Episode 23)

6
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,757
Who is there?

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,031
Chief Administrative Officer...

8
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,175
Your Majesty!

9
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,179
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,806
Please go back in.

11
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,016
It is not true, right?

12
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,268
Please tell me it is not true.

13
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,519
I told you to go back in.

14
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,354
I will if you tell me...

15
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,190
that it is not true.

16
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,400
Please tell me
that the awful thing...

17
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,903
I just heard is nothing but a lie.

18
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:51,945
Stop.

19
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,448
There is no truth
for you to find out.

20
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,699
So go back now.

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,868
I must hear...

22
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,460
I must hear
what he could not finish.

23
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,962
Where is he?

24
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,797
Take the criminal immediately.

25
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,799
And no one except for me...

26
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,344
will be allowed to visit him
in prison.

27
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,678
Yes, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,388
Your Highness.

29
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,101
No.

30
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,020
I must hear the rest of it.

31
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,523
What are you doing?
Escort her to her room.

32
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,732
Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,821
I do not wish to go back in.

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,156
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,824
Let go of me.

36
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,743
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,912
Your Majesty!

38
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,830
Your Majesty.

39
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,460
Get up.

40
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,629
Who on earth are you?

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,428
I came here
as you have called for me.

42
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,561
It is all right. I know her.

43
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,315
Were you lost?

44
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,071
She seems shocked.
Walk her to her room.

45
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,406
I will call for you again.

46
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,949
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,503
What is this now?

48
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,136
That is...

49
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,807
Open it.

50
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,077
Give it back to her.

51
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,717
Dong Joo.

52
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:29,353
(The Tale of Nokdu)

53
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:49,915
Are you all right?

54
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,626
He was the King.

55
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,630
He was not
the Chief Administrative Officer.

56
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,590
The King.

57
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,175
Were you that surprised?

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,095
I should have given you a heads-up.

59
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,639
When did you find out?

60
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,516
When I got my certificate.

61
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,019
His Majesty told me
not to tell you...

62
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,521
because
you might feel uncomfortable.

63
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
Sorry.

64
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,610
We had a meal together.

65
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,156
And we talked...

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,243
and laughed.

67
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,289
Goodness.

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,166
No, it is all right.

69
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,294
He is not the type to be offended
just because we had...

70
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,045
a meal together
and talked to each other.

71
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,631
What kind of person is he then?

72
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,552
What is he like?

73
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,184
Make sure you find Jung Yun Jeo.

74
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,519
I give you permission...

75
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,938
to kill him if necessary.

76
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,774
You just need to bring
his corpse to me.

77
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,861
I truly wish...

78
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,655
that you will never find out...

79
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,659
what kind of person I am.

80
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,497
He gets afraid.

81
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,791
And I am curious about him.

82
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,669
I also pity him.

83
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,094
I get to see...

84
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,055
all kinds of stuff
because I work for him.

85
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,600
But you really have
nothing to worry about.

86
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,938
His Majesty cherishes you very much.

87
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,357
He is not the type
to get the wrong idea about that.

88
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,483
It is all right.

89
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,782
You get scared easily.

90
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:50,661
But...

91
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,539
what were you doing
at such a late hour?

92
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,832
Did something happen?

93
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,128
No.

94
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,216
It is nothing.

95
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,135
Nothing.

96
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,099
Okay, fine.

97
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,446
It is not that you do not know,

98
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,282
but you choose not to tell me.

99
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,910
You will not tell me...

100
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,620
where you hid that boy?

101
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:34,913
Right.

102
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,124
It will not be easy
to get you to talk.

103
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,208
I am well aware of that.

104
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,085
Is making me talk...

105
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,797
the hard thing to accomplish?

106
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,092
Or are overcoming that nasty fear
of yours and stopping...

107
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,012
this kind of heinous act
the hard thing to accomplish?

108
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,471
"Fear"?

109
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,557
"Heinous"?

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,725
Yes.

111
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,435
You even believed...

112
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,353
a ridiculous story...

113
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,106
that Yun tried to dethrone you
by putting my son in your seat.

114
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,859
What are you so afraid of?

115
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,863
Must I show you
what you ought to fear?

116
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,865
Yes. Please show me.

117
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,075
You should also throw out...

118
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,119
my body after you kill me
in cold blood.

119
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,204
Fine.

120
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,975
If this can get you out
of this false delusion,

121
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,229
I will die for you a hundred times.

122
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,317
How dare you look down on me?
You too?

123
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,195
Fine. I will make you
a spiteful ghost.

124
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,572
You and Yun were best friends.

125
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,741
And now, you can accompany
each other to the afterlife.

126
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,136
Your Majesty!

127
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,513
Call the physician.

128
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,348
- Yes, master!
- Your Majesty.

129
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,268
What happened to His Majesty?

130
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,979
Is the physician with him?

131
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,231
He is stable now,

132
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,775
but I do not think you will be able
to visit him.

133
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,612
I know you were summoned
to drink with him,

134
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,281
but I do not think it is possible.

135
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,492
Yes. I understand.

136
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,996
By the way, what happened?

137
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,082
It is not something I can disclose.

138
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,126
I see.

139
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,713
Then I shall go now.

140
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,195
His Majesty cherishes you very much.

141
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,782
He is not the type
to get the wrong idea about that.

142
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,296
I am not allowed to enter?

143
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,840
It is the King's order.

144
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,843
I have something to give back
to Her Highness.

145
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,719
It will not take long.

146
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,388
You should leave.

147
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,230
Have you finally realized
how dangerous your plan is?

148
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,981
I was aware of it.

149
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,858
You could have died last night.

150
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,194
I was ready to die.

151
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,196
How could I dare to survive...

152
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,365
when I plan to kill someone?

153
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,411
Does that guy know
what's on your mind?

154
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,998
I am sick and tired of telling you
to mind your own business.

155
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,671
Lie low until next month.

156
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,383
Do not ask any questions
and just do as I say.

157
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,594
What will you do next month?

158
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,097
Are you going to harm Nok Du?

159
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,934
Must you talk about him right now
when I'm worried about you?

160
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,771
If you want to know,
stay alive until then.

161
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:34,940
Lord Yul Mu.

162
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,912
I wonder if you will
still be able...

163
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,375
to love him so earnestly
once you find out who he is.

164
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,031
I looked into it,
and Her Highness...

165
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,365
had already been waiting...

166
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,451
outside the palace
to meet with him.

167
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,829
That means they had already spoken
to each other beforehand.

168
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,833
I doubt he has anyone here
who can be his messenger.

169
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,085
Who do you think helped him?

170
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,088
Should I look into it?

171
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,093
It is more important to find out
how much the Queen knows.

172
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,054
Was there anything else?

173
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,140
No, my lord.

174
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,560
Keep an eye out for any news.

175
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:54,811
Yes, my lord.

176
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,237
It seems like you have something
to tell me.

177
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,865
A revolt will take place soon.

178
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,201
Once a new era begins,

179
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,496
is it certain that the Muweol Corps
will have a place there as well?

180
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,750
Of course. I will keep my promise,
so do not worry.

181
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,919
I need proof...

182
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,088
of what you have just told me.

183
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,298
Why don't we help each other?

184
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,388
I'm sure he's prepared something to
keep the people under his control,

185
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,014
so that they would not back out.

186
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,600
"To keep the people
under his control"?

187
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,685
That is correct.

188
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,063
I am sure they did not trust Grand
Prince Neungyang completely either,

189
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,606
so they must have
wanted proof as well.

190
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,402
For example,

191
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,989
a list of names
of those who are involved?

192
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,824
For them, it may be a merit list.

193
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,825
But once I get a hold of it,

194
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:50,909
I will be able to use it
against them.

195
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,788
It's the proof of their conspiracy.

196
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,000
I will find it.

197
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,044
Proof?

198
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,675
All right.

199
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,262
I'll take it as your promise to
trust me and be loyal until the end.

200
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,858
I will summon you again,
so you may leave for now.

201
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,611
Yes, my lord.

202
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,618
- Let us have another glass.
- Okay.

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,585
You were right.

204
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,462
There was a merit list.

205
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,381
Did you find out where he put it?

206
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,680
(Kim Sook)

207
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,224
A key?

208
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,102
I am certain he carries it with him
all the time.

209
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,312
So how could we take it from him?

210
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,106
I will think of a way.

211
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,733
As you already know,
the one who stole...

212
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,819
Lord Park's elephant statue is me.

213
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,408
Aseowon closes at 1am,
so come by then.

214
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,160
It is best that you see it for
yourself and observe the perimeter.

215
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,329
It would be even better
if you could come up...

216
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,455
with a solution by then.

217
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,457
Okay, I will see you later.

218
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,433
So what we had witnessed...

219
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,602
was true.

220
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,149
Why is she at the palace?

221
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,151
If she gets caught,

222
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,153
both we and she will die.

223
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,719
I bet all you ever do
to have fun in Hanyang...

224
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,429
is to play on the swings.

225
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,390
You are like a girl
from the countryside.

226
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,268
Look who is talking.
You are from an island.

227
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,103
All you ever do is have fun diving.

228
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,271
Diving?

229
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,815
That is way too lame.

230
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,567
Then what do you do to have fun?

231
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,235
Have you ever surfed before?

232
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,738
You should have seen me ride a wave
that was as big as a house.

233
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,323
Stop bluffing.

234
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,284
How could a wave
be as big as a house?

235
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,828
And even if there is such a wave,
how could you possibly ride it?

236
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,162
You are no Dragon King.

237
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,459
It is a pity that I cannot
show it to you.

238
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,756
How about we go
to the beach right now?

239
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,508
What?

240
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,469
Is it too far away?

241
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,348
It is either one of the two.

242
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,641
You either cannot surf,

243
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,560
or your affection for me
has withered.

244
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,270
What are you talking about?

245
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,855
It is neither.

246
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,940
It is because I need to do
something important.

247
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,610
Fine.

248
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,029
It must be something
much more important than me.

249
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,656
No, that is not it.

250
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,700
I was just kidding.

251
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,911
The beach is way too far away.

252
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,954
And I really need to go back anyway.

253
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,582
You are already late,
so let us eat together.

254
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,875
You can meet the family as well.

255
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:54,755
And I promise I will take you
to the beach next time.

256
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,676
Let us go and eat.

257
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,930
- What? Hey, wait.
- There we go.

258
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,848
Hey, everyone is looking.

259
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,517
- Stop it!
- Oh, gosh. Wait.

260
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:10,979
Oh, dear.

261
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,067
What? Is that yours?

262
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:16,902
Well...

263
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,445
Where is the other piece?

264
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,658
I do not know.

265
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,369
I am not sure. Let us go.

266
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:26,912
I know what that is.

267
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,706
- What?
- It is...

268
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,208
a token of love.

269
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,920
Who gave that to you?
You really had a lover, right?

270
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,755
What are you talking about?

271
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,507
No, I did not have a lover.
Let us get going.

272
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,633
You look flustered.

273
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,176
You really had a lover?

274
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,263
You are so suspicious.

275
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,348
I really did not have anyone.

276
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,559
What in the world...

277
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,279
My goodness.

278
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,407
My gosh.

279
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,500
Wait a minute.

280
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,174
You do not have a fever.

281
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,263
And your eyes look fine.

282
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,473
I know it is hard to believe.

283
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,187
So you are going to stop
the conspiracy,

284
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,189
help Hwang Tae escape,

285
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,566
and you are also the son?

286
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,401
The son of the King? His Majesty?

287
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,487
So you are the prince?
The Crown Prince? You?

288
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,408
Yes, I think so.

289
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:49,870
My goodness.

290
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,748
This is crazy.

291
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,708
- My gosh, stop...
- No, do not stop me.

292
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,004
You would never joke about this.
I mean...

293
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,881
You would never
joke about this, Your Highness.

294
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,591
But are you really...

295
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,469
This is driving me crazy.

296
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,887
Master, please do not be like this.

297
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,138
I do not want
to be like this either.

298
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,849
But I cannot help
but be polite to you.

299
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:13,852
Master.

300
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,146
You need to help me.

301
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,940
Well, of course...

302
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,399
No, wait a minute.

303
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,693
You are right. I should help.

304
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,780
I should help you as your master.

305
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,758
You should wait
until the egg hatches...

306
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,554
Oh, my gosh.

307
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,931
Aeng Du, what are you doing?

308
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,268
Now that you are here,

309
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:57,479
Nok Du will fry an egg
and hide it beneath your rice again.

310
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:02,192
I will not let him fool me
this time around.

311
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,652
My goodness.

312
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:04,945
You are really...

313
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:06,738
My gosh.

314
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,076
I will walk you back.

315
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,911
Sure. Go ahead.

316
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,162
Can I carry you on my back?

317
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,540
No, you cannot.

318
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,710
My goodness! No!

319
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,503
Oh, gosh.

320
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,637
- What is it?
- What is the matter?

321
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,181
- What is wrong?
- You see,

322
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,932
Bok Nyeo worked so hard
to make this.

323
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,601
But Aeng Du got her hands on it.

324
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,146
We made it too.

325
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,356
It is okay.

326
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,108
She is just a little kid.

327
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,861
But look at how ugly it looks now.

328
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,362
You worked so hard to make it.

329
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,324
My gosh, you will end up eating
everything you see.

330
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,867
Why would you
go into that smelly room...

331
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,577
and eat that fermented soybean lump?

332
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,371
I know, right?
What were you doing in there?

333
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:57,789
What about you, Bok Nyeo?

334
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,374
And you, my lord?

335
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,710
Were you guys in there together?

336
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,423
While I was eating
that fermented soybean lump,

337
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,259
the two of them came in together
holding their hands...

338
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,886
- like this...
- Okay, that is enough.

339
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,721
You must have been very hungry.

340
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,223
You should have told me.
That is enough.

341
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,307
Stop it.

342
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,726
You two are unbelievable.

343
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,520
What were you doing
in front of a little kid?

344
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,021
What? We did nothing.

345
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,523
I personally think...

346
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,150
you and Dong Joo were a lot worse...

347
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,693
Hey, wait!

348
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:27,945
Eat this.

349
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,571
Have another bite.

350
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,827
My gosh, she is so...

351
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,914
- Where is she going?
- I will give you something to eat.

352
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,332
Let us go. Come on.

353
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,418
What is the matter?

354
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:44,670
What are you doing?

355
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,004
- Ladies, hear me out.
- What are you doing?

356
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,923
This is all a misunderstanding.
You have got it all wrong.

357
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,467
- Come on.
- What do you think you are doing?

358
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,736
Did anything happen between you...

359
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,405
and Grand Prince Neungyang
after that day?

360
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,491
Why would you bring him up?

361
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,993
I am about to get an upset stomach.

362
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,078
I am just telling you to be careful.

363
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,538
He is a dangerous man.

364
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,165
It really felt like
he was going to harm you.

365
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,335
- Because of me, you might get...
- I will not get harmed.

366
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,422
You are not responsible
for anything he does.

367
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,549
And I will be the one...

368
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,968
to make the first move,
so do not worry.

369
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,553
What are you planning to do?

370
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,806
It is something I must do.

371
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,808
It is nothing dangerous,

372
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,226
so do not worry.

373
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,149
If you are going to keep
staring at me like that,

374
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,568
how about you give me a kiss?

375
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,703
Your Highness.

376
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,664
You cannot leave your room.

377
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:04,208
- Your Highness.
- Unhand me.

378
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,169
My norigae is gone.

379
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,630
I am sure I dropped it that night.

380
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,797
I must find it this instant.

381
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:11,882
It was the royal command.

382
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,217
How dare you?

383
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,177
Move out of my way now.

384
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,970
If I do not find it,

385
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,224
I will not forgive you.

386
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,267
Get out of my way now
if you do not wish to die!

387
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,853
Your Highness.
Please do not make a scene.

388
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,147
Court Lady Kim.

389
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:29,942
My norigae...

390
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,156
My norigae is...

391
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,838
She is the new servant, is she not?

392
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,548
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

393
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,258
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

394
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,552
As I cannot return to my room,

395
00:27:56,635 --> 00:28:00,681
I asked her to bring me clothes
and herbs for the knees.

396
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,475
Right.

397
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,605
You can go there
without raising any suspicions.

398
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,193
Could you look for something?

399
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,445
Sorry?

400
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,129
It is a half of a norigae.

401
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,131
You will recognize it at once.

402
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,716
It is very dear to me,

403
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,302
so please find it.

404
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,226
How will I find that tiny thing?

405
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,314
Come to think of it...

406
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,318
Is that yours?

407
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,237
What were you saying?

408
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:00,824
What are you looking for?

409
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,492
It is nothing.

410
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,495
By the way, where did you get...

411
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,456
that norigae?

412
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:09,249
What?

413
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,960
Why do you ask?

414
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,796
Did you pick that up at the palace?

415
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,382
No, I didn't.

416
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,676
It is from my mother.

417
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,387
I see.

418
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,849
Why are you here anyway?

419
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,395
Come to the swing by 9pm tonight.

420
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,314
I came to tell you this.

421
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,650
- Why?
- You wanted to see the ocean.

422
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:35,734
So let us go.

423
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,277
Don't be ridiculous.

424
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,445
Let us go.

425
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,406
If we travel throughout the night,
we will be able to see the sunrise.

426
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,116
It is beautiful.

427
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:52,209
You must come with me.

428
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,169
Okay?

429
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,506
Okay.

430
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,968
You have to.

431
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:07,474
I will go now. Goodbye.

432
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,404
What did you just say?

433
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,449
I said that he is the son
the King had abandoned.

434
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,952
How could he commit such
a heinous act to take the throne?

435
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,912
He was the heir.

436
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,164
The King could have handed over
the throne when the time came,

437
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,249
so why?

438
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,585
That was because he was not
the king during that time.

439
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,421
We do not need to worry about that.

440
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,755
Here are the facts.

441
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,425
The King attempted to kill
his newborn son,

442
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,302
and the son is still alive.

443
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,930
And he is nearby.

444
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,517
So this is the new cause...

445
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,019
that you mentioned before.

446
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,189
However, the King has no idea
and is still looking for his son.

447
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,108
In fact, he still wants to kill him.

448
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,235
That is too wicked.

449
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,154
I am aware that brothers
and children...

450
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,822
fight over the throne, but...

451
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,699
Once the truth is exposed,

452
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,410
it will hurt the King's reputation.

453
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,330
How should we go about this?

454
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,334
I have found a way.

455
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,712
Have you?

456
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,088
Yes.

457
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,050
It is this.

458
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,644
Is it possible?

459
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:37,022
Did you say that the lock looked
like an upside-down bowl?

460
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,190
That is correct.

461
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,400
I will try to make it work.

462
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:41,860
The chief administrative officer...

463
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,320
from our smithy
is asking for a favor.

464
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,032
- Me?
- Of course.

465
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:53,205
By the way, what will you put
inside this stinky thing?

466
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:56,166
I would like to fill it
with fine soil.

467
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,585
There is a pottery shop
at the end of the alleyway.

468
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:59,962
You should go there.

469
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,843
Their meeting will end soon.

470
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,594
I will begin my mission right away.

471
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:10,430
I have a plan
and someone who can help me.

472
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,891
Will you be okay?

473
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,185
Even if it was not for you,

474
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:17,020
I had no plans
to continue working for him...

475
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,605
after finding out Grand Prince
Neungyang's true identity.

476
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,482
If you need a hideout...

477
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,526
We will find a place,
so do not worry.

478
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:24,903
Take care of the rest.

479
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:31,827
Of course.

480
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:36,290
I will bring that man
to the King tomorrow.

481
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,473
He will be very shocked...

482
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:56,268
when he realizes that his son
whom he was desperate to find...

483
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,770
had been near him all along.

484
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,565
However,

485
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,775
he will be elated.

486
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,153
Because...

487
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,201
he will finally be able to kill him.

488
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,172
What do you say?

489
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,424
Blinded by his heinous greed,

490
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,551
the King will kill his son twice.

491
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,096
No one will be able
to side with him.

492
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,224
Then...

493
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:39,144
how are you planning to catch him?

494
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,315
Everyone has a weakness.

495
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,909
Catch the little girl and her father
this instant.

496
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,077
Yes, my lord.

497
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,328
Goodness.

498
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,289
Master, the horse ran off.

499
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:01,500
- What?
- I tied him up,

500
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,336
but the rope came undone,
and he ran away.

501
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,172
Please wait here, my lord.

502
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,255
She loves me more!

503
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:54,011
You are of no match to me.

504
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:56,388
You little scumbag. Hey.

505
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,056
Are you done talking?

506
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,517
No, I am not!

507
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,020
How dare you talk
about my dear Yeon Sim?

508
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,063
"My dear Yeon Sim"?

509
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,774
You little scumbag. Take that!

510
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,360
- You little...
- You punk!

511
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,154
You little...

512
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,906
You punk!

513
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,538
- Goodness. Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

514
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,831
Are you all right?

515
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,169
My lord, are you okay?

516
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,671
I will prepare your bath water
and a new set of clothes.

517
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,089
Please follow me.

518
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,196
I can change on my own.
Get me some cold water.

519
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,697
Yes, my lord.

520
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,195
My lord, here is your water.

521
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,461
What... What is wrong?

522
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,392
Was there anyone else here?

523
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,311
Sorry?

524
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:11,398
Are you asking if there was
anyone else except us?

525
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:19,990
No. No one came in.

526
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,242
How did the calm horse
manage to run away?

527
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,286
And why was the lead undone?

528
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,358
Hey.

529
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:19,776
I am here.

530
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,986
Who are you?

531
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:23,113
You do not know?

532
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,577
Do you really not know who he is?

533
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,913
Who are you?

534
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,748
I... I am...

535
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,833
I guess you do not know.

536
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,294
You must really not know him.
Then you do not need to know.

537
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,505
From what we know,
there is a man living here...

538
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:43,675
who has fair skin, a pretty face,
and looks very arrogant.

539
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,594
Tell him to come outside.

540
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:48,096
- My goodness!
- My gosh.

541
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,182
I asked to see a man,
and you present me with swords.

542
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,767
There was a party today,

543
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,560
- and he had a lot to drink.
- How dare you?

544
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:54,645
My goodness!

545
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,522
What do you think you are doing?

546
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,318
Let us all calm down.

547
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,201
There you are!

548
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,245
Hey, look at me in the eyes.

549
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,580
I see that I have the right man.

550
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,500
You were at the palace
a few days ago, were you not?

551
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,211
Well, yes.
But I never met you before.

552
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:22,339
I do not care. You were leaving
on a horse,

553
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:25,551
and you broke my amethyst ring
that I had dropped by accident.

554
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,845
But you just ran away that day,

555
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,430
so I asked around
and barely managed to find you.

556
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,059
Do you have any idea how precious
that hat string was to me?

557
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,603
Pardon? "Hat string"?

558
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,981
But you just said it was a ring.

559
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:40,899
What?

560
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,277
A ring.

561
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:44,820
Well...

562
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:50,158
My gosh, that dumb fool.

563
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,537
Well, then...

564
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,375
My gosh, what was that?

565
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,132
Let us do this.

566
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:08,552
One more time.

567
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,096
What in the world...

568
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,058
Why am I bleeding so much?

569
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,020
I am bleeding!

570
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,898
Call the police bureau!

571
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,316
I am bleeding!

572
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,168
There is no one here.

573
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,295
There is no one here?

574
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,509
Dan Ho, let us go to my place.

575
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,195
My gosh, what is taking him so long?

576
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,663
There is our prince.

577
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:22,042
You cannot go! Oh, gosh!

578
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,213
There is no need to be startled.

579
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,965
I am okay.

580
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,509
We received a report
about a commotion.

581
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,264
My gosh, my nose is bleeding.

582
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:37,474
He broke my precious belonging
and pretended like he was innocent,

583
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,226
so I came here
to confront him about it.

584
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,229
But look at what he has done.
He totally beat me up.

585
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:43,939
You should arrest him right now.

586
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,277
This is the private house
of Grand Prince Neungyang.

587
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,904
And he is his close friend.

588
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:52,906
Grand Prince Neungyang?

589
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,449
Yes, that is correct.

590
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:58,912
So what?

591
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,708
Do you think he can be free
from getting punished...

592
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,335
just because he is
Grand Prince Neungyang's friend?

593
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,005
Arrest him.

594
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:09,214
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

595
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,371
I already told you
that you are too late.

596
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:43,165
This is completely useless.

597
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,291
You will not be here for long.

598
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,752
This is the safest place for you.

599
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,212
What?

600
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:49,755
Tonight,

601
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,466
Grand Prince Neungyang
will be finished.

602
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:53,842
Nok Du.

603
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:55,511
What are you planning this time?

604
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,763
You will get released tomorrow.

605
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,890
You can hide for a while
and leave...

606
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,016
once the chaos dies down.

607
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:03,977
I will be off now.

608
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:39,179
How is the Queen doing?

609
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:43,141
She has not said anything
in particular, Your Majesty.

610
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:47,646
And nothing else has happened?

611
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,273
No, Your Majesty.

612
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:53,318
But the young
chief administrative officer...

613
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:56,029
frequently came to visit you.

614
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,532
Are you talking about Officer Yeon?

615
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,492
Yes, Your Majesty.

616
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,911
Did he have something to tell me?

617
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,873
No, not exactly.

618
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,186
Did I come here too early?

619
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,315
I should go and surprise him.

620
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,206
He came because he was worried?

621
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:50,375
Yes, he asked me
what was bothering you,

622
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:52,419
if you had gotten any better,

623
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,421
and if you had eaten anything.

624
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,882
He asked me questions
every time he came.

625
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,805
I know it is very late,

626
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,432
but will you call him for me?

627
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:09,102
Tell him to come and see me
as soon as he comes to the palace.

628
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,063
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,487
How is the prisoner doing?

630
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,197
He refuses to eat anything...

631
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,241
or drink a single drop of water.

632
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,117
He is barely holding up.

633
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,747
He is trying to die
without my permission...

634
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:32,167
while I am bedridden like this.

635
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,212
I will not let that happen.

636
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,298
I must go see him right now.

637
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,396
Here you go. You should hurry.

638
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,076
(Merit List)

639
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:04,718
(Jung Yi Hyung)

640
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:05,802
(Kim Sook)

641
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:14,520
Hurry.

642
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,043
Dong Joo.

643
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,170
What brings you here?

644
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:42,464
What brings you here?

645
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,471
Are you here to see Nok Du?

646
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:58,313
People he was staying with
disappeared as well.

647
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,732
Do you really not know
where he has gone?

648
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:04,528
I do not know.

649
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:08,156
But why are you
looking for him and his family?

650
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,575
That is none of your business.

651
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:13,412
What are you up to now?

652
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,291
Are you that worried?

653
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,252
Yes, I am worried...

654
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,504
because you keep throwing
a temper tantrum.

655
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:26,967
Temper tantrum?

656
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:32,222
Please stop getting Nok Du
involved between you and me.

657
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,184
To me, he is...

658
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,397
Please, I am begging you.

659
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:48,947
Who is he to you?

660
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,491
Pardon?

661
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,160
Should I tell you?

662
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:05,297
(Merit List)

663
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:25,192
Everyone, out.

664
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,236
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

665
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,831
This is too bad.

666
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,210
I came
before you could kill yourself.

667
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:47,714
You do not seem scared...

668
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:51,009
just like the old days.

669
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:56,598
20 years ago, do you remember...

670
00:50:57,683 --> 00:51:00,602
fleeing the capital
when there was an invasion?

671
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:03,480
You were bright...

672
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:06,149
and brave then.

673
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:08,819
I had to be.

674
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:12,281
I was sick of being
the black sheep of the family.

675
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,117
After the invasion,

676
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,537
I ascended to the throne
which I could lose any second.

677
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:22,416
But actually, I was scared...

678
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,419
unlike you who were always brave.

679
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:28,255
I was insanely scared.

680
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:30,549
The fear...

681
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,261
made me stay sane...

682
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:37,723
in that awful battlefield.

683
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:42,227
I was afraid of what
would have happened...

684
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:43,937
if I did not become the King.

685
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:47,065
You are already the King.

686
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,026
Why are you still...

687
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,069
I am still standing in the middle...

688
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:54,281
of the bloodied battlefield
where the arrows are shooting at me.

689
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,410
The former king desperately tried
not to pass the throne to me...

690
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:00,245
until the last moment.

691
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,125
The courtiers were dying
to get rid of me.

692
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:09,213
The people screamed at me
as their lives were hard.

693
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:12,049
And...

694
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:15,177
you and Yun...

695
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,555
abandoned me.

696
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,225
Your Majesty.

697
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:23,977
Yun Jeo.

698
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:28,190
Will I be...

699
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,527
able to die as the King?

700
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,663
I heard that he asked for me.

701
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:46,166
And I also have something
to report to him right now.

702
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,168
Please let me in.

703
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,349
That is why...

704
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:05,102
I must kill...

705
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:08,230
that boy.

706
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,149
Your Majesty.

707
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,944
He is your son.

708
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,531
Even though you tried to kill him,
he still lived.

709
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:19,950
He is your son!

710
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,201
He should not have come.

711
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:22,995
He should not have lived.

712
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:25,080
Your Majesty!

713
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:27,916
I do not have the luxury to have
a son or blood-related family...

714
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,668
to protect my throne.

715
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:31,545
That is the cost...

716
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,174
of the throne.

717
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,264
Where is that boy?

718
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,643
You can't die...

719
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:49,271
before you answer me.

720
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:55,152
(Merit List)

721
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:20,427
What...

722
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:23,722
did you just say?

723
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:27,226
Nok Du is...

724
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:30,896
The King killed your whole family...

725
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,068
and dragged your life to the gutter.

726
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,277
You despise him...

727
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,614
with all your heart and are
desperately trying to kill...

728
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,157
that darn King.

729
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:45,077
He is the King's...

730
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,418
He is the son of the King.

731
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,132
Gosh, this...

732
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,928
It is a half of a norigae.

733
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,847
You will recognize it at once.

734
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:08,267
It is very dear to me,
so please find it.

735
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:12,521
By the way,
where did you get that norigae?

736
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,399
It is from my mother.

737
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:20,279
Tell me.

738
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:24,867
Are you still worried about him?

739
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,744
Do you still love him?

740
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:31,290
Answer me!

741
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,367
I told them to find a place to hide
for the time being.

742
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:10,621
And I will stay behind
and escort him once he is released.

743
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:13,582
By the way,

744
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:18,003
why did he lock his brother up
when he'll be released tomorrow?

745
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:20,672
It is just for one night.

746
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:41,003
How is it?

747
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,255
Not a single ghost
will come in here tonight.

748
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:44,756
What?

749
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,800
If your feet are cold,
you will catch a cold.

750
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:48,177
You will make my life harder
if you do.

751
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:58,645
There. All done.

752
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:01,899
I will not ask you to like me.

753
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,568
You can use me if you want.
I am fine with that.

754
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:06,445
So...

755
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,616
Please do not disappear on me.

756
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:34,473
Why are you so fearless?

757
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:38,018
You do not know
what tomorrow will bring.

758
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,230
That is exactly why...

759
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,774
I say whatever I want.

760
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,569
And I am walking you home
because I want to.

761
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,243
I meant,

762
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,328
why are you crying?

763
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,244
(The Tale of Nokdu)

764
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:02,079
I will save Father no matter what.

765
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:03,705
Will you beg your real father?

766
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:05,207
What are you planning to do?

767
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,167
I will make him shed tears of blood.

768
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,628
He is your father
who gave birth to you.

769
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,881
It must have been
a hard life for you, Lady.

770
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:14,007
You must leave.

771
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,425
If he finds out that you are alive,

772
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:17,177
all of us will be dead.

773
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,554
I will not run away.

774
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:21,431
I will make you a royal bodyguard.

775
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:22,975
A royal bodyguard?

776
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:25,269
He will stay next to His Majesty
and protect him.
