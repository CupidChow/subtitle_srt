3
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,711
I am Dong Joo from Yeonhwa House.

4
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,749
What?

5
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,052
It seems you are happy to see me,

6
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,555
but at the same time,
you are appalled at the sight of me.

7
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,144
Why are you here?

8
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,938
I had something to tell you.

9
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,774
Right now? Here?

10
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,858
Yes.

11
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,779
It perfectly suits
the time and place.

12
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,281
What is it?

13
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,034
So...

14
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,663
starting today, I am...

15
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,004
I am...

16
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,883
your mother.

17
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,971
You are my... What?

18
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,938
I am your mother.

19
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,818
Did I surprise you?

20
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,613
Goodness, of course.
Would you not be surprised?

21
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,117
It is understandable.

22
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,078
I look dashing
in this expensive gown, do I not?

23
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,621
This is making you go crazy, right?

24
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,249
Are you sick? Are you intoxicated?

25
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,877
What do you mean you are my mother?

26
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,795
Dashing, my foot.

27
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,839
How did this happen?

28
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,008
Can you not tell?

29
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,926
You do not need
to be a gisaeng anymore.

30
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,052
You do not want to be one anyway.

31
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,847
Do not be one from now on.

32
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:48,937
(The Tale of Nokdu)

33
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,733
=Episode 7=
That is also the fate of a gisaeng.

34
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,335
=Episode 7=

35
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,579
What is the shortcut
to the guest house?

36
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,372
Pardon?

37
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,140
She and I can be a family.

38
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,727
You want to adopt Dong Joo
as your daughter?

39
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,982
However, how could I let
you take her...

40
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,735
when I know nothing about you?

41
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,113
I can understand your concern,
so I will make a suggestion.

42
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,741
How about Dong Joo and I stay...

43
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,743
in the village for widows together?

44
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,621
Somewhere close to you.

45
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,251
May I ask why you would
go this far to help her?

46
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,797
I am not sure.

47
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,799
Well,

48
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,761
I guess
I have grown affection for her.

49
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,223
I wanted to help her
not do at least one thing...

50
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,309
she does not want to do in her life.

51
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,623
"You, be my daughter."

52
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,792
"Gosh. You are home, my daughter."

53
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,918
"Hey, Dong Dong Joo."

54
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,963
"Starting today,"

55
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,175
"I am your..."

56
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,892
What is this?

57
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,311
I look like a woman.

58
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,329
Why are you doing this for me?

59
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,497
Because...

60
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,960
I must stay
in the village for widows,

61
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,755
but you keep kicking me out.

62
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,091
Is that all?

63
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,344
That is why
you spent a fortune on me?

64
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,553
Of course.

65
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,431
There is no other reason
besides that.

66
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,059
I need...

67
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,686
to meet my lady no matter what.

68
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,774
What is it this time?

69
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,569
Are you really afraid...

70
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,321
that I would take advantage
of women?

71
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,574
If so, it would have been better
to stay at the gisaeng house...

72
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,659
with your fortune.

73
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,579
Then,

74
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,081
are you worried
that I might get caught...

75
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,207
and something might...

76
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,792
happen to me?

77
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,586
Yes, I am.

78
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,255
What?

79
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,468
If they find out,
what would they think of me?

80
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,930
Everyone will think I am crazy
for working with a nasty womanizer.

81
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,431
I will not get caught.

82
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,642
I will leave as soon as I can.

83
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,769
- Do not worry.
- That is impossible.

84
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,229
I still do not understand
so many things...

85
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,522
and have so many questions.

86
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,318
But...

87
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,657
I will help you not to get caught...

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,075
since you got me
out of the gisaeng house.

89
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,493
We will be even then, right?

90
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,169
No. There is one more thing.

91
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,884
What? What is it?

92
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,515
There.

93
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,475
You must pay it back.

94
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,983
"IOU"?

95
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,278
Look at the interest. 70 percent?

96
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,781
Hey, this interest rate
will get you locked up in jail.

97
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,034
No, no. You should have said that...

98
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,535
before you stamped your thumbprint.

99
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,162
Ridiculous.

100
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,538
That is void.

101
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,415
- That will be void.
- "Ridiculous"?

102
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,167
- Give me that.
- How dare you say to your mother?

103
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,003
- Stop talking nonsense.
- You should have been more careful.

104
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,254
- Give me that.
- Dong Joo.

105
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,339
Hey.

106
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,509
Dong Joo.

107
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,560
My lord, what brings you here?

108
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,274
You look beautiful.

109
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,195
What brings you here?

110
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,286
Were you scared?

111
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,413
I came here to get you.

112
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,333
That nasty old man...

113
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,393
Lady Kim?

114
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,775
I was wondering
where that nasty man had gone.

115
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,110
So he took care of the old man.

116
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,822
I thought
he was just an ordinary guy.

117
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,576
I do not know.
How would I know that?

118
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,911
Is he a high-ranking official?

119
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,581
Or is he from a prestigious family?

120
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,501
Forget it. Even if he is...

121
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,628
"Even if he is"?

122
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,631
He is not as handsome as I am.

123
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:51,925
Gosh.

124
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,681
Hey. You should go without me.

125
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,600
I need to wrap things up here.

126
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,226
- I...
- Like what?

127
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,396
Do you think it is easy
to become your mother?

128
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,731
Just go. Hurry.

129
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,261
I knew you were following me.

130
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,763
Why did you quit your task?

131
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,349
I did not quit.
It has been just delayed.

132
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,642
I just thought...

133
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,936
saving her came first
over killing a man.

134
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,271
What?

135
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,857
I am on board with punishing
a corrupt aristocrat.

136
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,194
I could not turn a blind eye
on a powerless woman...

137
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,154
who was forced out to be killed.

138
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,619
However, that was not the promise
you made to us.

139
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,206
You will not complain if I take
your life for your mistake.

140
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,126
I have no regrets
as I saved an innocent girl.

141
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,340
Do you think I will not kill you?

142
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,343
To tell you the truth,

143
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,428
yes.

144
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,098
Based on what?

145
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,642
I know you are curious about me.

146
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,686
I also know that it is a waste
to kill me off.

147
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,271
Am I not right?

148
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,611
I will ponder on whether or not
it is a waste.

149
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,073
However,

150
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,952
if you act out, I will
have your head then and there.

151
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,291
It is a piece of cake
to kill someone like you.

152
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,461
Okay.

153
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,255
I will keep that in mind.

154
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,968
Did you hate becoming
a gisaeng that much?

155
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,220
I am sorry.

156
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,974
Lucky you. You have a great mother.

157
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,476
What? Right, a great mother.

158
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,020
I am thrilled.

159
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,692
My in-laws? Do I need
to write about them?

160
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,652
It is only a formality...

161
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,154
just in case something happens.

162
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,240
Please write their names down
next to your name.

163
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,207
You are the daughter-in-law
of Lord Park Jong Chil!

164
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,125
No wonder.

165
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,920
You looked quite sophisticated.

166
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,254
My lady.

167
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,465
Keep in mind
that your Geun is...

168
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,134
I mean, that I am right over there.

169
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,512
My daughter, shall we go now?

170
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,016
Lady Chun, I will go now.

171
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,100
Please stay healthy.

172
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,103
I will. Good work thus far.

173
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,359
Come visit us often, okay?

174
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,568
Okay.

175
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,903
Bye.

176
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,785
All right, you can treat me
like a father.

177
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,955
I will cherish you as if
you are my own daughter.

178
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,209
If anything happens to your mother,
do call me, okay?

179
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,337
Greet me every morning and night.

180
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,131
You little...

181
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:22,094
I am telling you to stay away
from me other than those times.

182
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,680
Look who is talking.

183
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,182
I truly hope that we will not meddle
in each other's lives.

184
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,685
By the way, where is my house?

185
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,991
Are we to stay
in that tiny room together?

186
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,411
And we are living with you three?

187
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,747
That is right.
You can live in there.

188
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,625
Since we will be next-door,
you have nothing to worry about.

189
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,003
Goodness, is it not great?

190
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:00,591
But Lady Chun said
that I would have my own place.

191
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,635
Lady Chun asked us herself
to spare a room for you.

192
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,013
Since you are still unfamiliar
with this place,

193
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,223
she wanted us to help you out.

194
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,726
Unfamiliar? That is ridiculous!

195
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,271
I feel so comfortable already.
It feels like home.

196
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,814
That is right.

197
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,317
I will take good care of my mother,

198
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,985
so any empty house will do.

199
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,111
There are...

200
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,571
none.

201
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,281
Let us go inside.

202
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,159
No.

203
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,952
Wait a minute.

204
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,954
I cannot go inside. Hold on.

205
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,164
Relax.

206
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,208
Hold on.

207
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,584
Goodness.

208
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,513
How about we tell her now?

209
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,847
Let us not drag it on.

210
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,475
Does that mean there will be
four Virtuous Women Corps members?

211
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,393
There is no need to rush.

212
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,438
She needs to unpack.
I am sure she is busy.

213
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,565
Let us take our time.

214
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,494
Where in the world is Deul Le?

215
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,912
I heard nothing about her,

216
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,997
and there are no traces
of her packing.

217
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,874
Do you think something happened?

218
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,543
Do you think it is that punk?

219
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,877
Let us look for her a bit more.

220
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,129
She might have gone on a search
by herself.

221
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,634
By the way, what will you do
about Lady Kim?

222
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,764
I do admire how she sacrificed
her life to save a friend.

223
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:31,932
No.

224
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,642
Rules are rules.

225
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,103
We told her she would lose her life
if she failed.

226
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,397
We should kill her
when the time is right.

227
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,193
It is a waste to kill her, though.

228
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,657
It would be so convenient
to send me your greetings.

229
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,117
You would just need
to turn your head.

230
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,452
Are you kidding me?

231
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,163
I cannot believe we are stuck
in here together.

232
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,874
Have some patience.

233
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,459
We will not be living
like this forever.

234
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,212
Is it only until your lady comes?

235
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,257
Yes, that is the case for me.

236
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,801
But what about you?
You do not have anywhere to go.

237
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,179
What do you mean?
Of course, I do.

238
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,015
I am going to leave this place
when the time is right.

239
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,393
- Where to?
- Do not worry.

240
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,020
I will repay you for whatever debt
I owe you before then.

241
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,647
That is a given.
But where will you go?

242
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,233
Why do you want to know?
It is a secret.

243
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,863
They say there is no use
in raising your kids.

244
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,740
I have just begun,
and I can already understand.

245
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,327
I saved your life, and yet,
you are keeping a secret from me.

246
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,494
Where are you going?

247
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,706
We need dishes if we want to eat.

248
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,416
We only have one blanket as well.

249
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,959
- I will come with you.
- Forget it.

250
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,002
Hey.

251
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,962
I want to tag along.

252
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,883
Daughter, how dare you address me
like that?

253
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,177
Call me, "Mother".

254
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:51,845
Are you serious?

255
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,181
Do you truly want me
to call you like that?

256
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,810
- Oh, no.
- My gosh, that gave me goosebumps.

257
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,812
- That is not right.
- Go.

258
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,819
Here you go.

259
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,700
That is enough, Mother.

260
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,119
All right, my daughter.

261
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,413
We need that.

262
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,831
- Here.
- What?

263
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,085
What? Where are you going?

264
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,631
My dear mother.

265
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,096
Discuss with me
before buying anything.

266
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,181
Why does a servant
spend money so easily?

267
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,351
You can take care of the house.
I will bring the wood.

268
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,686
I do not want to wash the dishes.

269
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,230
If you cook, I will do it.

270
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,816
You can do the laundry,
and I will clean the house, okay?

271
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,734
- Deal.
- Happy now?

272
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,780
Hey, how is this?

273
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,575
What?

274
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:04,960
Do you want one?

275
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,714
No, thanks.

276
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,561
Let us buy two of them.

277
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,105
No.

278
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,231
Why not?

279
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,818
They will grow on me,
and that will not be good.

280
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,237
Let us go now.

281
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,849
What is it?
Do you want to ride the swing?

282
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,937
No, thanks. That is ridiculous.

283
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:33,799
Suicide?

284
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,178
Yes, we could make it seem that way.

285
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,763
Hold on.

286
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,225
I have a daughter
that I need to take care of.

287
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,352
I am the only one she has.

288
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,728
That is not my problem.

289
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,397
She may have broken our promise,

290
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,940
but she saved someone else's life.

291
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,984
Thus, she did not betray us.

292
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,820
How about we give her
another chance?

293
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,072
- I am all for it.
- What will you make her do?

294
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,032
How will you trust her?

295
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,367
I can do anything.

296
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,369
Anything.

297
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,162
Let us not give her
a real mission...

298
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,706
but something
that is just as difficult.

299
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,711
Even if she ruins it,
it cannot affect us.

300
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:20,429
You said your father-in-law
was Lord Park Jong Chil, right?

301
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,227
Where is he
when we have so much to do?

302
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,481
My goodness.

303
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,443
What took you so long?
I am starving.

304
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,112
Well, I am not alone.

305
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,032
Who is here?

306
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,118
Here.

307
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,954
So what if they grow on you?

308
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,706
You should raise them if you want.

309
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,208
Take them.

310
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,603
I told you to discuss with me
before purchasing anything.

311
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,938
I already named them.

312
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,899
What are their names?

313
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,944
This one is Dong Dong.

314
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,363
This one is Dong Joo.

315
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,158
Are you crazy?

316
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,203
I hope the three of you get along
while I am gone.

317
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,705
Are you going somewhere?

318
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,333
I am going to Hanyang
to see my lady.

319
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,086
I got a chance to see her from afar.

320
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,338
Tell the others
that I left to see my family.

321
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,008
What a romanticist.

322
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,345
Where are you going to see her?

323
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:44,555
What?

324
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,349
There is an inn...

325
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,143
right next to the police bureau
in Hanyang.

326
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,353
That is where I will be going.

327
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,113
I also want to go...

328
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:05,826
to Hanyang.

329
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,079
That is where Nok Du is right now.

330
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:11,999
You must miss him.

331
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,168
I wonder what it is.

332
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,294
What do you mean?

333
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,796
Hanyang.

334
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,256
What exactly is it?

335
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,091
If I run really fast,

336
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,801
how long will it take to get there?

337
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,436
(Kim Nok Soon goes to Hanyang.)

338
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,606
You are coming back, right?

339
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,443
How many times have I told you
that I will be back tomorrow?

340
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,362
I will arrange a big party
to celebrate your return.

341
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:43,530
So please do not be late.

342
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,908
No, do not arrange a party.

343
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,746
I will wait for you!

344
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,587
It is nice and comfortable
to be alone.

345
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,590
This is really nice.

346
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,155
My gosh.

347
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,951
He went all the way to Hanyang
just to see her for a split second?

348
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,953
My gosh, what a joke.

349
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,039
(Wicked brat!)

350
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,001
I need a hinge...

351
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,795
to put these together.

352
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,258
Oh, right. Hanyang has...

353
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,051
the best iron in the country.

354
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,346
That place has the best technicians.

355
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,806
Yes, of course.

356
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,891
I do not want to go.

357
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,059
But I do not have a choice.

358
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:57,771
What can I do?

359
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,483
Hanyang has
the best technicians for iron.

360
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,444
I really cannot be bothered to go.

361
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,247
(Inn)

362
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,749
My goodness, hello.

363
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,168
Are you here to stay the night?

364
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,795
May I ask you something?

365
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,507
Did you happen to see someone
with beady eyes,

366
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,842
a pointy nose,

367
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,512
and plump lips?
I am talking about a man...

368
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,891
I mean, did a widow come alone
without a man?

369
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,686
Oh, I know who you mean.
She unpacked in that room...

370
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,188
and went outside a while ago.

371
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,940
- But why do you ask?
- She is my...

372
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,360
She is my older sister.

373
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,914
My gosh, where did he go?

374
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,542
I guess he was excited
to see his lady.

375
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,548
I wonder if he met her already.

376
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,887
So what?
It has nothing to do with me.

377
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:44,127
I heard your father-in-law
owns something very precious...

378
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,712
that is made out of iron.

379
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,756
We heard he cherishes it so much...

380
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,092
that he keeps it in his arms
every time he goes to bed.

381
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,469
I heard it is an elephant...

382
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,679
from Ming.

383
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,640
- You know what it is, right?
- Elephant?

384
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,392
Yes, of course.

385
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,768
I know it very well.

386
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,019
We will give you three days.

387
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,189
Bring that to us.
How you will do that is up to you.

388
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,817
If you fail,
you will die in that house.

389
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,735
And if you run away,
we will find you and kill you.

390
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,737
Your family who lives in Jinhae...

391
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,614
will not be safe either.

392
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,241
Prove to us...

393
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,452
that you are fit to be
a member of the Muweol Corps.

394
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,956
If I fail and end up dying there,

395
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,292
will someone inform you
about my death?

396
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,460
Well, there is a place...

397
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,629
called Aseowon in Yookjo Street.

398
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:30,591
If you die, the people there
will collect your body.

399
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,092
So do not worry.

400
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,389
These women are so tenacious.

401
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,394
Collect my body, my foot.

402
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,729
I will not die.

403
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,359
But...

404
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,529
does anyone even live in this place?

405
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,028
Just a peek.

406
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,156
I will just take a short peek.

407
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,048
Let us go!

408
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,574
You need to stay alert, Eun Seo.

409
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,285
Stay alert, Eun Seo!

410
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:08,957
Eun Seo.

411
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,835
Mother.

412
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,879
- Mother.
- I am okay.

413
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,380
I am okay.

414
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,013
Mother.

415
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:25,349
Mother.

416
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:18,819
Dong Joo?

417
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,659
Hey, what are you doing here?

418
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:28,954
I...

419
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,791
I did not follow you here.

420
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,960
I had my own business
to take care of.

421
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,004
I meant,

422
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,048
why are you crying?

423
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,181
I did not cry!

424
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,391
You did cry.

425
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,851
Why?

426
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,605
Hey, did something happen?

427
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,153
Hey, are you sure
you did not follow me?

428
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,071
You just happened to come
to this inn by coincidence?

429
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:04,823
I did not follow you.

430
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,326
I had to buy something at the forge.

431
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,493
Plus, I did not even know...

432
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:10,370
that this was the inn you mentioned.
Do you want to know why?

433
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,998
Because I have
no interest in you whatsoever.

434
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:14,583
Okay, fine.

435
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,961
Then what did you say to Lady Chun?

436
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,632
- I just...
- I can see right through you.

437
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,300
You told her you were going...

438
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,885
to say hello to my family,
did you not?

439
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,230
I should ask you the same thing.
Why were you at that house?

440
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:39,525
You will not tell me?

441
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:44,112
Well, it was an empty house,
and no one was living there.

442
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,114
I went inside
to ask for a cup of water.

443
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,952
- It is empty?
- Yes.

444
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,914
I do not understand it.
Why were you crying there?

445
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,165
Go to sleep.

446
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,835
You brat.

447
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:01,171
How dare you interrupt your mother
when she is talking?

448
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:02,548
Goodness.

449
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:07,928
Hey, give back my pillow.

450
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,347
You should not have thrown it at me
in the first place.

451
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,893
Just go to sleep. Whatever.

452
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,895
How dare you...

453
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,731
hit your mother's forehead?

454
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,400
Goodness.

455
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,780
Why is it so hard
to pull the wagon today?

456
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:45,174
My lord, your goods have arrived.

457
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,386
There is no need for that.

458
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,439
What happened
to that witch and the jerk?

459
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,149
They are hurrying back.

460
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,151
They will arrive by tomorrow night.

461
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,986
I found out that she went...

462
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,322
all the way to Woongchung, Jinhae
and is hiding with Dol Bok.

463
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,115
How ungrateful.

464
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,659
Make sure
that they do not get away again.

465
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:15,120
I will. I chose a path
from the temple.

466
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,580
They cannot make a scene.

467
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:17,998
I chose a group of men.

468
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,250
They are good with swords
as the palanquin bearers.

469
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,336
You were always prepared.

470
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,631
- Make no mistakes.
- I will not.

471
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,009
Our family will finally be able
to make a memorial stone...

472
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,677
for a virtuous wife.

473
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,056
Are you happy too?

474
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,391
Memorial stone for a virtuous wife.

475
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,938
Darn it. How will I steal that?

476
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,565
By the way,
why did they get caught again?

477
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,693
Whatever.

478
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,660
I experienced this
when I was traveling in disguise.

479
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,995
I was passing by some street...

480
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:59,831
and observed a child.

481
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:03,836
The child was crushing
small insect eggs with his hands.

482
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,838
So I asked.

483
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,257
"Those are just eggs."

484
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,175
"Do you not think..."

485
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:13,220
"it is too cruel to kill them
just like that?"

486
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,097
And this is what the boy said.

487
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,849
What did he say?

488
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,520
"Do they look like
as mere eggs to you?"

489
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:25,399
"To me, they look
like nasty rice weevils..."

490
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:27,359
"that will hatch overnight..."

491
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,237
"and eat up all of our rice grains."

492
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,741
"You do not know anything."

493
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:44,751
That boy...

494
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:48,088
did not even recognize you.

495
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,007
What does that matter?

496
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,092
"No matter how small
or insignificant..."

497
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,510
"these creatures are,"

498
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,679
"if you see a hint of danger,"

499
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,806
"you must step on it
and get rid of it."

500
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,809
He taught me an important lesson.

501
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,397
Do you not agree?

502
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,026
Bok Sil!

503
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:10,777
Bok Sil.

504
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,154
Bok Sil.

505
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,870
You cannot intrude here.

506
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,372
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

507
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,106
I do not care if it is a gem or not.

508
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,192
Stealing it is hard enough.

509
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,949
Then, His Majesty
will not make any more trips?

510
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:59,952
Did you think he made such trips
all the time?

511
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,954
Besides, there was a huge incident
during his last trip.

512
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,205
I would not come here
even if I were him.

513
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,126
- What is this?
- Do you need anything else?

514
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:10,087
No, this is all.

515
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:14,675
The weather has been fickle
the whole day.

516
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,218
What is this?

517
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,807
- It is magnetite.
- What?

518
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,059
It is a stone used in making iron.

519
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,812
This has a unique element
that gets stuck on irons.

520
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:30,190
As long as it is iron,
it sticks to this?

521
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,150
How do you know that?

522
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,736
I might not be a good dancer.

523
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,030
I told you I am very dexterous.

524
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,740
- This is nothing.
- Gosh.

525
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:41,410
Hold on.

526
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:43,662
Gosh.

527
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,748
When iron touches water,
it gets rusty.

528
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,834
Hey, wait.

529
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:51,587
I need your help.

530
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,506
All right.

531
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,009
What do you think? Can you do it?

532
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:58,260
Can you make it?

533
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,346
Let me see.

534
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,396
I thought you were just a lowlife.

535
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:11,064
Were you a thief?

536
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,149
No.

537
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,151
My daughter,
do you not trust your own mother?

538
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:20,574
Actually, I was going to see my lady
from a distance.

539
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,367
I thought I should
at least send her a letter...

540
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,661
that I am okay
and I will wait for her.

541
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,873
- Please.
- Did you write it on an iron plate?

542
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,125
- Do not try to fool me.
- No.

543
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,044
You got the wrong idea.

544
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:33,253
I need to give her something.

545
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,255
This is the only way
since I will be far away from her.

546
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,842
Gosh, forget it. Goodness.

547
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,307
I will deduct it from your debt.

548
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:48,185
How much?

549
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:40,070
I hit it.

550
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,702
Where did he go? I am starving.

551
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,038
Wait.

552
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,040
Goodness. Oh, no.

553
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,208
Put it down.

554
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:56,461
Here is the stick.
You should put the stick there.

555
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,383
Goodness.
If you stay out in the cold,

556
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,051
your coughing will get worse.

557
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,262
I must earn my keep.
I cannot live off your generosity.

558
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,139
Gosh, you cannot even eat...

559
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,724
because you are worried
about Nok Du.

560
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,517
Right.

561
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,103
That is why I must go to Hanyang
even if you try to stop me.

562
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,898
If I need to help him let go
of resentment in his heart,

563
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:17,816
that is also my responsibility.

564
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,193
Let us talk about this later.

565
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:21,278
We should eat first. Okay?

566
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,868
Aeng Du. Hwang Tae. Let us eat now.

567
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,286
Okay?

568
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,498
Aeng Du is not outside?

569
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,751
She went out earlier
to go to the kitchen.

570
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:36,877
What?

571
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,505
This brat missed her mealtime?

572
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,215
That never happens.

573
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:46,512
My goodness. Oh, no. Aeng Du!

574
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:50,140
Aeng Du! You little brat! You...

575
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:52,893
Aeng Du!

576
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,272
No, Aeng Du!

577
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,233
That brat.

578
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,527
Hey, get off the boat this instant.

579
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:05,072
Father, I am going to Hanyang,
so do not stop me.

580
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,865
What did you say?

581
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:12,454
Stop right there!

582
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,122
Hey! Stop!

583
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,043
- Goodness.
- Wait.

584
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:21,296
My goodness.

585
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,924
Oh, dear.

586
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,218
Oh, my.

587
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:27,719
My goodness.

588
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,096
Aeng Du!

589
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:38,897
My lord.

590
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:43,193
I found their hideout.

591
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,153
What do you want me to do?

592
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,534
What? What did you say?

593
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,202
Lady Kim was caught?

594
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,370
Yes.

595
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:54,913
It looks like Lord Park said...

596
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:57,416
that his daughter-in-law
had left home to pray...

597
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,168
and that she is returning tonight.

598
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:02,921
The word on the street is that
his daughter-in-law will get killed.

599
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,465
Does that mean
she is already caught?

600
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:09,178
They will make her kill herself
and set a virtuousness stone.

601
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,347
We should not let that happen.

602
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,099
You are right.

603
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:15,601
I will be back.

604
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,149
Why are you following me?

605
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:25,360
I have made all of them for you.
Are you not going to see your lady?

606
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,906
Well, something has to be done
from somewhere high.

607
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,215
You should ride it.

608
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:50,344
I said, no. I do not want to.

609
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:53,931
But I want to.

610
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:06,109
There is not an ounce of shame
in you.

611
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,447
It is so cool up here.

612
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:15,410
Hey.

613
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:17,079
Ride it. I will push you.

614
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,206
I do not want to.

615
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,375
Why do you act that way?

616
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,211
You easily say, "No.
I do not want it. I do not need it."

617
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,171
I know
that is not how you actually feel.

618
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:29,299
Do not be ridiculous.
What do you know?

619
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,263
I do know.

620
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,098
Know what?

621
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,601
I know that restraining yourself
like so will not do you any good.

622
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:43,063
And I also know
that the breeze is cool up there.

623
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:08,630
Do everything you want to do.

624
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,591
Do not worry
about what others think.

625
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,843
Follow what your heart wishes.

626
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,429
Yes.

627
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,155
Just get on it.

628
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:36,200
Riding it will not kill anyone.
The world will not fall apart.

629
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:37,492
Sit down.

630
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,244
Here.

631
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,414
Here we go.

632
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:54,176
How is it? Is it not refreshing?

633
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:23,617
You swing well.

634
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,202
I never said I could not.

635
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:30,832
It is raining.
You should go to meet your lady.

636
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,919
Right. I should.

637
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:36,046
You should take shelter at the inn.

638
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:38,632
I will return soon, okay?

639
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:56,400
Is your nose longer or is mine?

640
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,822
Why is it raining?
You should not rust.

641
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:21,008
Your trunk is a hand.

642
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:27,431
Is anyone out there?

643
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:29,349
Look!

644
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,311
Look, there is a hole in my ceiling!

645
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:33,896
What is going on?

646
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:36,148
Climb on the roof this instant!

647
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,108
- Yes, my lord.
- Hurry!

648
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,319
My goodness! Hurry!

649
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:42,654
- Go up!
- How could there be a hole?

650
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:45,449
Goodness, you are drenched.

651
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,959
What should I do?

652
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,381
What?

653
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,272
Get... Get that man.

654
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:18,398
Get him!

655
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:21,235
Get him! Catch that man!

656
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:24,947
Catch him! Where did he go?

657
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,289
- Hey!
- Catch him!

658
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,376
Stop right there!

659
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:47,261
- Hey!
- Catch him!

660
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,447
It was an empty house,
and no one was living there.

661
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:10,826
Why do you act that way?

662
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:13,579
You easily say, "No.
I do not want it. I do not need it."

663
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,747
I know that is not
how you actually feel.

664
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:20,252
I know that restraining yourself
like so will not do you any good.

665
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,513
My elephant is missing!

666
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:34,224
Bring me back my elephant!

667
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,727
- My elephant!
- My lord, are you okay?

668
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,272
My elephant! Find my elephant!

669
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:42,024
We will find it, my lord.

670
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:44,943
Lady Kim will be brought here
at any moment now.

671
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,654
What?

672
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:52,993
Why is she here?

673
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,672
Are you dressed that way...

674
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,175
because you started living
in the village for widows?

675
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:20,015
I just happened to borrow
my mother's jacket.

676
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:23,519
But...

677
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,063
what are you doing here?

678
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:28,649
Oh, well...

679
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,611
I did not want anyone else
to live here...

680
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:34,821
or leave this house
to be abandoned...

681
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,865
just in case you came here one day.

682
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:40,035
I guess my efforts paid off.

683
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,999
Back when our parents
discussed our marriage,

684
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,710
I secretly came to see you.

685
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:51,046
I was going to ask them...

686
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,841
to cancel the wedding
if you turned out to be ugly.

687
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,843
But after I saw you,

688
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,220
I begged my father...

689
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,306
to let me marry you
as fast as possible.

690
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,280
If you want,

691
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:20,534
this place can always be yours.

692
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,291
It is all useless.

693
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,045
My lady.

694
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:38,260
I have always wanted
to call you that here.

695
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,431
Even if it may be useless.

696
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:45,517
Please do not call me that.

697
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,605
You do not need
to make things worse.

698
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,524
Now that I am here,

699
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,862
it makes me want to go back
to my old self.

700
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:01,742
I apologize.

701
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:15,380
You kept this place
looking so beautiful.

702
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:18,467
And I thank you for that.

703
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:23,555
But...

704
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,934
I will never come back here again.

705
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:31,522
So please keep your promise
and continue to treat me...

706
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,191
like a gisaeng.

707
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:48,914
I will go now.

708
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:50,207
It is very late.

709
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:52,125
Can I walk you back?

710
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:55,254
I would like to go alone.

711
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:08,767
Why are they alone
in an empty house...

712
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:10,519
at such a late hour?

713
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,188
Dong Joo is unbelievable.

714
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:15,691
She was really cold to him
at the gisaeng house.

715
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:18,151
But she is completely different
now that she is in Hanyang.

716
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:19,278
What?

717
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,196
She had to buy something
at the forge?

718
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:22,781
What a liar.

719
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:47,389
- Who is there?
- My goodness.

720
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:55,355
How dare you do this?

721
00:55:55,772 --> 00:55:58,108
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

722
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,319
Are you going to kill me
holding that?

723
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:04,114
Hurry up and make a move.

724
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:06,200
I am not...

725
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:08,785
in my best mood right now.

726
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:18,146
It is me.

727
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:26,113
What are you doing here?

728
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:30,868
Are you okay?

729
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:32,953
You must have gone through so much.

730
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:34,663
I am okay.

731
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:37,749
But Dol Bok...
Dol Bok got severely injured...

732
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,751
while he tried to stop these men.

733
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,211
I do not know what happened to him.

734
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:45,757
I am sure he is okay.

735
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,176
Calm down for now.

736
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:56,226
Please stop crying.

737
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:58,312
You should hurry up and escape.

738
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:00,314
Is that his lady?

739
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,152
Gosh.

740
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,210
He must be so happy.

741
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:33,931
Lady Kim?

742
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:36,892
Lady Kim.

743
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:39,228
Let us escape.

744
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:41,271
Hey! Hey!

745
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:43,524
What is wrong with her?

746
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:47,152
Sook! Sook!

747
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:48,237
What?

748
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,988
- "Sook"?
- Yes, hurry.

749
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:51,281
- Hurry up.
- My gosh.

750
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,200
Let us go this way.

751
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,044
Lady Sook saw me.

752
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,087
I think she mistook me for you.

753
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,171
What?

754
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:08,382
She will be suspicious
if I run away.

755
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:14,054
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

756
00:59:15,556 --> 00:59:16,640
Lady Kim?

757
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,519
You should run away.

758
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,521
I will try to do what I can.

759
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:24,606
What are you doing?
I told you to run.

760
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,191
- You should go inside.
- Why?

761
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,609
- Just get inside.
- What are you doing?

762
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:29,862
- Hurry up and go.
- Hey, wait.

763
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:47,713
Lady Kim.

764
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:50,632
- Hey.
- Gosh.

765
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:51,758
No.

766
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:58,432
Just stay still.

767
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:00,893
Gosh, that hurts.

768
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:02,978
Stay still.

769
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,031
Lady Kim.

770
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:16,783
Do not move.

771
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:18,202
Hold on.

772
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:20,120
Hey.

773
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,964
Lady Kim, are you inside?

774
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:43,936
My gosh. Goodness.

775
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:55,405
Who are you?

776
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:40,158
(The Tale of Nokdu)

777
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,159
(Confused)

778
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:43,078
Oh, no. Goodness.

779
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:47,124
How insolent!
How dare you interrupt me?

780
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:48,208
No!

781
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:51,795
(Destroyed)

782
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,470
Honey!

783
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,267
My lord! Hold on!

784
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,393
(Oblivious)

785
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:11,106
My lord.

786
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:17,154
Goodness. I just had a weird dream.
