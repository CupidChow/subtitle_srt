5
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,782
Honey!

6
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,911
She's calling me honey again.

7
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,812
Is someone coming home?

8
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,442
Aeng Du, stop eating for a second.

9
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,068
Hear me out.

10
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,486
What is it?

11
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,655
There is...

12
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,949
something I must do...

13
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,659
outside this island.

14
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,204
- And?
- That's why...

15
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,497
I cannot marry you
and live on this island.

16
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,209
So I mean...
You should tell Master...

17
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,753
that you and I cannot get married.

18
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,131
- Hey, hey.
- I don't want to.

19
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,759
You promised my dad
that you would marry me.

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,885
I only promised...

21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,970
because he would not have taught me
martial arts if I had not.

22
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,766
Hey, how can a little girl
like you be so strong?

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,145
Gosh. Darn it.

24
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,148
Master.

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,818
Hey, my future son-in-law is here.

26
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,112
Goodness.

27
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,822
Please have this fish.

28
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,992
What were you two doing here,
looking so cozy like that?

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,996
Father, he just told me
that he will not marry me.

30
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,790
- Hey.
- What?

31
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,667
She misunderstood me.

32
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,671
I only said that
because she's still so young.

33
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,673
How dare you!

34
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,426
If that's the problem,
I'm totally fine.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,345
You're the youngest man
among the lads on this island.

36
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,513
That's why you're perfect.

37
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,723
You two make the perfect couple.

38
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,102
I see. The perfect couple.

39
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,646
- Darn it.
- Young man!

40
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,356
Nok Du!

41
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,149
Hey...

42
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,486
Your family is in big trouble!

43
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,446
What?

44
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,853
Father.

45
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,683
Who are you?

46
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,394
Father. Hwang Tae.

47
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,979
Are you all right?

48
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,619
Who are you?

49
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,912
Why are you here?

50
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,415
Go.

51
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,750
Go now!

52
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,793
No.

53
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,336
No!

54
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,798
Father. They were trying to harm us.

55
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,424
It will be pointless.

56
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,968
We can just leave this island.

57
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,678
Don't try to find out more.

58
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,555
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,849
I can't let them go like this.

60
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,768
Nok Du.

61
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,854
If we leave, this will go away.

62
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,522
Just forget about this.

63
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,815
Father.

64
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,775
I know everything.

65
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,777
This is all because of...

66
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,280
It's because of me.

67
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,031
It's because I committed a crime.

68
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,157
So...

69
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,708
No.

70
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,377
It's all because of me.

71
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,755
We live our lives
hiding on this island,

72
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,674
we're about to take off again,

73
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,219
and Mother...

74
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,930
had to face such a death
all because of...

75
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,641
It's all because of me.

76
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,985
That's it. Slowly.

77
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,279
Hwang Tae, are you all right?

78
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,699
Luckily, his wound isn't that deep.

79
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,492
By the way,

80
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,912
the way they handled their swords...

81
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,955
tells me
that they are trained assassins.

82
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,875
Who could have sent them?

83
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,255
Master, please take care
of my father and my brother.

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,381
Nok Du.

85
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,927
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,805
Goodness.

87
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,186
You saw how that assassin tried
to commit suicide, right?

88
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,230
Even if you get back at them,
that will not lead you anywhere.

89
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,397
So...

90
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,234
you should follow the assassin
and find the leader.

91
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,277
I will take your father
and Hwang Tae...

92
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,404
to my hometown.

93
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,656
Okay.

94
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,840
A woman?

95
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:23,652
(The Tale of Nokdu, Episode 1)

96
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,488
Move out of the way!

97
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,948
Move aside!

98
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,080
Make way for His Majesty!

99
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,792
Make way for His Majesty!

100
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,512
Here he comes.

101
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,087
Your Majesty!

102
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,672
What is going on?

103
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,549
It came from that way.

104
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,884
Who is it?

105
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,106
What was that?

106
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,112
Darn it.

107
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,959
I am late.

108
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,212
Die!

109
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,011
What was that?

110
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,888
My goodness.

111
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,681
This is my message to the King.

112
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,850
This stone that I've thrown...

113
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,312
is the very stone you used
to bury my son.

114
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,647
It is also the very stone
you used...

115
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,275
to kill my grandson.

116
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,027
Get him!

117
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,030
You have demolished
hundreds of our houses.

118
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,616
You have trampled on the innocent.

119
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,409
You built your palace.

120
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,078
Your Majesty, my foot.

121
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,081
You are not the King...

122
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,338
He must have accomplices. Find them.

123
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:12,881
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,800
Let us go.

125
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,096
- Giddy-up!
- Giddy-up!

126
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,807
Search the surroundings!

127
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,685
- Yes.
- Capture everyone you see.

128
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,855
- Goodness!
- My goodness!

129
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:31,859
Darn it!

130
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,278
Let me go!

131
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,531
I said, let me go!

132
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:39,908
Let me go!

133
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,911
Hey! Let me go!

134
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,664
I found an arrow!

135
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,936
Who are you? Let me go!

136
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,229
Let go!

137
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,360
You better listen.

138
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,905
There! There is someone hiding
in there as well!

139
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,198
Check for yourself!

140
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,202
Darn it!

141
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,599
No!

142
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,448
Take him.

143
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,452
You better listen to us!

144
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,205
Take him!

145
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,000
Follow me!

146
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,127
- Let me go!
- Come here!

147
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,175
Darn it.

148
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,846
What is going on?

149
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,848
Let me go.

150
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,852
- My goodness.
- Please let me go.

151
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,359
Gosh, I was so close.

152
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,072
Hey. I lost him because of you.

153
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,490
Who are you?

154
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,201
Wait. Are you not...

155
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,828
If it was not for you...

156
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,746
Then what?

157
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,499
Darn it!

158
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,043
What are your eyes for?
Why did you run into me?

159
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,254
If your eyes worked just fine,
why did you not move aside?

160
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,965
Because of you, I have ruined
an important task.

161
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,593
I just cannot get through
to this dog.

162
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,386
"Dog"?

163
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,972
Hey, how old are you? Tell me.

164
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,057
I was born in the Year of the Snake.
What about you?

165
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,101
Year of the Snake, was it?

166
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,853
On that year, I mastered
the "Thousand-Character Classic"...

167
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,521
and memorized Confucian texts,
so what?

168
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,647
How dare you?

169
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,441
Be quiet!

170
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,818
How noisy.

171
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,914
- What is going on?
- I do not know.

172
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,201
Look at you.

173
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,873
I am sad that I am the only one
who is witnessing this.

174
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,249
Gosh.

175
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,960
Are you that old man's accomplice?

176
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,545
- What?
- You will be released...

177
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,088
by tomorrow if you have done
nothing wrong,

178
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,423
so why are you trying so hard?

179
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,550
If you get caught running,
they will have your head.

180
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:09,219
Is he naive or just stupid?

181
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,263
Did you just talk badly about me?

182
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,310
No, I did not.

183
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,353
So help me. Help me.

184
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,605
Help me!

185
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,483
What did you say? I cannot hear you.

186
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,818
You...

187
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,576
Master!

188
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,412
Master! Please get me out.

189
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,289
- What?
- Please.

190
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,958
"Master, please."

191
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,211
Master, please.

192
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,483
What's going on?

193
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,985
Are you crying? Seriously?

194
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,820
Are you enjoying this right now?

195
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,326
Well, it is not so bad.

196
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,453
At least I am in Hanyang.

197
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,292
My gosh, I knew you would be
from the countryside.

198
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,628
Why did you come to Hanyang?
Are you here to see His Majesty?

199
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,048
No.

200
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,593
I came to find out...

201
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,637
who I really am.

202
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,601
What a joke.

203
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,021
I cannot believe this coward
tried to run away.

204
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,768
Oh, my gosh!

205
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,062
My goodness gracious.

206
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,522
My gosh.

207
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,899
What is wrong with you?

208
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,945
My gosh, that really startled me.

209
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,615
Follow me!

210
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,084
We should follow the law
and the mandatory procedure.

211
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,377
Are you sure this is okay?

212
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,714
We do not even know
when the arrow was shot.

213
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,340
This is such an unnecessary hassle.

214
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,858
How dare you!

215
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,923
Carry on with the interrogation.

216
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,300
Who are you? And where are you from?

217
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,932
We are doing this to keep a record,

218
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,183
so answer the question.

219
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,979
I am Kim Won Sik from Jidam Valley.

220
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,232
What were you doing at the market?

221
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:14,816
I was...

222
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,318
just passing by.

223
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,987
You came all the way to Hanyang
from Jidam Valley.

224
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,614
And you were just passing by?

225
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,492
Tell me what you were doing there
in detail.

226
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,038
If you lie, you will not be able
to walk out of here alive.

227
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,041
Stay alive, my baby.

228
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,793
You must...

229
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,588
You must stay alive.

230
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,009
Why can you not answer my question?

231
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,310
How dare you!

232
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,312
Answer the question!

233
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,447
My gosh.

234
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,797
Let me meet His Majesty.

235
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,435
This is really frustrating.

236
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,978
Let me meet him.

237
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,146
How dare you!

238
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:37,900
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

239
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,111
No, I do not want to die.

240
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,404
And even if I do die,

241
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,864
let me talk to him first.

242
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,408
What a complete lunatic.

243
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,160
Suppress him!

244
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,835
What are you so frustrated about?

245
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,338
If he really wanted to rebel
against His Majesty,

246
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,840
do you really think he would have
thrown a stone like that?

247
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,592
And the same goes for that arrow.

248
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,845
You do not even know
when and who shot it.

249
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,559
Everyone in the country
will be talking about this already.

250
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,269
You arrested hundreds
of innocent people...

251
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,771
just because of an old man
who lost his son and grandson...

252
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,814
due to the palace construction.

253
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,193
But is this really
the best way you can use us?

254
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,362
What? "Use"?

255
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,447
Yes, that is right.
If I were His Majesty,

256
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,533
I would lay grass on the grave
of the old man's son and grandson...

257
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,619
instead of doing something
so unnecessary like this.

258
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:34,414
I would show everyone
how magnanimous I am.

259
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,126
Is that what you were going to say
to His Majesty?

260
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,045
Yes.

261
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,798
I was going to tell him
that he should at least pretend.

262
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,633
Who knows?

263
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,884
People might get moved by that...

264
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,928
and put in their best effort
to build the palace.

265
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,015
What a shallow idea.

266
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,685
I will tell them to get rid of him.

267
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:55,853
No.

268
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,146
He does have a point.

269
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:01,650
It may be shallow,
but it does make sense.

270
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,529
He is saying
that the people of this country...

271
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,490
might start to like
their incompetent King.

272
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,118
- Then...
- Yes.

273
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,036
Let us pretend.

274
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,874
But do not spare the life
of the man who threw the stone.

275
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,251
Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,649
My gosh.

277
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,859
I know you are grateful.

278
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,777
So let me ask you for a favor.

279
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,155
What?

280
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,700
Do you like rice soup?

281
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,660
Do you have some money?

282
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,370
My gosh.

283
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,080
My goodness.

284
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,543
No!

285
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,641
You are very weak for a man.

286
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,476
How are you going to earn a living?

287
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:18,894
What did you just say?

288
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,647
You ruined everything
by getting in my way.

289
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,233
You talk big for someone who
just begged for a bowl of rice soup.

290
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,817
I did not beg you.

291
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,945
I gave you a chance to repay me.

292
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,696
Plus, if I had not helped you,

293
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,406
you would be in your grave by now.

294
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,336
My will!

295
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,712
What am I going to do?

296
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,006
My will.

297
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,884
I hope we never meet again.

298
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:54,096
If we ever do meet,
I promise I will teach you a lesson.

299
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,057
He has a very loud voice...

300
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,268
for a coward and a weakling.

301
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,357
But where am I
going to find this woman?

302
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:11,154
But then again, I am probably
not the only one looking for her.

303
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,994
My goodness, what is wrong with you?

304
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,745
Do not eat if you are broke.

305
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,706
Why do you always come here?

306
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,916
Please do not be like that.
Can I have some leftover rice?

307
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,460
I would rather leave it to rot.
I will never give you anything.

308
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,628
Get lost!

309
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,130
My gosh.

310
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,053
Give me a room.
I will stay the night here.

311
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,513
Do you have money?

312
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:38,307
Of course.

313
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,185
I am also going to eat dinner,
so I will pay you then.

314
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,061
Come inside.

315
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,615
(Inn)

316
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,994
Come already.

317
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,123
So I can end this
and go see my father and my brother.

318
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,054
Go inside.

319
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,022
Hwang Tae.

320
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,485
I made it clear that you should
stop Nok Du from getting on a boat.

321
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,778
Father.

322
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,197
I'm sorry.

323
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,698
Why not?

324
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,284
I am not allowed to learn
how to read or get on a boat.

325
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,162
I want to read books
and paddle the boat too.

326
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,580
Why can I not do those things?

327
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,165
You have not learned your lesson.

328
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,793
Will more beating
teach you a lesson?

329
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,251
Is anyone inside?

330
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,463
(Inn)

331
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,432
A customer left
without eating this meal.

332
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,558
Would you like to have it?

333
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,351
You did not have dinner.

334
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:49,605
Well, I was about to go to sleep.

335
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,399
Eat it.
I will give this to you for free.

336
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,361
For free?

337
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,782
Thank you. I will enjoy the food.

338
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,127
Hey, it is midnight now.

339
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,296
Where are you going?

340
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,757
Hey, what is wrong with him?
What is he doing?

341
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,425
Are you okay?

342
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,052
Help me.

343
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,472
Hey. Hey, you.

344
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,057
What...

345
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,020
He is dead.

346
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,857
Go and get the chief.

347
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,609
- I will take a look around here.
- I am on it.

348
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,752
You said you would pay me
five yang for this.

349
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,015
Sir, this way.

350
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:51,602
He is right here.

351
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,313
What? How...

352
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,024
- How...
- Hey, Chil Bong.

353
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,832
Fine. Let me follow you
and see who your leader is.

354
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,563
There it is.

355
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:20,274
You are all dead.

356
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,960
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

357
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,044
- Gosh.
- Look.

358
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,921
- Why is here?
- What is going on?

359
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,965
- How did he get in here?
- That's a man.

360
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,008
- What?
- He's a man.

361
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,176
This is odd.

362
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,469
- Why do I only see women here?
- My gosh.

363
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,847
- What is going on here?
- Look at him.

364
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,974
- Why is he here?
- Look.

365
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,517
- How did he get in here?
- Goodness.

366
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,609
Why are you doing this to me?

367
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,573
You must have a death wish.

368
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,533
No, you must have gotten
the wrong idea.

369
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,076
As if.

370
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,536
You must be here for a sly agenda...

371
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,205
because only widows
live in this village.

372
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,040
- Get him!
- No.

373
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,188
(Women Only, Village for Widows)

374
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,325
Darn it.

375
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:59,998
They banned men
from entering the place,

376
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,875
but there are assassins inside?

377
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,502
I should just destroy...

378
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,255
No.

379
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,049
I would be dead
even before I find their leader.

380
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,343
Are you sure this is the right way?

381
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,179
Yes, this is the only way...

382
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:15,597
to reach the village for widows.

383
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,932
How dare she?

384
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,058
The ceremony
is right around the corner.

385
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,351
How dare she run away?

386
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,937
Your men are following Sung, right?

387
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,231
They are searching every nook
and corner of the mountain.

388
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,983
It's highly likely
that we'll catch him there.

389
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,026
Even if we miss him,
he'll come here,

390
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,111
so do not worry.

391
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,207
Over there! There!

392
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:54,511
Please let me help you.

393
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,388
Please forgive me.

394
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,398
Are you all right?

395
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,112
No!

396
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,739
I am okay.

397
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,876
Who are you?

398
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,173
Dol Bok, are you all right?

399
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,175
- My lady.
- Dol Bok.

400
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,968
Goodness.

401
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,428
Are you okay, my lady?

402
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,395
I am sorry.

403
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,649
You saved me, but we did you wrong.

404
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,069
My apologies, Master.

405
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,613
I thought you were trying
to harm her.

406
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:55,822
Forget it.

407
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,408
You should not go
to the village for widows.

408
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,577
Your father-in-law is waiting there.

409
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,624
Were you really planning...

410
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,460
to go there?

411
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:13,090
Do you not know that you will
never see me again if you go there?

412
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:15,300
I would rather
not see you forever...

413
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:16,969
than see you get hurt.

414
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:20,514
Why do you not understand me?

415
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:24,601
No. I will not let you go.

416
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,437
Well...

417
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,940
I do think there is a way.

418
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,661
Why are they not coming?

419
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,080
I hope they did not go
somewhere else.

420
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:46,665
My lord, over there!

421
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,508
You wench!

422
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,138
You should think you're honored
to sacrifice your life...

423
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,473
for your family.
How dare you run away?

424
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,102
You will not be able to meet
a peaceful death anymore.

425
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,606
Oh, my!

426
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:14,401
How dare you?

427
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,115
What is this?

428
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,575
Isn't this...

429
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,952
How dare you hit your father-in-law?

430
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,264
Who are you?

431
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:46,975
This is not my daughter-in-law.

432
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,188
Do forgive me.

433
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,374
She is lovely.

434
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,211
She is, indeed.

435
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,047
Especially from the back.

436
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:34,022
Goodness. Look at you.

437
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:36,483
I think we made a mistake.

438
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,152
- I will find another way...
- Not at all.

439
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:41,113
You look very beautiful.

440
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,366
You just need to fix
your gait and voice.

441
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,077
Right, your gait is a bit...

442
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:51,707
This is not much,
but I would like to thank you.

443
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,792
That was not necessary.

444
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,510
Wait, I was not expecting anything
in return for helping you.

445
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:06,388
Have I inconvenienced you
once again?

446
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,514
Then...

447
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:10,100
However, I was taught that
refusing a lady's hospitality...

448
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,477
was not something
a man ought to do.

449
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,479
That is true.

450
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:25,073
All right. Let us go.

451
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,722
Goodness, that is pretty.

452
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,600
- Look at this.
- It looks nice.

453
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,019
Thank you.

454
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:55,145
Who are you?

455
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,942
Well... I...

456
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,444
I am a member of the Kim family
from Hanyang.

457
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,113
I heard that you helped widows
who were on the run.

458
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:06,698
Is that so?

459
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,283
Come on in.

460
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,913
Come this way.

461
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,543
This village was formed
during the Japanese invasion.

462
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,712
Widows who lost their husbands
in the war...

463
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:24,091
came here in groups
and started living here.

464
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,927
They told us to kill ourselves...

465
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,429
to preserve our families' honor.

466
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,431
They talked such nonsense.

467
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:32,683
But for whose benefit?

468
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,227
After living here for some time,

469
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,603
this place has turned
into a nice village...

470
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:38,230
that even His Majesty approved of.

471
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,439
Do you not think so?

472
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:40,983
You're right.

473
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,068
- Goodness.
- I'm dying here.

474
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,528
Do not worry.

475
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,114
Other than the entranceway
you entered from...

476
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,074
and the way to the gisaeng house
over there,

477
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,201
there are no other routes
to this place.

478
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:57,124
Are all these
ordinary-looking women...

479
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,084
in one team?

480
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:07,009
My goodness.
You have quite a build.

481
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,052
You are the best wife material.

482
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:12,890
My mother's side of the family
is known for their height.

483
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,433
I took after her.

484
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:16,643
- Yes.
- I see.

485
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:20,230
There you are.

486
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,232
Hi.

487
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,277
We have a new widow.

488
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,487
She was chased all the way here
from Hanyang.

489
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:30,949
- Goodness.
- What?

490
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,367
Hello.

491
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:38,123
Do not be alarmed.

492
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,125
At times, there are
some brazen men...

493
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,127
who try to sneak their way in.

494
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,379
But we, the Virtuous Women Corps,

495
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,048
catch every single one of them...

496
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,674
and send them on their way
to the netherworld.

497
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,176
- We always do.
- We always do.

498
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,471
- I see.
- Leave those men up to us.

499
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,183
Lady Chun!

500
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,189
She is a new widow.

501
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,941
She is the head
of the gisaeng house.

502
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,192
Hello.

503
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:10,072
Why is there a gisaeng house
next to the village for widows?

504
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,407
The female energy is strong here,

505
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,826
so we thought it was
an ideal place for a gisaeng house.

506
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,870
And now, the widows...

507
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,206
make alcohol and sew clothes
for the gisaeng house.

508
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,459
And Lady Chun takes care
of our village as well.

509
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:25,212
We are helping each other out.

510
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,674
Welcome.

511
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,385
She must be tired.
Report this to the Vice-Curator...

512
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,845
and let her rest.

513
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:36,139
But we do not have
a vacant place for her.

514
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,767
It will take some time
to build a place for her.

515
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:42,229
How about letting her stay
at your place for the time being?

516
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:44,565
Sun Nyeo, since you sleep alone,
how about you take her?

517
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:47,025
- Sure, that sounds good.
- That works.

518
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:48,193
No!

519
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:53,323
Well... So... What I mean is...

520
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,409
I refused because...

521
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,120
I feel utterly terrible...

522
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,081
to inconvenience you.

523
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,165
Come on, now!

524
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,501
It does not matter.
We are both women.

525
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:05,586
No!

526
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,963
I cannot bear such a burden.

527
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,340
Did you not say the gisaeng house
was next to the village?

528
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:13,427
May I sleep there?

529
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:14,887
What?

530
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,222
At our gisaeng house?

531
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:27,274
Will you be all right?

532
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:29,776
There will be many men.

533
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,986
It will be uncomfortable.

534
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:34,072
I am fine. It will only be
for a few days. I will be okay.

535
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:36,283
All right. How about...

536
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,994
you share Dong Joo's room?

537
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:41,997
She has terrible sleeping habits
but is quite a nice...

538
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,624
Stop crying.

539
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,292
This is so good.

540
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,170
- Come out!
- It hurts!

541
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,005
It hurts!

542
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:51,632
Come here!

543
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:54,134
My lord.

544
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:55,594
- Please do not do this.
- Come here!

545
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:56,678
No.

546
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,016
Let her go.

547
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:02,976
Dong Joo, stop.

548
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,270
You must want to die, do you not?

549
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:06,355
My lord!

550
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,401
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

551
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,907
My lord, what brings you here?

552
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,535
I offered to give that girl
a chance to become a true gisaeng.

553
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,037
But that lowly wench
dared to refuse.

554
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,541
Look at this mess!

555
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:30,671
She is not an official gisaeng,

556
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,340
and she is merely 12 years old.

557
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,093
Bring Cho Sun to the main building.

558
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:39,054
My lord, for now...

559
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:40,222
What did you say?

560
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,432
You must be
out of your mind as well.

561
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,977
You will not take her away!

562
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,061
My lord.

563
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:50,065
Do you not know that
this is against the customs?

564
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:51,733
"Customs"?

565
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:53,735
"Customs"?

566
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,117
I cannot believe you lowly wenches
are talking about customs.

567
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,577
You are right.

568
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:06,123
What use is there for lowly women
like us to mention customs?

569
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,416
However,

570
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,668
it is a different story for you.

571
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,379
I only said that
because I was worried...

572
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:15,257
that someone so high
and significant like you...

573
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,593
might lose your dignity
because of a fleeting emotion.

574
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,471
Then how long
do you expect me to wait?

575
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:25,642
You will have to wait
for another 3 to 4 years.

576
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:27,311
All right.

577
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,688
I will wait.

578
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:38,155
Oh, my gosh.

579
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,200
My lord.

580
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,289
Will this do?

581
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:50,083
My lord, what are you doing?

582
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,793
It will take about 3 to 4 years...

583
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:53,837
for this much of her hair
to grow back.

584
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,464
- My lord!
- Why?

585
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,132
I do not want her...

586
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,134
to get snatched away
by another man...

587
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,677
while I wait for her.

588
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,640
Or...

589
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:08,101
will you sacrifice
your hair instead?

590
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,777
What do you think you are doing?

591
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,367
If the hair is what you want,
I will give it to you.

592
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:25,327
Hair always grows back.

593
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,829
It cannot be more important
than that little girl.

594
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,543
- My gosh.
- Oh no.

595
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:47,784
What an arrogant brat.

596
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:50,787
Do you really want to die?

597
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,414
Hurry up and teach her a lesson!

598
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:54,958
- You little...
- Is anyone inside?

599
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,877
- My lord.
- My lord.

600
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,086
Byeon Hong. Ok Ran. Hello.

601
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,213
- My lord.
- My lord.

602
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:01,131
Yes, what is it?

603
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:02,799
Everything will be fine.

604
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,523
Who are you?

605
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,108
I am sorry about that.

606
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:21,610
Are you okay?

607
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,197
Are you a caterer?

608
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,157
Let us say I am.

609
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:30,869
You must be very upset
because of what happened.

610
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,913
I am glad you understand.

611
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,541
Look at what these witches
have done to me.

612
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:39,378
These darn witches
dared to cross an aristocrat!

613
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:40,629
Here.

614
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:42,297
Try it.

615
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:44,508
What is this?

616
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,260
Chew it well.

617
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:48,387
That will help you...

618
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,055
calm your anger.

619
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:55,185
My gosh, this is so bitter!

620
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:57,896
Whatever tastes bitter
is good for your health.

621
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:00,232
What do you say?
Would you like another?

622
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,234
- Water! Water!
- Where is the water?

623
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:04,069
Where is the water?

624
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:05,946
- Give me water!
- Here you go.

625
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:07,698
- Drink up.
- My lord, drink some water.

626
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:13,078
My goodness!

627
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:17,249
Oh, gosh.

628
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,334
I thought it was water.

629
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:20,669
But it was vinegar.

630
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,046
This is bad.

631
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,007
If you eat vinegar
with what I just gave you,

632
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,466
it will turn into poison.

633
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,928
My lord, get on my back.

634
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:31,972
Out of the way! Move!

635
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,724
- My goodness!
- My lord!

636
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,434
My lord, hang in there.

637
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,732
Does it really turn into poison?

638
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,942
I do not know.
I have never had it before.

639
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:47,613
My lord, come inside.

640
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:51,533
Let us stop the fuss.
Now, get back inside.

641
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,869
- Okay, ma'am.
- Okay, ma'am.

642
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,998
I am sorry you had to see that.

643
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,584
- Your room is at the very end.
- Okay.

644
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:02,044
I can find it on my own.

645
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,922
Look at this.

646
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,132
It's okay.

647
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,260
Follow me inside.

648
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:13,222
Oh, dear.

649
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,194
She really looks familiar.

650
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,196
I wonder where I saw her.

651
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:31,615
My goodness.

652
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,808
Well, I am finally here.

653
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:01,186
But she obviously will not tell me
who gave the orders.

654
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,856
How am I going to find out?

655
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:20,414
Why would you do
something like that?

656
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:24,209
Mae Hyang was only 13 years old
when he took her.

657
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:27,296
But she came back dead,
and that only happened a month ago.

658
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:29,965
How could I let him do that again?

659
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,967
So you cut your hair?
You are a gisaeng!

660
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,678
I could not let him cut your hair!

661
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:37,681
I am not even
an official gisaeng yet.

662
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,559
Are you proud
that you are still a trainee?

663
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,062
Look at yourself.

664
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,647
He made me get so angry.

665
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,108
How could he mistreat us like that?

666
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,903
Who does he think he is?
That ugly little jerk.

667
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:52,154
My goodness.

668
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:54,406
My gosh.

669
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:00,245
I will leave you to rest.

670
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,667
I heard you recently went outside.

671
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:08,629
Where did you go?

672
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,344
Do not get yourself in trouble.

673
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,637
Do you understand?

674
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:19,348
Okay.

675
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:35,197
Why did you do that?

676
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,949
I got really angry.

677
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:39,117
That ugly little jerk...

678
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,702
caused a ruckus
at the gisaeng house.

679
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:42,371
I really adore this place.

680
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:44,164
Do not get involved again.

681
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:46,333
I cannot guarantee that.

682
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,335
You left behind a will
and disappeared.

683
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,128
How could I not get involved?

684
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:52,464
I almost had a heart attack.

685
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,132
How could you leave this
and just disappear?

686
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,009
Did you not care
how worried I would be?

687
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:57,553
Did you forget our promise?
You promised...

688
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:59,137
that you would not meddle
in my life.

689
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,433
Am I also not allowed to worry?

690
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,936
If you keep doing this,
I will just leave this place.

691
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:08,814
Okay, fine. I will stop.

692
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:11,608
You really have a way
of shutting my mouth.

693
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,821
See you, then.

694
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:28,458
My gosh, what is wrong with you?

695
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,544
Let me check if she took anything.

696
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:33,463
Give me that.

697
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:34,631
Don't touch me!

698
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,842
- Just give me that!
- My gosh, what are you doing?

699
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:38,677
My goodness.

700
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:45,225
I am sorry.

701
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:47,477
Why did you go through my stuff?

702
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,812
You...

703
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,026
You are the one who groped my top.

704
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:56,570
You touched my stuff
without permission.

705
00:53:57,196 --> 00:53:59,698
Did you see what was inside?

706
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:01,658
No.

707
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,749
But wait a minute.
What are you doing in this room?

708
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:11,001
Lady Chun told me
that I could stay here.

709
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:14,296
My gosh, I hate sharing rooms
with someone.

710
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:19,051
Does she think I am happy
that I have to share rooms with her?

711
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:21,553
But then again, I am the only one
who sleeps alone.

712
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:23,096
So I guess
she did not have a choice.

713
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,476
You are free
to make yourself at home.

714
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:29,144
But if you touch my stuff...

715
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:31,188
I will not touch anything.

716
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,023
I will not touch a single thing
that belongs to you!

717
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:01,552
What?

718
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,058
Hey.

719
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:11,144
I lost him because of you.

720
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:16,483
I guess you are also
quite the unusual kind.

721
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,698
I am not following you.

722
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:24,867
Okay.

723
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:28,954
"This beautiful flower..."

724
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:31,081
"soothes my loneliness."

725
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,792
My lord.

726
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:35,794
What are you doing here?

727
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:39,840
"However, I dare say many feelings
of my loneliness were blissful..."

728
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:43,343
"now that I have had the honor
of witnessing the beauty of Korea."

729
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:46,555
You must have meant to say,
"beauty enough to cause a downfall."

730
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,271
Well, are you teasing me
because my hair looks different now?

731
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:02,654
I knew at first sight
that you were the woman...

732
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,156
I have been looking for.

733
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:06,158
What...

734
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:08,160
What? Me?

735
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,830
What about her?

736
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:18,337
I will leave you to it.

737
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,005
- No.
- Okay.

738
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,423
- I believe you are the new widow...
- I cannot believe this.

739
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,966
who just arrived here today.

740
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,802
- I am not interested.
- Goodness.

741
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:28,972
I used to have a very
important position in Hanyang.

742
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:31,642
To comply with the royal command
from His Majesty,

743
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,435
I have come to this village
as its supervisor.

744
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,104
My position is of Class Nine.
I am a vice-curator. My name is...

745
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:40,817
- Yeon Geun.
- That is one useless position.

746
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,069
Wait.

747
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:44,905
I am going to touch your hand now.

748
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,241
I cannot go inside,

749
00:56:47,324 --> 00:56:49,826
but I am in charge of everything
that goes on in the village.

750
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,703
- Please let me know whenever...
- I do not want this.

751
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,585
So you're in charge of the village?

752
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:05,342
Thank you.

753
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:07,970
This will help me befriend
a lot of widows here.

754
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:10,055
I would like to be
a very good friend too.

755
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,688
Lady, there is no need to feel shy.

756
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:48,385
Even if you get back at them,
that will not lead you anywhere.

757
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,511
So...

758
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:52,514
you should follow the assassin
and find the leader.

759
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,106
I found her.

760
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:02,816
I found you.

761
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:17,039
We have been looking
all over for you,

762
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,916
so we could have
an honest conversation.

763
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,168
I am not much of a talker.
I would like to decline.

764
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,045
I bet it must be tough.

765
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:25,130
Come with us.

766
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:26,632
Go where?

767
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,592
Taking a bath together
is the best way...

768
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,010
to be friends.

769
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,971
"Taking a bath"? That is ridiculous.

770
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:35,974
How could women bathe together?

771
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,689
I am very shy.

772
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,694
- We were shy at first too.
- That's right.

773
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,906
My goodness,
we're all here together.

774
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:53,116
- Let us go.
- Let us go.

775
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,118
- I am very shy.
- Wait up.

776
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,578
- You are loving it.
- Just join us.

777
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:57,579
I told you I did not want to bathe.

778
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:58,997
- Come on.
- I am very shy.

779
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:01,333
- We are neighbors, are we not?
- Goodness.

780
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,043
Hey, hey.

781
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:04,211
I have been looking for you.

782
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,754
You and I...

783
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,590
were supposed
to go to that place together.

784
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:10,300
Together...

785
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:13,011
Where were you planning to go?

786
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:13,971
Pardon?

787
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,181
I have been feeling itchy
because of my hair.

788
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,141
So I was going to take a bath.

789
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:27,401
- Come on. All right.
- Oh, no.

790
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,111
Let us get going.

791
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,155
No, no! I cannot do this!

792
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,032
- Let us bathe!
- No!

793
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,784
I cannot!

794
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:37,786
Please put me down.

795
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:41,707
Homage to the Amitabha Buddha,
homage to the Amitabha Buddha.

796
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:45,085
I think I should get going.

797
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:46,962
Goodness!

798
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,047
I cannot...

799
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,929
I think it is better for me
to skip this one.

800
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:57,222
How come?

801
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:59,099
Well...

802
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:01,977
Actually, I have a skin disease.

803
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,855
This water is medicinal.

804
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:06,523
It will cure your disease.

805
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:08,650
Please go into the water.

806
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:12,905
Well, the thing is...

807
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,032
I drowned once when I was young.
I have bad memories of water.

808
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:17,576
Only weak people
avoid their problems.

809
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,078
Face your fear and overcome it.

810
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:22,080
Goodness.

811
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:25,209
Come join us in the water.
The water is clean here.

812
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,085
No, that is not what I meant.

813
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:32,633
Gosh, you are way too shy.
All of us are women here.

814
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,136
No, no.

815
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,103
I cannot...

816
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:46,855
Oh, no! It's cold.

817
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:01,328
Isn't that refreshing?

818
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,121
I knew you would come in.

819
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:05,582
Hey.

820
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,315
That little...

821
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,414
(We thank Lee Ho Jae, Park Chul Min,
and Jung Yi Rang...)

822
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:47,416
(for their guest appearances.)

823
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:02,347
(The Tale of Nokdu)

824
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:04,057
So hear me out.

825
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,560
"Really?" "No way."

826
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,270
It's something
you cannot say it yourself.

827
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:11,356
You must have something
you want other people to talk about.

828
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,150
Are you Jung Yun Jeo?

829
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,152
I am certain
that it was Jung Yun Jeo.

830
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:17,070
Do you remember the day
when Yun Jeo died?

831
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:19,156
He died
after he had buried the baby.

832
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,158
