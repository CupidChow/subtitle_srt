(Episode 21)

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,161
Gosh.

7
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,374
Darn it.

8
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,545
- What is it?
- What?

9
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,715
What?

10
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,675
You cannot look me in the eye.

11
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,302
You seem anxious.

12
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,387
Gosh.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,182
I am nervous.

14
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,059
Now?

15
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,353
Yes, I am.

16
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,981
I do not know why I am nervous now.

17
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,151
This is odd.
I am acting weird, right?

18
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,987
You are such a coward.

19
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,366
And you do not feel nervous at all?

20
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,327
I feel...

21
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,456
as if my heart is about to...

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,083
I am completely fine.

23
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
Really?

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,963
Yes.

25
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,813
Dong Joo.

26
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,278
We deserve death, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,197
We did not know...

28
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,533
that it was a grave crime.

29
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,493
When you were burying
the dead bodies,

30
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,580
did you see Yu Yeon Kyung
and the family's bodies?

31
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,504
I think I might have seen the lady
we used to serve.

32
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,757
- Well...
- They were all dead.

33
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,968
All of them were dead.

34
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,428
The lady who ran away
from her house...

35
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,099
and even her daughter were dead.

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,059
After checking
that all of them were dead,

37
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,770
we buried all of their bodies.

38
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,815
Is that so?

39
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,943
Fine. Where did you bury...

40
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,444
their bodies?

41
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,919
I visited the gisaeng house
where Hwa Su is staying.

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,590
She did not go
to that gisaeng house either.

43
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,593
- I will search outside the city...
- That is enough. Take a seat.

44
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,095
Pardon?

45
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,431
Seeing how you were not able
to find her after much effort,

46
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,725
she must really hate me.

47
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,146
Should I be relieved
that she did not go to him?

48
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,403
We cannot go in like this.
What if someone sees us?

49
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,947
Did you not hear that you
should take absolute rest?

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,574
No one is at home, anyway.

51
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,701
Who would be in the yard
this early in the morning?

52
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,953
Hey, that is all right.
Just put me down.

53
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,538
- Come on.
- Put me down.

54
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,748
Come on.

55
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,626
See? I told you. No one is...

56
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,212
What?

57
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,755
- Goodness.
- I was wrong.

58
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,715
- Darn it.
- Hey.

59
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,800
Hey, it is Dong Joo.

60
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:22,763
Okay.

61
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,889
You know what?

62
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,016
He came to find you.

63
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,309
He is from the palace.

64
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,852
From the palace?

65
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,943
I do not mind having
one more servant under me.

66
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,486
May I ask why?

67
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,363
Why I am asking for such a favor?

68
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,034
She is the girl who gave advice
on how to treat...

69
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,746
His Majesty's insomnia
which even physicians gave up on.

70
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,208
Please accept my request.

71
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,253
Yes, Your Highness.

72
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,067
We are alive and together now.

73
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,986
So...

74
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,197
can you not follow your heart
and just like me?

75
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,491
I just...

76
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,535
like...

77
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,205
I really...

78
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,541
like you.

79
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,555
Did you ask to see me?

80
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,557
I need you to do a task for me.

81
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,018
I will spare you a few royal guards.

82
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,730
Okay. What is my task?

83
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,550
Bring them in.

84
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,798
I do not think
they remember the spot.

85
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,843
We cannot search
the entire mountain as it is vast.

86
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,269
There was a rule...

87
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,480
that we were not allowed to come out
when we heard a bell rattling.

88
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,567
And meanwhile,

89
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,527
Lord Heo often visited
an isolated house...

90
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,112
in the village for widows.

91
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,530
An isolated house?

92
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,200
You just said you could not go out.

93
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,410
How would you know that?

94
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,203
Just because my friend saw...

95
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,997
what she was not supposed
to witness at the house,

96
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,625
Lord Heo murdered her.

97
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,961
Hey. What are you talking about?

98
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,505
Tell His Majesty what the dead widow
saw at the house.

99
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,716
She told me
that there was a young man.

100
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,636
She said that he was
to do great things later on.

101
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,015
- Who is that man?
- Your Majesty.

102
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,143
There is something I must tell you
about that man, Your Majesty.

103
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,105
The man over there
has something to tell you.

104
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,612
Everyone else except these two
may leave.

105
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,199
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

106
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,661
- Goodness.
- Since you cannot seem to remember,

107
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,121
we shall return for today.

108
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,331
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

109
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,463
Whose burial ground...

110
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,590
are you looking for?

111
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,674
Sorry?

112
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,888
It is...

113
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,016
Lord Yu Yeon Kyung's tomb.

114
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,144
He was killed for plotting treason
against His Majesty.

115
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,438
We did not know...

116
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,899
that burying him
was such a grave sin.

117
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,318
We have no idea...

118
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,113
where we buried him.

119
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,657
Then why did His Majesty...

120
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,117
want us to dig it up?

121
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,119
You see,

122
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,871
they have died.

123
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,249
They have all died,

124
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,417
but he does not believe that.

125
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,630
The girl died as well.

126
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,590
I am telling you the truth.

127
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,468
All right. You may leave.

128
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,220
Let us go.

129
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,431
Let us go.

130
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,601
It was your son...

131
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,772
whom the chancellor
had hidden at that place.

132
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,567
That is why he had to get rid
of all evidence...

133
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,360
through killing
and burning the document.

134
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,112
No, Your Majesty.

135
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,198
Everything he is saying is a lie.

136
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,244
When we lived on that island,
my brother once said...

137
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,538
that he wanted to rise...

138
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,416
to the highest position.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,626
- What?
- Your Majesty.

140
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,714
Back then, I thought
he wanted to become a general.

141
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,465
The chancellor did not want
Prince Yeongchang on the throne.

142
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,134
He wanted your son on the throne.

143
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,136
Enough. Enough!

144
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,639
Do you not know how hard
it was to get rid of him?

145
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,225
So how could you spare him...

146
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,729
and attempt to put him
on the throne in my stead?

147
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,815
How dare you? How could you?

148
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,985
What are you so afraid of?

149
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,946
I believed...

150
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,991
that you no longer belonged
in that position.

151
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:16,992
How dare you?

152
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,702
A king...

153
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,581
should not kill his subjects
or his own offspring.

154
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,126
Do you not know that the king
should be just in his ruling...

155
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:30,339
and protect his people?

156
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,716
Shut your mouth!

157
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,885
You abandoned your people,

158
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,429
your long-time friend,

159
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,183
and even your own baby.

160
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,518
How dare you?

161
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,145
What are you so afraid of...

162
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,498
I told you to be quiet.

163
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,710
Your Majesty...

164
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,641
What... What have I done?

165
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,647
No. No. No!

166
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:39,157
(20 years ago
during the Japanese invasion)

167
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,088
I was taught that you should be
responsible for your decisions.

168
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,676
But where are the ones
who must take responsibility now?

169
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,470
Why do the people
who have no power to choose...

170
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,889
their country or their king...

171
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,184
have to meet such wrongful deaths?

172
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,935
Your Highness...

173
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,875
I will be different.

174
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,045
Even though they have no choice,

175
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,007
I will make sure they are happy
to be my people.

176
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,345
I will bring forth such a world.

177
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,988
I have always admired
the tears you had shed...

178
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,576
to this day.

179
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:08,997
Yun.

180
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,584
I wanted to stay by your side...

181
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,880
and make your wish come true...

182
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,468
Do not talk anymore.

183
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,763
Call a physician!
Call him this instant!

184
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,139
No.

185
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,767
You may not die. No!

186
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,611
No. No.

187
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,281
Yun! Yun!

188
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,242
No! Yun!

189
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,452
No!

190
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,080
Yun...

191
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,165
Yun...

192
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,419
Yun...

193
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,022
What will you do?

194
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,733
I must see the Queen.

195
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,943
How will you do that?

196
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,362
You should meet your son and...

197
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,739
He must...

198
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,783
never find out the truth.

199
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:31,288
The Queen is the only one
who can protect him until the end.

200
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,626
I will look for a way.

201
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,920
No. I will find it myself.

202
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,296
You may leave.

203
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,340
I was told to protect you
until the end...

204
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,050
by Lord Heo.

205
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,307
My lord.

206
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,479
Are you injured?

207
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,856
I am okay.

208
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,275
Did you find the burial ground?

209
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,819
They could not remember
the location.

210
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,029
It was such a long time ago.

211
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,697
They may leave.

212
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,700
We do not need to find it anymore.

213
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,452
What do you mean?

214
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,037
So...

215
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,628
Send them away first.
I must wash up.

216
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,263
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

217
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,515
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,226
I am sure it was
His Majesty's order.

219
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,227
So...

220
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,480
I am forever grateful.

221
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,042
Right. I am sorry.

222
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,003
Let us go.

223
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:05,257
Yes, my lord. Thank you.

224
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,854
How could you already start working
when you are still unwell?

225
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,274
Did you have to start today?

226
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,404
Forget it. I will do it.

227
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,907
Sit down and rest.

228
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,909
Or stand there and watch me.

229
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:33,952
Gosh.

230
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,289
By the way, why are you here?

231
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,874
I came to see you.

232
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,709
I am going to snatch you away
once you leave the palace.

233
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,295
And what will you do after that?

234
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,051
Gosh, you have not planned yet.

235
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,135
Well...

236
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,970
There are just too many.

237
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,640
I have not yet made up my mind.

238
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,269
Shall we ride the swing?

239
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,813
Okay, let us do that.

240
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,107
And for tomorrow...

241
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,109
Do you know that a ssireum match
will be held at the marketplace?

242
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,819
Let us go watch that.

243
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,613
And the day after that...

244
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,907
Well...

245
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,621
What is it?

246
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,457
It is nothing.

247
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,963
All right. Let us do everything
that we can.

248
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,009
Okay. I will be waiting
at the back door.

249
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,721
Hurry up and go.
Someone might see you.

250
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:35,931
Okay.

251
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,602
Bye.

252
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,485
There.

253
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,406
What is this?

254
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,159
"I picked it up on my way here."

255
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,662
That was what
Master Hwang told me to say.

256
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,707
But it was pretty,
so I got it for you.

257
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,558
Bye.

258
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,019
Go.

259
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:49,982
Bye.

260
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,609
Chief Administrative Officer Yeon.

261
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,673
Why do you look at me that way?

262
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,177
Come to think of it,

263
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,222
you have never looked peaceful...

264
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,726
from the moment I first met you
up until today.

265
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,399
Do you know
that I felt the most peaceful...

266
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,861
when I sneaked outside...

267
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:22,032
and met you?

268
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,415
Did you hear...

269
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,252
about what I have done today?

270
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:37,673
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,425
All right. I see.

272
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,096
Is it because of that man
I and Lord Baek are chasing after?

273
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,640
- Is it because Lord Heo hid him...
- No.

274
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,892
It is all my fault.

275
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:50,727
Everything is my fault.

276
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,689
Ever since that day.

277
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,527
Everything has turned awry...

278
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,113
since that day.

279
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,491
If you are aware of that,

280
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,036
then there must be a solution.

281
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,964
I frequently have nightmares...

282
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,842
of that night.

283
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,180
It is scary and frightening.

284
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,519
But do you know
what I am the most afraid of?

285
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,065
It is that if I were to go back,

286
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,401
I would...

287
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:45,532
not have the courage
to make a different choice.

288
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,078
Your Majesty.

289
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,042
Do you remember...

290
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,420
Your Majesty.

291
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,728
Am I...

292
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,024
a part...

293
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,611
of that dreadful night?

294
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,222
Open the door! Open this!

295
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,390
Open!

296
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,724
Is anyone there?

297
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,020
The skies desire a new king.

298
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,406
Repeat what you have just said.

299
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:11,910
Your son who will be born
on November 19...

300
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,913
will become the next king.

301
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:17,791
What did you say?

302
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,419
How does that make sense?

303
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,296
Look at me.

304
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,840
I am sweeping the battlefields...

305
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,800
in my father's place.

306
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,844
I am still alive and well.

307
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,095
And yet,

308
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,764
the next king will be born
in a few days?

309
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,520
Right.

310
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,981
That was what
my father had wanted as well.

311
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,149
If it was not for the war,

312
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,985
I would not have become
the Crown Prince.

313
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,655
However, I am now the Crown Prince.

314
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,283
I have finally become
the Crown Prince!

315
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:55,329
So enough with what the skies want
and tell me.

316
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,581
What should I do?

317
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,374
What do I need to do?

318
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,879
You can neither change...

319
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,009
nor prevent what the skies desire,

320
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,552
Your Highness.

321
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,388
Do you know the gravity...

322
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,642
of what you have just said?

323
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,395
I cannot lie
about what the skies want...

324
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,692
just because I am afraid...

325
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,695
of losing my life.

326
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:32,199
I will change that fate.

327
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,284
I will prevent it from happening.

328
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,578
I will make sure...

329
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,415
that I become the king!

330
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,484
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

331
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,069
I will call the physician.

332
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,988
Or should I call the head eunuch?

333
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,792
Why...

334
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,962
are you crying?

335
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,552
No, Your Majesty.

336
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,888
I was not crying.

337
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,396
Your Highness.

338
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,108
This is your child.

339
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,655
This is your son.

340
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,789
I truly wish...

341
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,087
that you will never find out...

342
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,174
what kind of person I am.

343
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,044
I am sure all of you have heard
about what happened to Lord Heo.

344
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,254
Yes.

345
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:35,340
We owe it to you
to have handled the situation.

346
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,010
Had you not done it, all of us
would have been affected...

347
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,720
and faced an ordeal.

348
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,391
The revolt will take place
on the 15th of the next month.

349
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,935
When His Majesty leaves Hanyang
to pay his respect...

350
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,896
at the royal ancestral site,
I will take over the empty palace.

351
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,191
At 11pm, I will head to the palace
with the guards from Changui Gate.

352
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,483
Make sure the gate is open.

353
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,986
Yes. I will make sure it is open.

354
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,279
You are to take the royal seal,

355
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,615
capture the King,
and come back to the palace.

356
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,283
Deputy Chief, once you escort
the Queen Dowager...

357
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,701
and she gives you her order,

358
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,453
the revolt will end smoothly.

359
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,539
Yes. He kicked his younger brother
out and drove him to death.

360
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,875
And he has committed a grave crime
of imprisoning his mother.

361
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,668
I doubt that people will oppose.

362
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,962
Our cause is more than justified.

363
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,215
However, we may be able
to add one more to the list.

364
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,718
I know His Majesty's secret
which is more hideous...

365
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,679
and depraved
than what you have listed.

366
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,225
This is all
Grand Prince Neungyang's doing?

367
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,353
He was the one
who burned down our village.

368
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:30,729
As for Lady Chun's death...

369
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,106
Well, it is not like
we have evidence.

370
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,650
But seeing how he tried
to bring down Lord Heo...

371
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,693
by making you lie...

372
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,738
Oh, no.

373
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:44,201
Then, Lord Heo died
all because of us.

374
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,370
I should just kill
Grand Prince Neungyang.

375
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,580
If you make rash decisions because
you are emotionally worked up,

376
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,082
everything will come to nothing.

377
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,000
The three of us...

378
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,253
cannot defeat Dan Ho.

379
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,382
Until we find a way
to take him down, lie low.

380
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,591
I will contact you.

381
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:18,735
Dong Joo.

382
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,158
- Nok Du.
- Hey.

383
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,547
You caused it. Why did you do that?

384
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,215
You startled me.

385
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,677
I just wanted to see you surprised.
Are you happy now?

386
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:46,638
Goodness.

387
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,182
Is it not a surprise...

388
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,600
how handsome I look
even when I am injured?

389
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,059
Right?

390
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,270
Yes.

391
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,150
You are very handsome.

392
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,194
But you are pretty at the same time.

393
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,738
When you pretended to be a widow,

394
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,406
you were prettier than a woman.

395
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,702
Why are you being so nice to me?

396
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,289
You cannot even handle
a compliment from me.

397
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,208
Why do you always brag?

398
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,335
Come quickly.
We have a lot of things to do.

399
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,815
This is the prettiest.

400
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,651
What?

401
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,153
This one.

402
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,572
What was that? Come on.

403
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,241
She does not know how pretty she is.

404
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,659
How much is it?

405
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,328
All right. Buy some fireworks.

406
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,164
I brought these
straight from the Ming Empire.

407
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,123
Here.

408
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,297
Hey, we should buy everything
in the basket.

409
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,133
Give us everything
including the basket.

410
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:06,677
- The basket too?
- Yes.

411
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,345
- I see.
- I would like okchundang too.

412
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:09,721
Sure.

413
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,017
Open it.

414
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,146
Here you go.

415
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:23,026
You were really cute
when you ate okchundang before.

416
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,152
You look like a rabbit.

417
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,406
Buy me shoes.

418
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,742
- No.
- Why not?

419
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:33,912
I said, no.

420
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:35,163
Why not? They are pretty.

421
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,165
Buy me a pair of shoes. Please?

422
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,085
If I buy you shoes, you will
run away again, will you not?

423
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,086
I cannot.

424
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,588
I will not run away.

425
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,798
Come on. Just buy me a pair.

426
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,885
I will buy you everything
except for the shoes.

427
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:49,803
Just not the shoes.

428
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,098
Hey, I can make that myself.

429
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,100
That is really pretty.

430
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:57,186
If you can make it yourself,
why would we buy it?

431
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,479
- Be quiet. They will hear us.
- Come to think of it,

432
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,024
I spent more money than you did.

433
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:04,902
They are...

434
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:07,654
a well-matched couple.

435
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:08,739
Darn it.

436
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,618
Goodness. What is this heavy push?

437
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,829
Wait. You are...

438
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:18,290
Vice-Curator.

439
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,168
What do you think?
I can make a gown for you.

440
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,629
I have dexterous hands.

441
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:26,048
Hey. She is from our village.

442
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:32,221
Lady Park.

443
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,973
Hey.

444
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,978
- Lady Kang.
- Lady Kim.

445
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,149
- What a small world.
- My gosh.

446
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,737
This is all I have for now.
Please have some.

447
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,657
Gosh.

448
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:57,120
We have the lotus root
for the side dish.

449
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,789
It sounds just like
the vice-curator's name.

450
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,000
My goodness. You are quite playful.

451
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,837
I am being playful, right?

452
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,012
It must have been hard for you.

453
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,849
You were in the well for two days.

454
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,892
It is all right.

455
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,228
It must have been hard for you too.

456
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:23,272
Do not even get me started.

457
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,150
Two days?

458
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:30,279
You did not eat for two days?

459
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,115
Two days?

460
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,869
Yes. That is why I am starving.

461
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,248
- Here is your rice.
- What?

462
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:42,791
Nok Du.

463
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,503
I do not know why you wanted
to scoop up the rice today.

464
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:50,048
You worked hard
to cook other side dishes.

465
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,259
I see. Is that it?

466
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:54,845
Please eat.

467
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,138
- Okay.
- Okay.

468
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,724
Go sit down. Sit down.

469
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,186
Gosh, the rice is nice and warm.

470
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,149
Stop.

471
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,702
Put down your spoon
for a second.

472
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,120
What is it, Aeng Du?

473
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,205
You should eat...

474
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,668
It is the yolk.

475
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,470
- My goodness.
- What?

476
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,889
What is that?

477
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,224
A fried egg.

478
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:42,059
Look at this fried egg!

479
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,978
Well, there was only one left.

480
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,773
The physician told me
to feed her well.

481
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,441
- She should eat the egg and meat.
- You jerk.

482
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,526
Hurry. Dig in.

483
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,371
- Hey, you should eat it.
- No.

484
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:03,789
You eat it.

485
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,083
- Goodness.
- Oh, gosh.

486
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,501
Look at him.

487
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:10,003
- I cannot watch it.
- My goodness.

488
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,797
You are making these widows
feel very sad right now.

489
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,507
How could we eat now?

490
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:16,260
Stop making a fuss during mealtime.

491
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:17,344
Okay?

492
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:23,141
My gosh. Look at that.

493
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,062
This meal...

494
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,189
is quite sweet. It is indeed.

495
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,109
The meal is sweet, it is sweet.

496
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,528
It is so sweet.

497
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:41,827
Aeng Du.

498
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,037
I will bring
the scorched rice water.

499
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,122
Okay.

500
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,378
I like eggs too, you know.

501
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,046
I will fry one for you next time.

502
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,091
Aeng Du, you can eat meat instead.
Here you go.

503
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,301
Eat up.

504
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,178
Yes, have some meat.

505
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,307
Eat up.

506
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:11,982
I will be able to sneak
into the palace,

507
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,401
but it will not be easy for me
to meet her in person.

508
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:17,154
All you need to do for me is
to make sure she gets the letter.

509
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,828
Hand it over to me.

510
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,672
Thank you.

511
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:38,175
Please be careful.

512
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:41,303
By the way,

513
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,764
if you succeed
in entering the palace,

514
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:47,226
do you think you can find out
how the chancellor is doing?

515
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:52,689
I have actually been meaning
to tell you something.

516
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,197
How could you think of sleeping here
when there are so many eyes on us?

517
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,114
Have you gone mad?

518
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,076
Yes, I have gone mad.
Can I go over to your side now?

519
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,079
What if someone
opens the door to my room?

520
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,082
Hey, who would open the door
to your room at such a late hour?

521
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,250
You are a weird one.

522
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,128
You really make me speechless.

523
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,507
That is only because
I am speaking the truth.

524
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,551
I am going to go to your side, okay?

525
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:25,472
My gosh.

526
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,185
I am tired, so do not try to chat
and go to bed right away.

527
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,104
Okay, fine.

528
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:46,785
Goodnight.

529
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,105
Gosh.

530
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,158
Look at him sleeping.

531
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,121
He always does
what I tell him to do.

532
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:47,364
What? I thought you were sleeping.

533
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:50,242
Are you stupid?
How do you expect me to sleep?

534
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,287
Why can you not sleep?

535
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,331
Are you seriously asking me that
because you do not know?

536
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,418
Just go to sleep.
Stop joking around.

537
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:11,972
Whenever I look at you,
I forget about everything.

538
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,225
I cannot help but smile...

539
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,604
even when I am struggling
and going through a hard time.

540
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,773
It is strange, is it not?

541
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,279
Yes, it is.

542
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,075
I do not understand
why I like a jerk like you.

543
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,168
Keep in mind
that I had my eyes shut.

544
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,129
- You are the one who woke me up.
- What?

545
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:39,268
- My gosh!
- My goodness!

546
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,486
The widows...

547
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,781
all have very terrible
sleeping habits.

548
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,159
I could not get any sleep.

549
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,083
Hey.

550
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:04,668
Aeng Du.

551
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:08,964
- Did you see?
- See what?

552
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:12,801
How you two were stuck together
like glue and kissing each other?

553
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:16,221
Or how you both rolled away
from each other...

554
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,973
as if your bottoms
were caught on fire?

555
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,725
Which one are you talking about?

556
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,144
I guess you saw it all.

557
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:27,024
You know what?
The more I think about it,

558
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:30,152
the more I become sure that you are
no longer fit to be my husband.

559
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:35,282
What am I going to do with a guy
whose heart belongs to someone else?

560
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,017
The dungeon?

561
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,269
He practically lives there.

562
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:05,437
He always comes out of there...

563
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,272
with his royal robe
covered in blood.

564
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:08,857
My goodness.

565
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:12,402
I heard another person
died there last night.

566
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:14,696
Apparently, it was someone
who used to be a high official.

567
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,199
The dungeon was built
for that kind of stuff.

568
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,703
What are you doing
just standing there?

569
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:23,872
Oh, right.

570
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,229
What is with the long face?

571
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,107
Someone ended up dying...

572
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,109
because I lied.

573
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,362
Did you think we would only walk
an elegant and beautiful path?

574
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,990
- That is not what I meant.
- Do not bother to follow me...

575
00:44:58,031 --> 00:44:59,741
if this is how you are going to act
in front of His Majesty.

576
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,118
I will meet him alone.

577
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,847
Do you not work?
Why are you always in the palace?

578
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,683
I have something to do here.

579
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,060
I will be sleeping in the palace
from tonight.

580
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,229
- Why?
- It is for the job.

581
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,606
But it is not mandatory.

582
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,150
I just prefer sleeping here.
Just keep it in mind.

583
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:45,829
What do you think you are doing?

584
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:48,207
Let me go. You can talk to me
after you let go of this.

585
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,835
Let her go, Grand Prince Neungyang.

586
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,553
Have you lost your mind?

587
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,097
I apologize, my lord.

588
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,183
I do not know what this is about,

589
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,102
but there are a lot of eyes
watching you right now.

590
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,660
I looked for you everywhere,
and this is where I find you?

591
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:26,078
What are you doing here?

592
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,746
I had to get a job here.

593
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,165
What do you think you can do
by working here?

594
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,834
Follow me right now.

595
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:32,835
No.

596
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,211
Dong Joo!

597
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:39,007
The Queen has arrived.

598
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:49,560
I came to see...

599
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:53,230
who was brazen enough
to cause such a fuss in the palace.

600
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:55,691
I am surprised to see it was you,
Grand Prince Neungyang.

601
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:57,150
I apologize.

602
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,028
Is your name Dong Joo?

603
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,905
Are you Court Lady Kim's servant?

604
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:05,075
Yes, that is right, Your Highness.

605
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,911
I do not know what this is about,

606
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,956
but she is working for my court lady
which naturally means...

607
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:12,541
that she is working for me.

608
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,793
Do not treat her with disrespect.

609
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,131
You may go.

610
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,769
You may leave as well,
Grand Prince Neungyang.

611
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:47,743
I would like to talk to you.

612
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,371
Yes, Your Highness.

613
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:26,073
What is with your face?

614
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,824
- Why do you look so pale?
- Do not mind me.

615
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,243
How do you expect me to do that?

616
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,287
Hwang Tae,
it is not too late to stop.

617
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,789
- I will...
- No.

618
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:35,749
I cannot stop.

619
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,668
I have come too far.

620
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:40,546
So you really should stop
wasting your time.

621
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,631
What are you talking about?

622
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,095
Hwang Tae, does that jerk
have something on you?

623
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:53,725
No.

624
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:55,727
Do not follow me.

625
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,202
My goodness, we are out of tea.

626
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,328
I will go get some more.

627
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,621
It is for Her Highness,

628
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,206
so bring the best tea there is.

629
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,269
Treason?

630
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,188
The chancellor?

631
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:40,230
Yes.

632
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:43,150
That is the reason why
he got locked up...

633
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:44,610
and ended up losing his life.

634
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:48,197
He was His Majesty's closest friend.
That is so hard to believe.

635
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:50,157
Do you have any evidence?

636
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,117
Who was the accomplice?

637
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,911
Who was he planning
to give the throne to?

638
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,038
His Majesty gave orders
to keep it confidential.

639
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,498
I apologize, Your Majesty.

640
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,711
He definitely seemed like...

641
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,798
he had something
to tell me that day.

642
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:08,634
Pardon?

643
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,261
It is nothing.

644
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,138
You may leave now.

645
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,627
Your Majesty.

646
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:49,049
The chancellor's body
is still inside the palace.

647
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:51,927
And the rest of his family
is nowhere to be found.

648
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:54,221
What should we do?

649
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,599
Leave his dead body
in front of Sigu Gate.

650
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,226
Pardon?

651
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,312
Yun...

652
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:06,525
had already abandoned me
a long time ago.

653
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,738
Thus, I shall do the same.

654
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,991
Yes, Your Majesty.

655
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,284
Your Majesty.

656
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,838
How is your wrist? Is it okay?

657
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,632
You must have been startled.
My gosh.

658
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,551
I really should
teach that jerk a lesson.

659
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,136
I am okay.

660
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:37,181
Nok Du.

661
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,224
Yes?

662
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,605
I just wanted to remind you...

663
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,190
that I will not be going home
starting tonight.

664
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:49,067
Why do you keep reminding me?
It is nothing pleasant.

665
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:51,945
It is okay.
I can come here to see you.

666
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:53,614
Go inside and get some rest.

667
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,115
Okay.

668
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,201
I will be off now. See you tomorrow.

669
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,189
- Hey.
- My gosh.

670
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,527
Are you going to continue
to startle me like this?

671
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,153
I am sorry.

672
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,907
Did you hear about...

673
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:38,951
what happened to the chancellor?

674
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,579
Are you just going to let...

675
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:44,081
Grand Prince Neungyang
have it his way?

676
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,165
No.

677
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,169
I am thinking about
what I should do.

678
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,597
What do not we help each other?

679
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:08,480
Was killing him not enough?

680
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,567
How could he also discard
his dead body like that?

681
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:15,028
How could he do such a thing?

682
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:18,949
I should go see Yun.

683
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,620
Just make sure you meet
Her Highness in time.

684
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:27,332
I will take care of his dead body.

685
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,168
Then let us go together.

686
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,044
You know that it will be dangerous.

687
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:32,880
It will be dangerous for you too.

688
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:34,548
Let us go together.

689
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:40,888
I almost died due to a fever
back when I was a child.

690
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,019
Even my own mother
had given up on saving me.

691
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,732
But the chancellor took me
to a doctor and saved me.

692
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,821
He apparently cried
and begged his father to save me.

693
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,409
And when he did that for me,

694
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:06,830
I experienced more than just
having recovered from the fever.

695
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:10,709
I felt like...

696
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:17,174
I felt like a decent human being
for the first time in my life.

697
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,180
I should be the one to go...

698
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:25,224
since I was granted a decent life
thanks to the chancellor.

699
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:33,148
I am sorry I could not protect you
until the very end.

700
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:55,254
Your Majesty.

701
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,507
You should call
Chief Administrative Officer Yeon...

702
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:00,259
and drink with him.

703
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:06,640
You must pity me.

704
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,559
No, that is not what I meant.

705
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:09,726
Okay, fine.

706
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:11,770
Tell him to come over here.

707
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:39,923
My lord.

708
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:38,815
Where is Jung Yun Jeo?

709
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:41,568
He ran away far from here.
Do not look for him.

710
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:52,162
It will be your head next.

711
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:54,665
Do not hesitate, and answer me.

712
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:58,961
You will behead me
even if I answer your question.

713
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,132
I am not in a rush...

714
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,386
as my master is here.

715
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:15,602
It means that I will not...

716
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:19,189
make things easy for you.

717
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:28,448
I came here...

718
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:32,160
to accompany him
on his last journey, anyway.

719
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,424
You have been alive
for all this time?

720
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,349
Your Highness,

721
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:38,310
do you remember...

722
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:42,272
that I buried His Majesty's son...

723
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,192
20 years ago?

724
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,198
Yes.

725
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:52,824
And you missed
your footing that day.

726
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:55,285
That day, I did not die.

727
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,621
And I am not the only one...

728
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:00,123
who survived that day.

729
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,501
What do you mean?

730
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,256
His Majesty's son...

731
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,928
is alive, Your Highness.

732
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,156
Please...

733
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,117
protect him.

734
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:38,912
"Protect him"? What do you mean?

735
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,790
Where is he?

736
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,462
Where is he?

737
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,137
You must protect him...

738
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,848
from His Majesty.

739
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:00,934
I asked you where my son is!

740
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:06,773
I will risk everything I have
to protect him.

741
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:10,777
Tell me.

742
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,739
Please.

743
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:59,076
Your Majesty!

744
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:19,429
Who is there?

745
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:43,662
Chief Administrative Officer...

746
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,350
Your Majesty!

747
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,145
Your Majesty.
