(Episode 27)

6
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,527
Do you...

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,573
know...

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,992
who I am?

9
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,016
Hurry.

10
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,397
Go now.

11
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,522
You are the royal guard.

12
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,024
May I ask why you are here?

13
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,528
I was looking for the woman
as she was not at the inn.

14
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,112
Pardon?

15
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,534
She ran away just now.

16
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,869
I am sure she came this way.

17
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,746
No one came here.

18
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,207
I will look around here.

19
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,709
Take your guards and go that way.

20
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,670
I will.

21
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,258
But...

22
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,971
why did no one from
the police bureau accompany you?

23
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,807
I understand that we are only trying
to catch a mere woman.

24
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,141
I was in a hurry.

25
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,561
Go on your way now.

26
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,555
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

27
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,765
We are still looking for her,
so we will soon...

28
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,975
That is all right.

29
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,146
A young girl like her
will not be able to do anything.

30
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,065
We will catch her soon enough.

31
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,653
You may go now.

32
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,910
Do you have something else
to report to me?

33
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,413
No, Your Majesty.

34
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,098
Do a secret background research
on the royal guard.

35
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,101
Find out where he lives,
whom he meets, what he does,

36
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,313
and about his house in the south.
Find out everything.

37
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,358
If you find anything suspicious,

38
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,068
tell me at once.

39
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,694
Yes, my lord.

40
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,532
His Majesty must have left
the palace by now.

41
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,033
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,036
He must be outside of Hanyang.

43
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,830
I see.

44
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,749
Then let us return to the palace.

45
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,793
Pardon me?

46
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,671
I will meet with him.

47
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,933
Your Highness.

48
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,104
Let him go this instant.

49
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,939
I will take...

50
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,317
full responsibility.

51
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,251
Do you have something to say to me?

52
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:22,961
No, Your Majesty.

53
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,923
You have been staring at me
all along.

54
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,633
I was being mindless.

55
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,551
Do forgive me.

56
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,429
You do not need to be tense
outside of the palace.

57
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,765
Act as usual.

58
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,809
Yes, Your Majesty.

59
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,854
What do you mean
by that he is with the King?

60
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,856
He knows everything...

61
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,317
and has disguised himself
as the royal guard.

62
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,610
"The royal guard"?

63
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,372
That chief administrative officer
found this?

64
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,333
Yes, Your Highness. He has now
become the royal guard.

65
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,919
Is that so?

66
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,005
I am truly grateful.

67
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,508
By the royal guard,

68
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,678
do you mean...

69
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,560
I am...

70
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,895
the chief administrative officer
of the police bureau.

71
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,399
I had lost my hat at the palace.

72
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,070
That is right.

73
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,448
He is the son of the King
whom I saved...

74
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,450
20 years ago.

75
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,160
Despite knowing everything,

76
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,497
he is with the King? Do you mean...

77
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,128
That is why you cannot
come with me.

78
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,921
I will stop him,

79
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,299
so please stay somewhere safe.

80
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,887
Your Highness,
you must leave right now.

81
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,522
Be safe.

82
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,026
I know this is shameless to ask,

83
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,196
but please...

84
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,073
protect my son.

85
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,169
Your Majesty, do you feel ill?

86
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,422
You must have exhausted yourself
by leaving the palace today.

87
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,132
His Majesty traveled across...

88
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,052
all eight provinces
when he was the Crown Prince.

89
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,887
You do not need to worry
about that.

90
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,056
During the Japanese War,
he stayed at the temporary palace.

91
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,934
He also often stayed
in thatched houses.

92
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,478
Am I not right, Your Majesty?

93
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,608
Of course, I am aware of that.

94
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,777
I had accompanied him back then.

95
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,740
His people, who were in pain,
relied on him very much.

96
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,537
- Is that so?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,999
You risked your life to save
the country and your people.

98
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,209
Your people had hope...

99
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,795
since they knew
you still cared for them.

100
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,464
How could I have abandoned
my people...

101
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,717
who were like my own children?

102
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,971
I just did what I should have done.

103
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,767
Therefore,

104
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,395
I must kill...

105
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:15,939
that boy.

106
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,316
Your Majesty.

107
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,277
He is your son.

108
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,531
You already tried to kill him once,
and he barely managed to live.

109
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,034
That boy is your son, Your Majesty!

110
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,577
He should not have lived.

111
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,412
He should not have survived!

112
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,665
What are you doing?

113
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,628
I must make sure
things are safe outside.

114
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,839
I apologize, but may I
excuse myself, Your Majesty?

115
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,217
Hey, how dare you behave this way
in front of His Majesty?

116
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,301
Well,

117
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,678
I understand
that he might find it boring...

118
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,014
to listen to our stories
of the past.

119
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,267
You may excuse yourself.

120
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,450
I miss her so much.

121
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,001
Nok...

122
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,260
Dong Joo.

123
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,984
Have you lost your mind?

124
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,695
How could you just leave like that?

125
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,950
We are planning to stay here
for another night,

126
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,826
so I wanted to check
the surroundings.

127
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:15,994
Yes, I know that.

128
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,955
But did you have to do that now?

129
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,875
Whatever the case,

130
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,711
make sure everything is done
by 10:30pm...

131
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,339
I told you that I will make sure
everything is taken care of.

132
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:32,845
Okay.

133
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,721
Let us go inside.

134
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,396
What is the matter?

135
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,398
Is someone here?

136
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,025
Who would be here?

137
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,527
Let us go back inside.

138
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,409
Your Majesty!

139
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,083
Jung Yun Jeo...

140
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,752
has escaped from his cell,
Your Majesty.

141
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,713
How could a prisoner
escape from his cell?

142
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,639
I apologize, Your Majesty!

143
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,685
It seems like...

144
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,980
the Queen helped
Jung Yun Jeo escape...

145
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,982
and disappeared with him.

146
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,108
What?

147
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,194
I cannot believe them.

148
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:10,878
Your Majesty.

149
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,063
They are trying to get rid of me...

150
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,816
so they could give him the throne.

151
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,027
My throne...

152
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,699
Send a messenger and tell them
to strengthen the palace security.

153
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,535
Then find the missing prisoner
and Queen.

154
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,914
I must head back to Hanyang
right now.

155
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,874
Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:03,180
Your Majesty, what about
your visit to the shrines?

157
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,724
What is the fastest route
back to Hanyang?

158
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,227
The fastest way to get there
is to climb that mountain.

159
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,937
Then let us take that route.

160
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,814
We have no time to waste.

161
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,316
Let us hurry.

162
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,776
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,383
We will be taking a different route,

164
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,009
so you must go
before everyone else...

165
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,886
and make sure
nothing unexpected happens.

166
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,346
- Yes, master.
- Yes, master.

167
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,693
Drop your weapon.

168
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,650
Did we not meet yesterday?

169
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,739
I guess our paths overlapped.

170
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,116
Seeing that you fought
the royal forces,

171
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,077
you must be
walking a shameless path.

172
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,748
That is funny coming from you.

173
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,710
Our situations
do not seem that different.

174
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,925
I advise you to stop
following His Majesty.

175
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,553
You seem very unfamiliar
with whatever you are doing.

176
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,263
What about you?

177
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,390
Are you a competent warrior?

178
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,145
I am not here to harm anyone.

179
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,773
I am here to protect
the person I care about.

180
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,067
Is that person...

181
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,028
His Majesty?

182
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,197
If that was the case,
I would not have killed the guard.

183
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,576
Then there is nothing for you
to worry about.

184
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,787
Just stay out of my way.

185
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,208
What you are planning to do
is impossible.

186
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,294
Even if you do succeed,

187
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,963
you will end up getting killed.

188
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,925
Do you still want to do it?

189
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,846
I am doing it because I must.

190
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,225
I promised my late mother...

191
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,603
that I will take revenge
on our family's enemy.

192
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,982
You promised your mother...

193
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,943
that you would kill someone?

194
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,364
Yes.

195
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,576
So please pretend
you did not see me here.

196
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,704
- Please.
- That is a lie.

197
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,748
There are
no such parents in this world.

198
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,792
Pardon?

199
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,878
No matter how unfair it was
for them to be killed,

200
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:22,296
asking the daughter,
the only survivor,

201
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,882
to kill someone
to take their revenge...

202
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,011
No parent would ask such a thing.

203
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,637
You do not know anything.

204
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,347
Of course, I do.

205
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,099
I am a parent too.

206
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,310
And that is what I fear the most
right now.

207
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,147
I fear that my son...

208
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,608
might waste his precious life...

209
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,443
trying to take his revenge.

210
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,487
And that he might ruin his life.

211
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,171
I am sure your family wanted...

212
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:09,259
at least you to be
happy and at peace in this life,

213
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,764
instead of living in pure torment
and dreaming of revenge.

214
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,142
That is what parents want.

215
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,442
Wake up.

216
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,278
Wake up, Eun Seo.

217
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,115
Mother.

218
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,242
Live.

219
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,411
Make sure...

220
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,997
you live.

221
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,751
Make sure you live, so...

222
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:47,881
Mother.

223
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:50,592
Do not be sorry.

224
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,137
Be sad...

225
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,599
only briefly.

226
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,731
And forget about
all the awful things.

227
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,528
Forget everything. And make sure...

228
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,948
Make sure you live,

229
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,658
my baby.

230
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,912
Mother.

231
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,915
- Mother.
- My baby.

232
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,294
Eun Seo.

233
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,639
Mother.

234
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:43,145
Mother.

235
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,152
Mother.

236
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,539
She told me not to be sorry...

237
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,960
and forget about everything.

238
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,713
But how?

239
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,760
My whole family died
right in front of me.

240
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,305
Everyone died
and left me all alone here.

241
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,142
How could I be happy in this life?

242
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,353
How?

243
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,356
What do they want me to do?

244
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:37,950
I am sorry.

245
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,786
I meddled with your life too much.

246
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,918
But please give what I said
some consideration.

247
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,212
Think if that is truly
what you want.

248
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,432
- Your Majesty.
- Tell me.

249
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,269
The bridge leading to the town
broke down all of a sudden.

250
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,354
Most of the courtiers and guards...

251
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,648
are taking the route
around the mountain.

252
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,068
The sun will set soon,
and it is raining now.

253
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,070
It will take longer than a day.

254
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,990
You must stay here tonight.

255
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,326
Anyway,
as soon as everyone gets here,

256
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:03,869
I will leave right away.

257
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,245
Yes, Your Majesty.

258
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,416
Breaking the bridge
to isolate him in the town?

259
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,793
You have come up with a novel idea.

260
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,670
It would have been possible
without the guards...

261
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,714
you secretly brought
to keep an eye on me.

262
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,341
I ought to give you the credit.

263
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,260
Anyway, make haste.

264
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,971
We must take the King
before the other guards arrive.

265
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,682
Stop meddling with my business,
and contact your people in Hanyang.

266
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,685
I will be there on time as promised.
Tell them to proceed as planned.

267
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,192
How rude.

268
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,123
I am sure your family wanted...

269
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:54,044
at least you to be
happy and at peace in this life...

270
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,549
instead of living in pure torment
and dreaming of revenge.

271
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,011
That is what parents want.

272
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,558
He does not know
what he is talking about.

273
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:22,114
Earlier,

274
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:26,493
you said they tightened the security
at the palace. Please explain why.

275
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,205
Are you afraid?

276
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,040
That is not what I meant.

277
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:35,335
We have come thus far together.
You ought to be brave now.

278
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,963
Please do not worry.

279
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,049
Our plan will go smoothly.

280
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,011
What is happening?

281
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,696
We have a problem.

282
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,699
- Open the gate.
- Pardon?

283
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,786
This is treason.
I see soldiers outside.

284
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:51,912
This is a revolt.

285
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,709
And I also participated
in this revolt.

286
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,586
If you want...

287
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,047
to risk your life
to protect the current King,

288
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,093
you must come forward
and slay me first.

289
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,141
Does the King deserve
such loyalty from you?

290
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,854
Open the gate now!

291
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,610
Why did you have to be born
on the 19th of November?

292
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,445
Why...

293
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,865
Why does it have to be today?

294
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:16,413
Hey.

295
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,630
I was told
that you wanted to see me.

296
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,965
I wanted to have a drink with you.

297
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:28,842
Sit down.

298
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:38,977
Drink it.

299
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,989
I am sure one drink will be okay.

300
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,617
No. I cannot.

301
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,789
I must have chosen
a great royal guard for myself.

302
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:03,752
Right. Did you send
a letter to your family?

303
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,755
You passed the exam
and got promoted too.

304
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:12,970
No, I did not have the chance yet.

305
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,974
I see. Your father's mind
must be made up.

306
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,185
You are still hesitant
to talk to him.

307
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,689
And...

308
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:27,359
he is benevolent
and warmhearted too.

309
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,654
When I have failed as a son,
he still...

310
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:32,990
He always...

311
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,000
I did not know...

312
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,628
a father and a son
could love each other this much.

313
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,757
I am envious.

314
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,976
I was afraid
to stand before my father.

315
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,771
It felt as if I was standing
on thin ice.

316
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,857
I always held my breath...

317
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,027
and had to stand firm to the toes.

318
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,823
I always thought
it was because I was scared...

319
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,702
to be abandoned or kicked out.

320
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,415
But in retrospect,

321
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,460
I just...

322
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,632
wanted to be loved by him
at least once.

323
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,300
That was all.

324
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:39,306
At least once.

325
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:49,775
I know...

326
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,904
that I do not deserve to say this.

327
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,909
Had I not known anything,

328
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,037
and had I lived as a father...

329
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,666
who adored his own son...

330
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,460
Do you...

331
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,296
regret it?

332
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,510
The thin ice has cracked,

333
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,970
and I have been floundering...

334
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:19,763
in icy cold water for a long time.

335
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:23,016
It does not matter
if I regret my action or not.

336
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,107
I must lie down.

337
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,556
At this rate, the guards
might arrive anytime soon.

338
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,932
It was not easy to separate them
from the King.

339
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,312
Do not tell me
that you have other intentions.

340
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,773
Now that you are about
to execute the deed,

341
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,317
are you going soft
because he is your...

342
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:17,196
I dare you. He is not my father.

343
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:20,115
Forget about bringing him to
the palace. I want to kill him now.

344
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,700
I am hanging by a thread.

345
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,870
Unless you want me to kill you,
shut your mouth.

346
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,624
Are you out of your mind?

347
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,667
The King must arrive
at the palace alive.

348
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,793
Are you trying to sabotage the plan?

349
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,795
If you want to carry out
the revolt successfully...

350
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,172
with your absurd justification,

351
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:36,882
be quiet.

352
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:38,759
"Be quiet"?

353
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,844
What if I do not stay quiet?
What will you do?

354
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,221
What?

355
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,349
Will you kill the King right here?

356
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,726
You must have lost your mind.

357
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,940
That rude...

358
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,663
Your Highness.

359
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,665
Let us go.

360
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,977
We have taken control
of the soldiers...

361
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,562
and seized the post station as well.

362
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,356
And Queen Dowager
is escorted to the palace too.

363
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,950
As long as
your brother does his part,

364
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,202
you will soon greet a new king.

365
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:48,787
Once you ascend to the throne,

366
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,707
will you keep your promise
you made to me?

367
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,126
That also depends on your brother.

368
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,672
If Nok Du finishes his job...

369
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,424
and the revolt is successful...

370
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:01,758
I will kill him...

371
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:04,219
as I told you.

372
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,432
Why?

373
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,726
Does that bother you?

374
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:14,938
No.

375
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:17,858
All I ask is
that you keep your promise to me.

376
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:48,740
Your Majesty.

377
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,909
This is Chief
Administrative Officer Baek.

378
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:53,495
Yes.

379
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,164
Come in.

380
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,930
What is this about?

381
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:14,474
Well...

382
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,269
It is...

383
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:18,812
Speak.

384
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:21,982
Did you find the prisoner
and the Queen?

385
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,278
It is not about them.

386
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,782
It is about your royal guard.

387
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:51,470
Yeon Soo...

388
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,431
is dead?

389
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:56,517
Yes.

390
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:00,020
Even his family did not know...

391
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,105
as they stopped exchanging letters
a long time ago.

392
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:05,275
He died from a chronic illness
a very long time ago.

393
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:06,318
Then,

394
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:08,612
what about my royal guard?

395
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,032
Who on earth is he?

396
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,909
Something was off about him,

397
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,412
so I looked into the Yeon family.

398
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,165
When I investigated him,

399
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,502
I heard a name.

400
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,307
Nok Du.

401
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,728
Did you say his name was Nok Du?

402
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,356
Yes, Your Majesty.

403
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,985
They called him by that name.

404
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:54,700
Then...

405
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,452
he is...

406
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,454
He is your son...

407
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,875
whom Jung Yun Jeo took care of.

408
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:07,838
That cannot be.

409
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:11,633
That is impossible.

410
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,636
- Your Majesty...
- I must see him.

411
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,014
He will have to explain it
to me himself.

412
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:19,850
Bring him to me.

413
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,145
Yes, Your Majesty.

414
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,826
You seem to be worried
about something.

415
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,204
Yes.

416
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,372
I am.

417
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:44,583
There is something I must know...

418
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,960
although I do not want to.

419
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,963
I am afraid I will find out
about it.

420
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:54,384
- Hurry up.
- Goodness.

421
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:58,680
You and I are like friends.

422
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:01,725
Is that so?

423
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:03,393
Why are you...

424
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,438
crying?

425
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:20,035
No, Your Majesty.

426
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:25,082
I had trusted you...

427
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,503
completely.

428
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:32,714
So how dare you?

429
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:35,342
How dare you?

430
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:55,654
How dare you deceive me...

431
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:57,865
while lingering by my side?

432
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,120
Your Majesty.

433
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:04,997
Hurry!

434
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,813
We cannot waste any more time.

435
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,649
We will bring the King
to the palace.

436
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:34,776
You may kill the royal guard...

437
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:37,446
and those who get in your way.

438
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,949
Let us go.

439
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,724
Are you not
the Chief Royal Secretary?

440
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,769
Yes, Your Majesty. You are correct.

441
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,688
It is getting late.

442
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,483
You should not be
at such a dangerous place.

443
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,986
That is none of your business.

444
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,613
But...

445
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,698
why have you brought
these armed men?

446
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:23,659
It is, indeed, my business.

447
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:29,498
I must secretly escort you
back to the palace...

448
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,708
by tonight.

449
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,127
What?

450
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:37,756
Get him!

451
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,119
Is it you,
the Chief Royal Secretary?

452
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,634
Your Majesty.

453
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:24,678
It is me.

454
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:26,805
Are you not...

455
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,600
Dong Joo?

456
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,144
Why are you here?

457
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:34,897
Why are you dressed like so?

458
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,815
Please...

459
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,943
throw your sword down the cliff.

460
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,195
What?

461
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,323
What are you saying?

462
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:49,828
Please.

463
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,422
If you do as I say,
I will answer your questions.

464
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:02,758
If you refuse...

465
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,864
Your Majesty!

466
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,699
Your Majesty!

467
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:29,993
Your Majesty!

468
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:31,870
Your Majesty!

469
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,331
Your Majesty!

470
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,099
Your Majesty!

471
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,393
Your Majesty!

472
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,479
Your Majesty!

473
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,379
Are you happy now?

474
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:27,134
Now tell me why
you are doing this to me.

475
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:28,969
First,

476
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:31,597
my name is...

477
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,224
Yu Eun Seo.

478
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,310
"Yu Eun Seo"?

479
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,603
Not only did you kill
my entire family...

480
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,188
because you believed
they conspired against you,

481
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,316
but you were going
to dig up their graves.

482
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,110
Yu Yeon Kyung.

483
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,322
Then are you...

484
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:52,117
his granddaughter,
the sole survivor?

485
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,203
Yes.

486
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,455
He was my grandfather.

487
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,667
He was the one who told me...

488
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:03,212
to do everything I wanted to do
even though I was a woman.

489
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,973
You became an orphan
at such a young age.

490
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:18,769
It must have been tough.

491
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:20,812
And it is all thanks to you.

492
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:25,484
Thanks to you, I have learned
how to make and use a bow.

493
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:28,779
Are you going to kill me?

494
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:30,948
Yes.

495
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:39,831
So this is why you approached me,
just like he did.

496
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,166
Fine.

497
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,961
Did he scheme my assassination
with you?

498
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,588
What do you mean?

499
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,592
Do you think I killed
your grandfather for no reason?

500
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,803
That is incorrect.
Had I not killed him,

501
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,930
he would have killed me instead...

502
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,807
and replaced me with a new king.

503
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,725
That was...

504
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:02,855
the reality back then
when your grandfather was alive!

505
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:05,607
Look!

506
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,901
See for yourself
who is eyeing my throne!

507
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:10,445
It is my own son!

508
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:13,156
It is him
whom I had thought was dead!

509
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:18,787
What did you just say?

510
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:20,789
Nok Du is...

511
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:23,250
The King killed your whole family...

512
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,797
and dragged your life to the gutter.

513
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:30,215
You despise him...

514
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,343
with all your heart and are
desperately trying to kill...

515
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:34,845
that darn King.

516
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:37,472
He is the King's...

517
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,643
He is the son of the King.

518
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:45,272
I am going to right what is wrong.

519
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,442
I must protect my father.

520
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,654
Do you think I will let that happen?

521
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:54,573
I will kill him first.

522
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:55,949
I can do that.

523
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:58,202
There is no reason I cannot!

524
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,413
You are going to kill your son?

525
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:03,749
Yes.

526
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,836
I am willing to kill anyone...

527
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,089
who wishes
to steal the throne from me!

528
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,597
Does Nok Du know...

529
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:21,975
that this is how you feel about him?

530
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:24,186
I am sure he does.

531
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:27,564
He has disguised himself,
stayed by my side,

532
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,192
heard, and seen everything.

533
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:48,710
You are crazy.

534
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:56,677
Yes.

535
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:00,806
You have to be crazy
to endure the throne.

536
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:04,351
I have dreamt...

537
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:07,771
of killing you for the longest time.

538
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,692
I thought I would feel
relieved and happy.

539
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,027
But I was wrong.

540
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,157
I cannot believe I wasted
all those years...

541
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,326
only to kill a beast like you.

542
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:23,996
I cannot believe I hurt him
for a man like you.

543
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,749
What did you just say?

544
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,669
You may be
the highest of all ranks...

545
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,505
and have the world at your feet.

546
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:37,467
But you are already a dead man.

547
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:40,679
You cannot trust anyone.

548
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:42,890
And no one trusts you either.

549
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:45,475
You are just an empty shell.

550
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,116
You are not...

551
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:26,743
even worth killing.

552
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:12,891
Have you seen His Majesty?

553
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,893
I heard he went out looking for you.

554
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:20,607
I have something to tell you.

555
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,793
Your Highness, we have a problem.

556
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,465
Grand Prince Neungyang
has plotted a revolt?

557
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,842
His Majesty fell down the cliff,

558
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,845
and there is a conspiracy going on
at the palace?

559
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:34,806
Yes, while people search
for His Majesty,

560
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,559
I will be at the palace
at the promised time.

561
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:40,062
You and the soldiers here
should come with me.

562
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,731
We must find His Majesty...

563
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:45,317
and stop the revolt.

564
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,110
Send a message...

565
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:49,530
and gather soldiers
from all the nearby areas.

566
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:52,616
They must hurry up
and arrive at the palace in time,

567
00:58:52,824 --> 00:58:53,867
while we do what we can to stall.

568
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:55,244
If what you say is true,

569
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,497
the soldiers we have here
will not be enough.

570
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:00,332
Yes, I know.

571
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,459
We will have to hang in there.

572
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:47,671
Good work.

573
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,779
What do you think you are doing?

574
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,034
I am here to clear up
all the traitors.

575
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:20,204
If you regret your decision,
you are free to change your mind.

576
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:21,830
I promise that you will be forgiven.

577
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:24,875
No one?

578
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,378
Then I guess I have no choice.

579
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,255
Come inside.

580
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:08,001
(The Tale of Nokdu)

581
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:10,337
I am sorry.

582
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,673
I did not know you were alive.

583
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:14,508
You wish to be the king
when no one even knows...

584
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:15,509
how you were raised?

585
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,928
You were a playboy who used to
spend time at a gisaeng house.

586
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,100
I do not want
to hide anymore, Father.

587
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:24,560
Let us leave the palace first.

588
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:25,686
If we stay here...

589
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,939
Father! Father!

590
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,149
How could you come back here?

591
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:32,317
I will go wherever...

592
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:34,653
whether it may be a battlefield
or a place that is burning down.

593
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:37,447
I told you already.

594
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,867
I can no longer live without you.
