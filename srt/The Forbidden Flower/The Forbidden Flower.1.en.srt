00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,010
Hurry up then.

174
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,560
I'll wait for you inside.

175
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,440
Done.

176
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,200
How much is it?

177
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,490
As you please.

178
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,130
I've transferred the money.

179
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Sir, to Jiannan Homeland, please.

180
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,250
Okay.

181
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,490
It's all right.

182
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,130
I'll get going.

183
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,440
Thank you.

184
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,490
(The caretaker)

185
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,690
(and uncle next door.)

186
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,360
Ma'am.

187
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,770
Ran.

188
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,490
You are finally back.

189
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,930
Mrs. Qiu said she couldn't reach you.

190
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,880
She almost thought you had an accident.

191
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,050
I'm fine.

192
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,730
My phone ran out of battery
and turned off automatically.

193
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,690
That's a relief.

194
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,010
You know what?

195
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,970
When Mrs. Qiu called

196
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,560
and found out you hadn't come home yet,

197
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,010
she was so anxious.

198
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,690
Oh, right.

199
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,970
Hurry up and eat.

200
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,050
Today, I cooked all
your favourite dishes,

201
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,970
which Mrs. Qiu specifically requested.

202
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,740
Hello.

203
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,600
Mrs. Qiu.

204
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,220
Hello.

205
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,490
(Zhang, has Ranran returned home?)

206
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,840
Yes.

207
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,560
She said her phone
turned off automatically.

208
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,080
I made the blood tonic food
according to your instructions,

209
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,360
but she wouldn't eat it.

210
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,970
She didn't drink the soup either.

211
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,290
Yes.

212
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,290
I'll bring

213
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
the medicine to her room later

214
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,640
and make sure she takes it.

215
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,400
Yes.

216
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,690
Don't you worry, Mrs. Qiu.

217
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,010
I'll be sure to keep an eye on her

218
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,400
and won't let her go anywhere.

219
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,450
(I need to find a way out.)

220
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,180
(Let me do some matchmaking.)

221
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,780
(1036 Yushui Residence,
Qiongzhou City (1038))

222
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,530
Ran.

223
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,360
You're down.

224
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,560
I was thinking of
bringing you the medicine

225
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,210
after I've done the dishes.

226
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,010
I'm glad you've taken it.

227
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,640
By the way, ma'am,

228
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,360
this package seems to be
delivered to the wrong place.

229
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,050
It's for next door.

230
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
Why don't you send it to him later?

231
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,360
I'll bring it to him as soon as
I've finished cleaning the room.

232
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,640
I'll go upstairs first.

233
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Have a good rest.

234
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,800
You are mistaken.
This is not ours.

235
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,010
I'm so sorry.

236
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,930
Are you busy in the afternoon?

237
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,490
If not, come to my place.

238
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,840
My son just sent Daokou
roast chicken from home.

239
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,010
It's so delicious.

240
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,450
Really?

241
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,930
Okay, then I will make some appetizers.

242
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,930
So you can have a drink.

243
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,530
Great.

244
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:17,970
Wait.

245
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,490
What's wrong?

246
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,290
I can only go later.

247
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,250
My hostess has strict rules.

248
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,160
The young lady will be
taking an afternoon nap.

249
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
I'll go by then.

250
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Okay.

251
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,880
She's taken a long sleep.

252
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,640
She only woke up at lunchtime.

253
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,210
Yes, Mrs. Qiu.

254
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,120
I made the pork liver soup
as you instructed,

255
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,970
but she only drank a little.

256
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,840
She has taken her medication on time

257
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,290
and is now taking a nap.

258
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,880
Don't you worry, Mrs. Qiu.

259
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,450
I will take good care of her.

260
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm watching her at home.

261
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
I won't let her go out.

262
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,690
Here.

263
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,010
Let me carry it.

264
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,290
Sorry to trouble you
to picking me up.

265
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,450
No problem at all.

266
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,250
Sir, go to Xiaozhou Village.

267
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,500
(Hairdressing)

268
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,320
Are you here for your phone?

269
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,080
I'm not sure if I left it here.

270
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,050
It's here.

271
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,400
Okay.

272
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,360
Thank you.

273
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,770
Dry yourself.

274
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,560
Thank you.

275
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,290
Umbrella.

276
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,210
The road was slippery.

277
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,560
I accidentally slipped.

278
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,080
It doesn't hurt.

279
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,050
Let me send you off.

280
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,800
Okay.

281
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:24,800
Be careful.

No.

299
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,290
(He didn't deny it.)

300
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,400
(Is that woman really his girlfriend?)

301
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Look who's here.

302
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,640
Xiao?

303
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,360
What's up? Did you finally get a date

304
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,120
after being single for such a long time.

305
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,450
Why don't you introduce her to me?

306
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,600
Don't talk nonsense.

307
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,690
My name is He Ran.

308
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,250
I'm his customer.

309
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,600
I came to pick up the phone
I left in his salon.

310
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,400
Hello, Ms. He.

311
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,970
My name is Fatty,

312
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,290
Xiao's buddy.

313
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,080
This is my wife's barbecue restaurant.

314
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,930
Please come often.

315
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Well,

316
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,930
ask Xiao to treat you.

317
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,320
Fine, it's my treat.

318
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,250
Gosh.

319
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,450
- I'll see you off here.
- Thanks.

320
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,160
Take this umbrella.

321
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,770
I will return it to you tomorrow.

322
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,730
No need.

323
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,210
It's okay.

324
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,560
Is she just going to leave?

325
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,400
Hey girl,

326
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,880
come on in.

327
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,120
My wife is grilling some skewers.

328
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,560
No rush. It's raining so hard.

329
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,360
Stop her.

330
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,360
Girl...

331
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,080
You...

332
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,360
Xiao has such a temper.

333
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,730
Please come often.

334
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,210
I'm leaving.

335
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,050
Bye.

336
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,800
Bye.

337
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,530
Right.

338
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,530
Why are you back?

339
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,840
Tomorrow is your birthday.

340
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,560
Of course I'll come back for you.

341
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,560
Silly girl.

342
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,250
I'd forgotten about it,

343
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,560
but you still remember.

344
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:05,930
Ranran, look at

345
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,050
your dress.

346
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,840
I just grabbed it from the wardrobe.

347
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,690
Does it look bad?

348
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,560
No.

349
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,080
You look good in anything.

350
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,210
I stay at home all day anyway.

351
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,800
No one looks at what I'm wearing.

352
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,250
How come?

353
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,320
I'm here.

354
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,010
I like it when you're dressed up.

355
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,320
I'll order you some more

356
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,050
of the latest
spring-summer dresses,

357
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,600
okay?

358
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,600
Mother, no need.

359
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,050
Just leave it to me.

360
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,450
I'll have them
delivered to you tomorrow.

361
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,690
All right, you make the call.

362
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,770
Do as you wish.

363
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,530
Mother, I'm sleepy.

364
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,730
I want to get some more rest.

365
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,800
Really?

366
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
You certainly need more rest.

367
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,120
Go to bed then.

368
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,800
Okay.

369
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,050
Let me help you.

370
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,250
Umbrella.

371
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,770
The road was slippery.

372
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,120
I accidentally slipped.

373
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,530
Let me send you off.

374
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,530
(Although he looks rather
cool on the outside,)

375
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,010
(he seems to be a very
nice and gentle man.)

376
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
(However,)

377
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,010
(what if he is not single?)

378
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,690
(Should I go to him again?)

379
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,800
Where did Ran get that dress on her?

380
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,800
What's the matter with you?

381
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,530
I've told you many times.

382
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,120
Ran is different from other children.

383
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,770
She can't touch any of the nasty food

384
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,970
and clothes out there.

385
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,400
I think she bought that dress herself.

386
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,800
Did she go out?

387
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,560
No.

388
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,450
She's been home all day.

389
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,050
I think it was purchased online.

390
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,690
She's had a lot of couriers lately.

391
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,250
I'll go and throw it away now.

392
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,250
Forget it.

393
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,400
No point.

394
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,730
When it's time to collect
the changing clothes,

395
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,290
get rid of it.

396
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,930
Don't let her know.

397
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,880
Yes, Mrs. Qiu.

398
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,770
As you can see, she is

399
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,490
not eating well

400
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,010
and has lost weight again.

401
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,210
I won't go to the company
these few days.

402
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,450
I'll stay with her.

403
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm sure Ran will be delighted

404
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,010
to have you at home with her.

405
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,210
Slow down, Yu.

406
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,800
Hurry up.

407
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,640
Slow down.

408
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,250
Don't tip over the cake.

409
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,880
Ranran, come on down.
