5

I told you he's not my boyfriend.

6

7

17

Why are you here suddenly?

18
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,180
I haven't brushed my teeth
and tidied up.

19
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,140
Why don't you go up and wash
your face first? I'll wait for you.

20
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,580
No.

21

22
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,260
I need to hold you tight

23
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,540
and won't let go easily.

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,860
I have a gift for you.

25
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,940
It's beautiful.

26
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,380
Tell me honestly.

27
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,500
When did you start to like me?

28
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,260
The first time you came to my barbershop

29
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,420
and asked me to cut your hair.

30
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,980
When I was cutting your hair,

31
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,220
you suddenly opened your eyes.

32
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,020
I even asked you to

33
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,580
close your eyes.

34
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,420
You've fallen in love with me
at that time?

35
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,580
I was thinking that

36
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,980
this little girl came to look for me.

37
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,460
I guessed she'd leave something behind

38
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,740
on purpose

39
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,060
and come back to take it.

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,860
Actually when you came

41
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,380
to the barbershop for the first time,

42
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,940
I've recognised you.

43
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,900
I've recognized your voice.

44
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,100
You've even asked for my number

45
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,380
in the dark.

46
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,900
Oh my goodness.

47
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,060
I also recognised your voice first.

48
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,660
I even had a dream when I went home.

49
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,140
What dream?

50
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,940
Well,

51
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,940
the dream has come true.

52
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
What dream?

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,380
It's a secret.

54
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,900
Do you regret anything

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
for being with me?

56
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,260
Yes.

57
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,940
What is it?

58
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,580
I fell asleep the night

59
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,140
when the epiphyllum blossomed.

60
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,060
Why are you still bothered by this?

61
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,700
Of course. It's a lifetime regret.

It's been a while.

344
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,300
It's been a while.

345
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,340
Are you doing well?

346
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,340
Not bad.

347
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,740
When did you come back?

348
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,900
Last week.

349
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,820
I came back last week.

350
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,980
How's your new job?

351
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,740
It's good.

352
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,380
Yuanqi, let's go.

353
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,460
This is the dress you were
wearing in the studio.

354
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,420
Does what you said in the studio

355
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,420
still count?

356
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,020
I...

357
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,180
I've been waiting for you.

358
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,180
Is anyone home?

359
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,100
Anything?

360
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,580
Hello.

361
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,380
You must be Mr. Xiao.

362
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
I'm the manager of Tomorrow Art Studio.

363
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
This is my name card.

364
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,420
Here.

365
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,260
I'm here today

366
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,780
because we got to know that

367
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,500
you have

368
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,180
late Mr. Twinkle's work,

369
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,220
Limerence.

370
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,020
We're very interested in

371
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,900
this painting.

372
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,980
I wonder if you'd like to sell it to us.

373
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
You want to buy this painting?

374
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,420
Yes.

375
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,940
This is only

376
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,420
an ordinary decorative painting.

377
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,340
You're joking.

378
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,100
If this is a decorative painting,

379
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,580
how will I come personally?

380
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Are you worried that

381
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,820
we can't pay you the amount
that you want?

382
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,620
Who is the Mr. Twinkle you mentioned?

383
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,740
Mr. Twinkle

384
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,660
was a very famous painter.

385
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,700
A few paintings of his were

386
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,460
auctioned internationally

387
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
and sold at eight figures.

388
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,940
What's his Chinese name?

389
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,900
What's his Chinese name?

390
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,420
He Litao.

391
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,780
His surname was He?

392
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,380
I know the painter.

393
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,140
Isn't it inappropriate

394
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,380
to hang the painting here?

395
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,180
Don't you need to find

396
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
a safer place?

397
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,900
(Twinkle)

398
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,180
Mr. Xiao,

399
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,380
regarding the painting...

400
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,660
Do you know the symbolic meaning
of transvaal daisy?

401
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,940
Not to be afraid of difficulties.

402
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,380
Pursue one's desired life.

403
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,980
Mr. Xiao, I'm here

404
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,980
to express our sincerity

405
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,660
of not being afraid of difficulties.

406
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,340
My boss told me to tell that

407
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,900
this painting,

408
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,180
Limerence,

409
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,260
can be offered...

410
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,900
I won't sell it.

411
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,820
Mr. Xiao,

412
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,500
won't you consider about it?

413
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,820
If it's about the price,

414
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,060
I think we can negotiate about it.

415
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,260
I won't sell it.

416
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,900
Well...

417
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,340
Okay.

418
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,180
If you change your mind,

419
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,260
do contact us.

420
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,180
I'm leaving now.

421
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,180
Why?

422
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:56,500
