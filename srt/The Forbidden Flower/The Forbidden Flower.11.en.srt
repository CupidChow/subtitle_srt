00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,120
Let's go.

4
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,810
I'm not leaving.

5
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,680
He Ran, seriously?

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,490
You're just going to a college.
Why are you crying like that?

7
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,600
Ranran.

8
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,560
What's the matter? Are you okay?

9
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,930
Ranran, it's okay.

10
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,600
You can come back
during the summer break.

11
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Mother.

12
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,370
Take me to the airport.

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,650
Don't cry. It's okay.

14
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,650
It's okay. Stop crying.

15
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's go.

(Annual Sports Meeting)

19
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,380
(Photography Club Recruiting)

20
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,370
Which clubs are you planning to join?

21
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,370
I went to the recruitment field.

22
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,370
I think Taekwondo is good

23
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
for physical fitness.

24
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Forget about it.

25
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,810
A friend of mine who is
a year older than us

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,050
joined Taekwondo last year

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,530
and was forced to do leg stretch.

28
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,400
He didn't last a week there.

29
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,560
Pick something you like to do,

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,680
based on your own interests.

31
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,370
It's important to be well-rounded.

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,680
It's definitely rewarding.

33
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,090
Anyone who has been there knows it.

34
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,160
You got a point.

35
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,400
Interest is the most important.

36
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,370
I'm not going to go through that.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
Li Yun, which one are you going to join?

38
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,440
My family wants me to
go abroad for further studies.

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,970
So I have to take
the TOEFL and IELTS exams.

40
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,050
I'm not good at English.

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,490
I don't have time for this.

42
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
Jingjing, what about you?

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I'm in need of money.

44
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,840
I have to work as a tutor in
my spare time to earn money.

45
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,600
You seem to come from a decent family.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't believe you need
to earn your own tuition.

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,970
That's not it.

48
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,560
I want to travel abroad on holiday,

49
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,970
but my parents said

50
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,090
I have to work hard

51
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,400
to build a good life.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
That's why I do odd jobs.

53
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,650
Which one should I join?

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm a person who can't be idle.

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,090
I have to find something

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,560
that interests me.

57
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,650
That's it.

58
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,880
Focus on your interest.

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,400
You've come to your senses.

60
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,570
Take a look at this.

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't you want to develop a hobby?

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,650
This art club is exceptional.

63
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,720
Seriously? How do you know?

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,530
I'm serious. Our senior had joined it.

65
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,920
Look.

66
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,010
This is the president.

67
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,330
Handsome, right?

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
He is quite good-looking.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
He studies painting.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
He must be very artistic.

71
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,800
However,

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
I don't know anyone

73
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,530
in the new club.

74
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,890
I'm afraid I won't fit in.

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
It will be so awkward.

76
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,530
I'm not very outgoing.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
Besides, I can't draw either.

78
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,690
Will I become

79
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,010
a joke at the art club?

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,690
He Ran.

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,040
Can you draw?

82
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,240
Yes, He Ran.

83
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,480
I see that you have
painting tools under the table.

84
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
You look very professional.

85
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,570
Do you want to join the art club with me?

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Then I can ask you
if I have any problems.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,450
I'm not interested.

88
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
Just go with her.

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,010
The president of the art club
is really handsome.

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
By the way, I forgot to ask you.

91
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,130
Do you have a boyfriend?

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Yes, He Ran.

93
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,240
We're all still single.

94
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,530
Do you have a boyfriend?

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,650
Yes.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
She has.

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,400
That summer,

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,690
she fell in love with a man.

99
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,240
No one knew about it.

100
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,480
What did she say?

101
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,480
She said she has a boyfriend.

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
Seriously?

103
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,890
Do you believe her?

104
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,010
No.

105
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Why not?

106
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
She's not bad looking.

107
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,840
She's quite a looker.

108
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,570
Given her personality, no.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,690
That's true. She seems quite gloomy.

110
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,530
Yes.

111
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,970
When I first met her,

112
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,280
we were afraid to talk to her.

113
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,720
She's not that scary.

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,330
She's just a bit of an introvert
and not talkative.

115
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,360
That's not it.

116
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,130
It's her whole persona that exudes

117
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,690
an aura of indifference

118
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,480
and coldness.

119
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,090
Isn't it?

120
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,720
Yes.

121
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,970
Exactly.

122
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,280
You go.

123
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,980
(Han Yu)

124
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,920
Pass it to her.

125
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,420
He Ran, your phone keeps ringing.

126
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,600
It rang a few times.

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,770
It's someone called Han Yu.

128
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,450
Is he your boyfriend?

129
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,160
Ignore him.

130
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,280
But it keeps ringing.

131
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,650
Maybe it's something urgent.

132
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Then help me turn off
my phone. Thank you.

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,160
Hang it up.

134
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,090
Come here.

135
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,450
Okay.

136
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,600
What's going on?

137
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,480
I don't think that's her boyfriend.

138
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,210
Who treats their boyfriends

139
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,210
with such an attitude?

140
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,280
You're right.

141
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,480
You got a point.

142
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,770
Maybe she doesn't have a boyfriend.

143
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,400
Let's make a bet.

144
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,970
Three burgers.

145
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,010
Ten burgers.

146
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
Okay, I'm in.

147
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,970
I think she has a boyfriend.

148
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,600
Then I bet she doesn't have a boyfriend.

149
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,890
Ten burgers. You'll lose for sure.

150
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,970
I believe she has,

151
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,280
but not Han Yu.

152
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,170
A mysterious...

153
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,170
Man.

154
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,210
He Ran, I left your phone on

155
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,520
in case there was an emergency.

156
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,120
He Ran.

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,330
What took you so long
to answer my calls?

158
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,450
I've called you a dozen times.

159
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,810
I thought something happened to you.

160
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,210
Seriously.

161
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,330
Do you ever think of me as a friend?

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,810
You've been in Xijing for so long,

163
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,480
yet you never come to me
unless I reach out to you.

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,410
I'm so disappointed.

165
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,360
Of course,

166
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,240
I'm too popular

167
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,600
in my workplace.

168
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,760
So I've been busy.

169
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,570
But I call you

170
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,690
as soon as I'm done.

171
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,330
What are you calling for?

172
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,090
I miss you.

173
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,090
No other reason.

174
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,880
What, am I not allowed to call you?

175
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,050
You're so boring.

176
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
I'll hang up now.

177
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,360
Wait.

178
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
Don't hang up.

179
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,120
I have a surprise for you.

180
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,930
What surprise?

181
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,720
He Ran!

182
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,480
I'm outside your dorm.

183
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,210
Surprise, right?

184
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,000
Come on down.

185
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm not in the dorm.

186
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,330
You're not?

187
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,520
Then where are you?

188
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,520
I am outside to do something.

189
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,090
But...

190
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,810
Don't look for me.

191
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Wait.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,760
Let's go.

193
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,600
He's not bad looking.

194
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,600
He's dressed like an idol star.

195
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,720
She doesn't even fancy this kind of man.

196
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,410
I wonder how her boyfriend is.

197
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,450
Is he

198
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,170
really not her boyfriend?

199
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
Certainly not.

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Look at her attitude toward him.

201
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,410
No man can stand that.

202
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,480
And I think

203
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,880
the guy downstairs is pretty good.

204
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,290
You're drooling.

205
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,900
(Tropical Flowers)

206
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,240
Excuse me.

207
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,170
Is this painting book still available?

208
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Monet's book is out of stock.

209
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,360
This is a limited edition,

210
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,970
of which there are
only three in the store.

211
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,570
This is the last one left.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,360
You can take a look
at other painters' book.

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,330
Thank you.

214
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,720
You can have it.

215
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,930
Thank you.

216
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll give you an address.

218
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,810
Can you mail it for me?

219
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,810
Sure. Where would
you like to mail it to?

220
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,480
Chuanxi.

221
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,170
Thank you.

222
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,090
No problem.

223
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,640
Hello.

224
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,120
Hello.

225
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,690
Not that. Look at me.

226
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,570
What's wrong?

227
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,880
This one fits me so well.

228
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,570
Do you think it suits you?

229
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,020
Can you fit?

230
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,170
(House agent Mr. Zhang)

231
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,434
(OK, I want to see the house.
When is convenient for you?)

232
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:27,890
Thank you Jingjing for

233
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,930
(What about tomorrow afternoon?)
buying me a dress.

234
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,420
(I'll see you then.)

235
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,380
(Han Yu)

236
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,720
He Ran.

237
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
My birthday is next Saturday.

238
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,570
If you don't show up,

239
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,970
I'll cut you off,

240
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:45,970
believe it or not.

241
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,720
Okay, send me the address.

242
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,410
So you're still very considerate.

243
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,210
Make sure you look good.

244
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,090
For what?

245
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,840
Is it your birthday or mine?

246
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,930
Of course it's me.

247
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,090
Still,

248
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,210
you have to dress up

249
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,170
for my sake.

250
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,600
If you need a pretty girl,

251
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,360
I'll get my friend.

252
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,090
I promise all of them are pretty,

253
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,450
smart and kind.

254
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,480
You will not

255
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,570
be disappointed.

256
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,520
He Ran, stop kidding me.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,210
Okay, I'll hang up.

258
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,120
Be nice

259
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,170
and don't come empty-handed.

260
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,210
Remember to buy me a present.

261
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,410
Shut up. Bye.

262
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,210
He Ran.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,970
We meet again.

264
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,090
You are He Ran, right?

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,360
Do you remember me?

266
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,640
We met at the bookstore.

267
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,050
I don't remember.

268
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,220
(Diner)

269
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,880
Hello.

270
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,930
Hello.

271
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,170
This one.

272
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,570
I want this one.

273
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,410
Okay, miss.

274
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,290
Is it the birthday of
an elderly family member?

275
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,970
If it's a gift for an elder,

276
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,120
we have a newly arrived

277
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,410
longevity gold foil gift box.

278
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
I can use that to pack for you.

279
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,170
It will look more stylish.

280
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,330
Okay.

281
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,170
Here.

282
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,930
The landlord of this house

283
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,290
seems to be from your university, too.

284
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,240
He bought this house
in his freshman year.

285
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,480
House prices have
skyrocketed in recent years.

286
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,600
He made a lot of money.

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,840
It's a good thing to have

288
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,360
some investment insight.

289
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,000
Is the place soundproof?

290
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,290
Don't worry. These are solid walls.

291
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,240
RMB800 a month is fine.

292
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:14,970
I need it urgently.

293
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,240
When can I sign the contract?

294
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,520
If you have made up your mind,

295
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,170
you can pay the deposit today.

296
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,330
The landlord is

297
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,600
coming over this
afternoon with the title deeds.

298
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,600
You can meet him in person

299
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,360
and feel at ease when
you sign the contract.

300
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,480
Okay.

301
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,000
Well,

302
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,450
the landlord lived here

303
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,600
when he was at college.

304
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,640
I guess he shares your view.

305
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,170
He must have found the dorm
too crowded and noisy

306
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,810
and preferred to live on his own,
which was rather quiet.

307
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,640
He is a postgraduate sophomore.

308
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,330
After graduation, he will go back
to Qiongzhou to work.

309
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,170
He left for his internship

310
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,050
and asked us to rent out the house.

311
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,480
You found us the day

312
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,600
after we put it online.

313
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,120
Why are there so many
painting tools here?

314
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Does he draw too?

315
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,000
These seem to have been
left behind by the landlord

316
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,170
and perhaps not disposed of.

317
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,210
If you think they're in the way,

318
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,410
we'll have someone move them out.

319
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,120
It's okay.

320
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,880
I won't be using much space.
Just leave them here.

321
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
No need to bother you.

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,760
All right.

323
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
When the landlord comes over,
ask him what to do with them.

324
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,000
He got here quickly enough.

325
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,720
I told you this place is strategic.

326
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,690
It takes only 15 minutes
to get from campus to here.

327
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,210
Mr. Zhang, you are here.

328
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,210
Come on in.

329
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,570
Let me introduce you.

330
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,170
This is the landlord and she is...

331
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,210
(Boundless Happiness)

332
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,480
(Boundless Happiness)
No. What are you wearing?

333
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,700
(Boundless Happiness)

334
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,690
Why are you wearing a cap

335
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,930
to my birthday party?

336
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,120
I forgot to wash my hair today.

337
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,640
I didn't want to embarrass you.

338
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I'll take it off if I don't like it.

339
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,450
That's better.

340
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,720
(Live a Long life)

341
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,360
(Live a Long life)
What is this?

342
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,840
(Live a Long life)
A gift. Open it.

343
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,640
(Boundless Happiness)

344
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,760
(Boundless Happiness)
"I wish you boundless happiness

345
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
(Live a Long life)
and a long, long life."

346
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:05,690
You...

347
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,560
You wrapped it up like it was
a gift for my grandfather.

348
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,610
I had it specially wrapped.

349
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,650
This...

350
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,130
What is this ugly thing?

351
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,800
What's ugly about it?

352
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,560
I remember you used to like
to wear this kind of thing.

353
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,410
I... No.

354
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,990
My previous one was

355
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,690
different from this one, okay?

356
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,240
Mine was a limited edition.

357
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
What on earth is this?

358
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,520
Why is it different?

359
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,040
This one is much heavier,

360
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,650
more expensive and in better condition

361
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,520
than your limited edition.

362
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,280
Boss.

363
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,890
I think He Ran must have

364
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,000
done it on purpose.

365
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
Shut up.

366
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,560
No.

367
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,130
You didn't buy this

368
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,410
at that night market you mentioned

369
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,760
that costs RMB5 a metre, did you?

370
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,760
Of course not.

371
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,610
I bought it from a proper gold shop

372
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,000
and chose the heaviest for you,

373
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,130
which is very expensive.

374
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,690
Are you serious?

375
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,170
If you don't believe me, try biting it.

376
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,650
Bite?

377
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,890
Do you even know fashion?

378
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,520
Mine is definitely different from this.

379
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,170
Fine.

380
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:15,970
Forget it.

381
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,480
Let me introduce.

382
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,080
This is my new band.

383
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,610
- New faces.
- Did your previous band

384
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,410
flop?

385
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,520
No. This is

386
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,280
an upgrade.

387
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,480
Of course, the centre is still me.

388
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,930
Zhang Yimin.

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,280
You've seen him before.

390
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,410
Li Nan has changed his profession.

391
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
So I eliminated him.

392
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,080
This is my new bass player,

393
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,850
Wang Da.

394
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,760
There's another one

395
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,760
who hasn't arrived yet.

396
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,210
She's a beauty,

397
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,370
from the same campus as you.

398
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,890
She has a bit of a thing

399
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
for our boss.

400
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,370
Don't talk nonsense.

401
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,370
Yes, don't talk nonsense.

402
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Our boss

403
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,930
has someone in mind.

404
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,280
He has

405
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
remained faithful all these years.

406
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,130
Right, boss?

407
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,040
Yes.

408
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,610
Sorry for being late.

409
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,170
Happy birthday, Han Yu.

410
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,280
Thank you.

411
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,370
Let me introduce.

412
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,720
This is my cousin.

413
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,370
We ran into each other.

414
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,610
So I brought him along.
Hope you don't mind.

415
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,560
I don't mind.

416
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,210
Come one. Be my guest.

417
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,690
Have a seat.

418
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,850
This is Han Yu,

419
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,760
our main vocalist.

420
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,930
I told you about him.

421
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,240
Hello.

422
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,720
Happy birthday.

423
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,650
Thank you.

424
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,040
Your cousin

425
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,410
speaks very softly.

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,850
He's quite different from you.

427
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,480
That's why we are cousins.

428
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,370
He looks a bit like a celebrity.

429
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,320
Cheers.

430
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,000
Happy birthday.

431
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
- Happy birthday, boss.
- Thank you.

432
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,930
Thank you.

433
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,450
Thank you.

434
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,000
Eat up. Don't be shy.

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,970
You are He Ran, right?

436
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,450
Yes, it's me.

437
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,650
However, I have no special relationship

438
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,130
with the person on my left.

439
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,450
He Ran.

440
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,520
Can you show me some respect?

441
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,480
Someone is willing to do that for you.

442
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,890
Who?

443
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,080
Well...

444
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,480
Don't listen to their nonsense.

445
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,760
And don't get the wrong idea.
There's really nothing between us.

446
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,850
I'm not getting the wrong idea

447
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,850
and neither should you.

448
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,000
There's nothing between us, too.

449
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,280
No.

450
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,970
I'm not so bad, am I?

451
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,610
If you don't get along with me,
who will you get along with?

452
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,610
The celebrity-looking guy.

453
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
I think he's pretty good.

454
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,720
Do you two know each other?

455
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,610
No,

456
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,450
but we'll get to know each other

457
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,800
when he gives me a ride home.

458
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,320
He dares?

459
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,610
If he dares,

460
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,690
I'll fight him.

461
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,370
Listen.

462
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,040
None of the cousins are good.

463
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,320
What a strange perception you have.

464
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,690
That's how it is in martial arts dramas.

465
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,800
Han Yu.

466
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,410
I think you should go
to the hospital tomorrow.

467
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,000
Why

468
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,170
should I go to the hospital?
I'm in good health.

469
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,370
Test your IQ.

470
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,080
I don't think your IQ

471
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,370
is above 70.

472
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,520
Seven...

473
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
Have you taken the test?

474
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,000
How much are you?

475
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,040
Around 140.

476
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you.

477
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,320
Look how caring he is.

478
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,760
He's far more sensible than you are.

479
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,000
What can you do?

480
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,850
Don't move.

481
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,890
Nobody move.

482
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,040
Thank you.

483
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,450
No.

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,690
This...

485
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,520
Who's so insensitive?

486
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,610
How dare you laugh.

487
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,370
And you.

488
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,410
Big star.

489
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,850
Handsome brother, happy birthday to you.

490
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,240
Listen.

491
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,410
No one is allowed to
take He Ran home today,

492
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
especially that cousin.

493
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,720
I'm not drunk. I'll drive.

494
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,850
Tell the group when you guys get home.

495
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,210
Okay, through WeChat.

496
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,280
I really like you.
I'll add your WeChat later.

497
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,210
See you.

498
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,130
Take care.

499
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,480
I should have helped out.

500
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,560
Let's go.

501
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,650
He Ran, wait.

502
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,410
Yes?

503
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,170
You left hastily this afternoon

504
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
and forgot your keys.

505
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,280
I don't need the keys.
I'm not renting the house.

506
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,970
Sorry

507
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,520
to bother you today.

508
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,130
I'll reimburse the agent for
any subsequent losses.

509
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,450
You can deal with the agent.

510
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,280
Bye.

511
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,370
He Ran.

512
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,320
I think you have

513
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,320
some misunderstanding about me.

514
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,320
No.

515
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,760
You're overthinking it.

516
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,130
No, I'm not.

517
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,280
What I want you to know is that

518
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,760
I really don't have
any bad intentions for you.

519
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,130
I thought about it.

520
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,520
I think you must have misunderstood me

521
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,560
because of some coincidence.

522
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,240
I promise it was really
just a coincidence.

523
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,720
And I found out about your name

524
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,240
because I studied painting with

525
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,170
a teacher for a few years.

526
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,930
I met your father
at that teacher's house.

527
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,560
Your father

528
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,560
showed us many pictures

529
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,800
of you as a child.

530
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
Even though it's been so many years,

531
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,280
I feel like

532
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,280
you haven't changed much.

533
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,560
I thought you looked familiar

534
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,760
the first time
I saw you in the bookstore.

535
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,320
I bumped into you again
in the colouring class.

536
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,970
So I asked my junior

537
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,410
to look up the list of
new students in the art department.

538
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,890
When I saw your name,
I was sure it was you.

539
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,760
Your father was my idol.

540
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,850
So I was really surprised

541
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,930
to meet you at the campus.

542
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,690
I may have been

543
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,240
a bit overzealous,

544
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,320
- So...
- No.

545
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,130
I overthought it.

546
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,690
You are

547
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
a very wary person.

548
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,280
What are you laughing at?

549
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,760
Well,

550
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,610
I just thought of a phrase.

551
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,170
What phrase?

552
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,970
The wheel of fortune turns.

553
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,320
What

554
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,970
does that mean?

555
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,480
I

556
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,080
suddenly thought of
something from the past.

557
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,930
Just an afterthought
to express my feelings.

558
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,760
Why are you following me?

559
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,800
Do you want to send me home?

560
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,760
No.

561
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,210
It's inappropriate.

562
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,930
Why are you backing away?

563
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,410
Didn't you say it was
a misunderstanding?

564
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,520
Yes,

565
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,970
it was a misunderstanding.

566
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,080
But the way you just asked me

567
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,170
made me nervous.

568
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,040
Okay, you don't have to send me.

569
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,450
Give me the keys.

570
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,210
Why? Did you decide to rent again?

571
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,080
Since it was a misunderstanding,

572
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,080
I don't have to worry about the house.

573
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,370
I can offer you a cheaper rent.

574
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,520
No, I don't like

575
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,320
taking advantage of people.

576
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,560
Okay. Up to you.

577
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,320
I will pay the rent

578
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,000
to your account regularly.

579
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,080
That's it.

580
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,720
Wait.

581
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,890
What now?

582
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,800
One more thing.

583
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,690
I wonder if you are interested

584
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,890
to join our art club.

585
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm graduating

586
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
and you can take
my position as president.

587
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,720
Your level is far above mine.

588
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
You're definitely up to the task.

589
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,850
No, I'm not interested.

590
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,650
Our art club has many
great social activities.

591
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,970
We often go on

592
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
outings, sketching and so on.

593
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,850
We also hold regular

594
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,080
charity exhibitions

595
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,930
and have auctions of finished paintings,

596
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,240
which are all painted
by our members themselves.

597
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,240
All proceeds

598
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,720
will be used to buy new
painting tools and books

599
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,320
to donate to
the students in the orphanage.

600
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,410
This activity has been
running for three years now

601
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
and it's very meaningful.

602
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,000
How about this?

603
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,210
Give me the bank account.

604
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,480
I'll donate some money, too.

605
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,210
No, I...

606
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,410
I didn't mean that.

607
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,480
We don't need money.

608
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,080
Then what do you want me to do?

609
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,650
If it's convenient,

610
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,370
I'd like you to

611
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,320
provide a few finished
paintings for the exhibition.

612
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,970
Our exhibition will be

613
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,450
a great success with your paintings.

614
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
You flatter me.

615
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,280
How can I be compared to my father?

616
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,370
But if you want me to help,

617
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,280
no problem.

618
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,240
I happen to have

619
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,720
a few paintings at my place.

620
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,040
I can provide them to you.

621
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,760
If anyone wants to buy it,

622
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,690
you can do some good with the proceeds.

623
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,370
Okay?

624
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,130
Okay.

625
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,760
It's a deal then.

626
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,240
It's a deal.

627
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,280
I'll get going now.

628
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,280
Okay.

629
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,370
See you next time.

630
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,210
Goodbye.

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,890
He Ran.

632
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,690
You didn't return yesterday.

633
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,370
The mailroom lady downstairs said

634
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,690
that some art students came

635
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,890
to pick up some paintings,

636
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,650
saying that it was already agreed.

637
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,610
I tried to call you
but couldn't get through.

638
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,170
They said the exhibition starts today

639
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,450
and they were in a hurry.

640
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,280
I saw a couple of wrapped ones

641
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,930
next to your desk

642
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,720
and thought those must be the ones.

643
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,040
So I took them down to them.

644
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,970
No problem, right?

645
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,280
No problem. Thank you.

646
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
Great. No trouble at all.

647
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,480
Also,

648
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,650
are you really going to
rent a house outside?

649
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,850
Are you sure you don't
want to stay in the dorm?

650
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,480
Could it be that we are too noisy

651
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
and affect your rest?

652
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,080
No, I don't have a routine.

653
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,210
I'm used to living alone.

654
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,130
I see.

655
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,650
I thought it was because
you were annoyed with us.

656
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,450
By the way, are you moving out today?

657
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,930
One more thing.

658
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,080
There was a painting
on the top of that shelf.

659
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,280
It was unpacked.

660
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,560
I took it down to them as well.

661
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,000
It looked like

662
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,930
a flower.

663
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,450
Yes, it was a flower.

664
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,040
He Ran, what's wrong?

665
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,170
Did I take it wrong?

666
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,370
Not that painting.

667
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,890
I'm sorry.

668
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,930
I...

669
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,650
Oh, no.

670
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,320
Sorry.

671
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,320
The number you've dialled...

672
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,720
Take a look.

673
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,480
(The basketball club is recruiting)
This is our brochure.

674
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
(The basketball club is recruiting)
Where is the charity art exhibition?

675
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,060
(The basketball club is recruiting)
It's over there.

676
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,450
It's over there.

677
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,320
Okay, thank you.

678
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,720
No problem.

679
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,170
Sorry.

680
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,650
The number you've dialled
is currently unavailable.

681
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,000
It's a mistake. There is a painting
that cannot be exhibited.

682
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,170
Okay.

683
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,170
What happened yesterday was our mistake.

684
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,970
I apologise on behalf of them.

685
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,970
It's okay.

686
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,610
A friend at the gallery told me

687
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,080
that this painting was
picked up on the day of the exhibition.

688
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,130
Are you willing to sell it?

689
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,130
No.

690
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,370
If you're open to it,

691
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,370
he's willing to pay more.

692
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,410
It is priceless in my heart.

693
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,410
Did you paint

694
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,970
Xiaozhou village?

695
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,650
How do you know Xiaozhou Village?

696
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,280
If I'm not mistaken,

697
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,560
I believe the place painted

698
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,040
is the garden in the central lake.

699
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,560
Yes.

700
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,210

You'll meet a better woman.

Han Yu!

740
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,170
- This place is so generous.
- Han Yu.

741
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,170
The stage set-up for
this fan appreciation event

742
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,560
is so classy.

743
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,320
These are all real trees and flowers.

744
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,720
No wonder it smells like a forest.

745
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,560
Have we

746
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
met before?

747
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,120
You must be mistaken.

748
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,040
Wait.

749
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,160
Xiaozhou Village,

750
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,770
right?

751
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,040
You are a relative of the little girl.

752
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,040
I sent her home.

753
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,000
What a coincidence.

754
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,560
I can smell the forest

755
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
every time I run into you.

756
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,120
You are

757
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,080
a man of few words.

758
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,000
What about the little girl?

759
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,410
Is she still living at your house?

760
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
She's back at her hometown.

761
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,850
Hometown?

762
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,370
Where is her hometown?

763
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,080
Yu.

764
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,810
Don't disturb him. Let's go.

765
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,250
The event...

766
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm sorry.

767
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,370
I've been working in Xijing
for the past six months

768
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,410
and I've just returned to Qiongzhou.

769
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,290
I ran into you as soon as I got back.

770
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,200
I guess we're fated.

771
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,290
I...

772
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,600
The goddess is here.

773
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,290
- Really?
- Yes.

774
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,200
Yes.

775
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,330
Are you free later?

776
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,770
If you are free, join us.

777
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,730
We have an appreciation event here.

778
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,810
It will be

779
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,120
a great show.

780
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,810
We also have good food and drink.

781
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,040
Come and join us.

782
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,520
Yu.

783
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,520
He is quite handsome.

784
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,730
Really?

785
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
He's just a gardener.

786
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,000
He has an aura, you know.

787
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,450
This kind of guy will
definitely attract girls.

788
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,450
I'm serious.

789
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,040
- Really.
- No way.

790
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,250
The goddess is here.

791
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,040
- Really?
- Yes.

792
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,160
Congratulations.

793
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,680
You found your child.

Wait for me.

797
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,680
Gerberas bloom late.

798
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,600
When they bloom, the other flowers fade.
