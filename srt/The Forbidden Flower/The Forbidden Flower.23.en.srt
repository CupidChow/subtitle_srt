=Episode 23=

3
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,580
Come on. Let me introduce everyone.

4
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,450
My best friend, Xiao Han.

5
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,730
I thought only Xiaoli is here.

6
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,250
I didn't expect her to be here.

7
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,010
No worries.

8
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,690
No, listen to me.

9
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,890
I said, no worries.

10
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,330
No worries.

11
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,730
Come and sit down, Xiao Han.

12
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,330
Sit there.

13
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,650
He's the florist owner.

14
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,610
What?

15
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,090
Everyone is here.

16
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,130
Let's eat.

17
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,730
Let's eat.

18
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,330
Why are you here again?

19
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,370
You're the guy from Xiaozhou Village?

20
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,050
You've met him before?

21
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,010
Yes, a few times.

22
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,850
So, you've met him before,

23
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,210
but you don't know who he is.

24
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,770
What? Who is he?

25
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,690
He's nobody.

26
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,930
He's the guy He Ran likes, right?

27
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,770
I got it.

28
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,010
Poor Han Yu.

29
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,690
But, it just gets
more and more interesting.

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,410
Fill the glass with wine.

31
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,290
Let's eat.

32
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,530
Come on, everyone. Start eating.

33
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,130
My brother, Zhang Yuanqi, has graduated

34
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,450
as a master today.

35
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,890
As his sister,

36
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,290
I'll toast to everyone first.

37
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,530
You can drink as much as you want.

38
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,650
You children can drink lesser.

39
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,690
Fatty,

40
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,330
you can drink a lot.

41
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,330
Drink with me.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,010
Sure.

43
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,970
We haven't met for half a year.

44
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,410
I missed you.

45
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,690
I missed you too. Cheers.

46
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,850
He Ran.

47
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,290
What would you like to eat?
Let me help you.

48
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,490
No need. I have hands.

49
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,890
The table is huge and my hands are long.

50
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,490
It's okay. I won't eat that dish
if I can't reach it.

51
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,410
The shrimp is nice. Taste it.

52
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,290
Drink more.

53
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,170
Thank you.

54
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,170
Put it there. Here.

55
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,730
Why...

56
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,090
Why are you looking at me?

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,570
Just chopsticks dropped.

58
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,850
It's not a big deal.

59
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,930
Hello, waitress.

60
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,010
Give me another pair of chopsticks.

61
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,210
Okay.

62
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,930
It's not a big deal. Let's eat.

63
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,850
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

64
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,490
The fish is tender. Taste it.

65
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,530
What are you doing?

66
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,010
Can you stop causing trouble,
Ding Xiaoran?

67
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,050
They're close.

68
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,200
We don't know them.

69
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,410
You'll be suffering.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,690
It's okay. I'm not afraid of her.

71
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,090
Cheers.

72
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,250
The tofu is fresh. Taste it.

73
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,330
Really? Come on.

74
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:27,930
Right?

75
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,090
It's tasty.

76
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,570
Come on, everyone.  Grab some.

77
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,170
You've found a nice restaurant.

78
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,970
Of course. Look at what I'm doing.

79
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,530
Children, eat more.

80
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,250
If the food is not enough,

81
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,010
- I'll order more.
- Yes.

82
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,730
Big boss.

83
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,090
Xiao Han.

84
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,290
Eat some dishes.

85
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,330
Go ahead first.

86
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,130
Come on. Eat while it's warm.

87
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,170
I'll finish it very quickly. Come on.

88
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,970
He Ran, take some dishes for Xiao Han.

89
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,970
Okay.

90
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,010
Who took this for me?

91
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,850
I must do that.

92
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,330
Let go.

93
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,650
No.

94
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,970
I said, let go.

95
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,010
I said, no.

96
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,850
The pine nuts and sweet corns
are crispy.

97
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,090
Let's eat.

98
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,490
Well, today's

99
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,050
a good day for the best student.

100
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,610
Come on.

101
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,770
Let me toast to you.

102
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,770
Best student.

103
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,930
Our brother.

104
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,490
Yes.

105
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,690
What's your name?

106
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,570
Zhang Yuanqi.

107
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,690
Great.

108
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,770
Are you going back to Qiongzhou

109
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,850
or staying in Xijing
after the graduation?

110
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,010
I'll go back to Qiongzhou.

111
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,450
Qiongzhou is great.

112
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,050
Yes.

113
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,810
I'm satisfied with my internship.

114
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,530
I hope that I can work there

115
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,850
after the graduation.

116
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,690
You're contributing

117
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,010
to Qiongzhou.

118
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,560
Thank you for the meal, Fatty.

119
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,650
Don't mention.

120
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,050
Yuanqi, he's like your brother.

121
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,810
I'll finish the wine.

122
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,730
You can drink as much as you want.

123
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,210
Don't let us drink alone.

124
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,770
Pour some wine for the children.

125
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,570
Come on, everyone.

126
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,650
Come on, I'll pour wine for everyone.

127
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,890
He Ran, I'll pour some for you

128
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,330
He Ran doesn't drink.

129
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,690
Don't worry, handsome.

130
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,250
This wine is not strong.

131
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,650
It's okay to drink a little.

132
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,650
Also,

133
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,370
we're close to He Ran,

134
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,010
right? There's nothing to worry about.

135
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,010
If you're drunk,

136
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,730
I'll send each of you

137
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,050
home safely, okay?

138
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,290
- Okay!
- Come on!

139
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,370
She can't drink it still.

140
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,570
Are you He Ran's boyfriend?

141
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,010
What does it have to do with you

142
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,690
if I'm her boyfriend or not?

143
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,690
You're not her boyfriend.

144
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,010
Why are you being so nosy?

145
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,650
That's my business.

146
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,370
- It's none of your business.
- Really?

147
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,210
I wonder if someone else
thinks the same.

148
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,490
Someone...

149
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,130
Someone else?

150
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,450
Who are you talking about?

151
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,170
You're not happy?

152
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,890
It's really not me.

153
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,290
Well.

154
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,490
It's me.

155
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,290
Let go.

156
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,330
No.

157
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,250
- Let go of your hand.
- We've been talking.

158
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,130
Come. Cheers.

159
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,170
Well, I suggest

160
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,690
all of us to raise our glasses.

161
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,370
We'll finish the drink
for good luck, okay?

162
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,850
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

163
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,850
I said, let go!

164
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,650
I said, no!

00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,850
(You should have a life of yourself.)

347
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,060
Hi, ma'am.

348
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,900
Someone asked me to give you this.

349
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,180
Thank you.

350
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,500
(I'll keep waiting for you)

351
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,540
(until the day)

352
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,220
(you want to become a woman again.)

353
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,940
(I'll keep waiting for you until the day
you want to become a woman again.)

354
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,210
Okay.

355
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,080
I'll listen to you.

356
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,000
When you're recovered,

357
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,130
I'll live my own life.

358
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,280
That's it.

359
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,170
(Okay.)

360
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,000
(I'm hanging up.)

361
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,080

395
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,020
I watched

396
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,370
her grow up.

397
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
She's stubborn.

398
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,650
It's not easy for you.

399
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,080
Is she sick?

400
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,040
Yes.

401
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,040
Cancer?

402
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,970
Leukemia.

403
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,650
How long has it been?

404
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,280
She was diagnosed with it

405
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,210
when she was 16.

406
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,180
Everybody thought that

407
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,700
she can't make it.

408
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,480
But her mother didn't give up.

409
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,800
She insisted on doing chemotherapy
for two years.

410
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,170
She's managed to save her life.

411
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,480
Ranran is

412
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,040
really strong.

413
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,690
Her will to live on is strong.

414
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,850
No normal people can handle the pain.

415
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,040
Her father had the same sickness.

416
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,280
He's committed suicide
on the second year he's diagnosed.

417
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
He was my best friends for many years.

418
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,720
He was also a very famous painter.

419
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,890
Is she having a relapse?

420
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,410
Yes.

421
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
All of us feel sorry for that.

422
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,890
Thank you for telling me this.

423
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,480
Will you leave her?

424
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,000
No.

425
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,130
I'll never leave her.

426
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,740

(Unknown number)

436
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,660
Hello.

437
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,560
(Hello.)

438
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
(I'm Xiao Han.)

439
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,170
Hello.

440
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,720
Mr. Xiao.

441
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,450
(To be honest,)

442
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,450
(I've got someone to check on you.)

443
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,040
(Mr. Han stopped it.)

444
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,320
I know.

445
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,760
I've been looking for a chance

446
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,850
to meet you in person.

447
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,800
When you're back in the country,

448
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,410
I'll pick you up.

449
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,690
Actually,

450
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,370
I'm quite curious.

451
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,040
I wonder why my daughter

452
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,410
likes you so much.

453
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,540
I don't know

454
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,970
how to answer your question.

455
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,040
But,

456
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,560
I believe this.

457
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,760
My daughter is good with her judgement.

458
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,930
I believe her.

459
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,800
Let me take care of her.

460
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,560
You...

461
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,320
You've found out?

462
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,890
Mr. Han told you that?

463
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,690
Let me take care of her from now on.

464
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,690
Please believe me once.

465
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,140
I have a class later.

466
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,370
I'll wait for you.

467
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,610
Forget it. I have no class.

468
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,410
Do you have anything to say?

469
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,000
I'll leave if there's nothing to say.

470
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,890
Let's get back together.

471
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,560
If you're telling me this

472
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,240
because of what happened that night,

473
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,850
I actually think
there's no need for that.

474
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,890
Xiao Han.

475
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,520
We're adults.

476
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,130
We don't have to do this.

477
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,130
I'm not telling you this

478
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,080
for any other reasons.

479
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,040
It's because I love you.

480
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,650
I'm here to look for you today

481
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,210
to tell you that

482
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,850
no matter what happens,

483
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,760
I'll never leave you.

484
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,850
I don't believe that.

485
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,760
I don't believe anything
that you've just said.

486
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,720
You can believe me

487
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,760
because I've come to Xijing.

488
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,210
I was there at the hospital.

489
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,290
I was there at the flower shop next to your campus.

490
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,770
None of those were coincidences.

491
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,850
I came here for you.

492
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,290
You've left again
without saying goodbye.

493
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,450
I've planned to never go back to
Xiaozhou Village.

494
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,680
But on the day I was moving,

495
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,330
I saw the words you've written

496
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,730
on the T-shirt.

497
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,480
He Ran.

498
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,370
You know I understand

499
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,730
every word written on the T-shirt.

500
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,810
I really don't know
what I should do with you

501
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,370
because I love you.

502
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,160
I love you very much.

503
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,850
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,250
I was walking on the street one day.

505
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,890
I passed by a fish stall.

506
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,040
I saw a fish

507
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,850
with calcification in its tail.

508
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,080
The owner wanted to sell it
at a lower price.

509
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,560
If nobody buys it,

510
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,890
he will throw it away.

511
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
What happened then?

512
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,120
I bought it with the original price.

513
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,680
I insist on applying medicine
for it every day.

514
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,480
I want to treat it until it's recovered.

515
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,810
I want it to be as happy
as it used to be.

516
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,330
Xiao Han.

517
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,850
You're a very, very

518
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,560
gentle and kind person.

519
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,040
God will help you.

520
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,770
God has helped me.

521
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,520
God has helped me find my beloved woman.

522
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,520
But,

523
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,480
I still don't want

524
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,600
to agree so easily.

525
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,770
Why?

526
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,080
Because

527
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,160
I was the one who pursued you.

528
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,250
I had to do so much

529
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:09,930
in the past

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,880
to make you love me.

531
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,080
Why would I just agree

532
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,780
just because

533
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,730
you have simply said something?

534
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,330
This is unfair.

535
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,680
I didn't just simply say something.

536
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,640
It's my first time

537
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,450
saying this to a girl.

538
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,250
