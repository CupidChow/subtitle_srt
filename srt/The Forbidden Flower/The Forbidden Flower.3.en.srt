00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,170
(Dongfeng Studio)
Look who's here.

5
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,170
(Dongfeng Studio)
Principal Luo.

6
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,760
Have a seat.

7
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,530
I actually

8
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
came here to teach drawing.

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,890
Full time?

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,560
Part-time.

11
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,650
Just for one summer.

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,840
Any thoughts on the wage?

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,040
Any amount will do.

14
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,810
Well,

15
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,530
I have a small request.

16
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,400
Ms. He.

17
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,680
Ms. He.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Can you hire this model for
the next figure drawing class?

19
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,970
I'll do my best.

20
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,370
Okay, class dismissed.

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,560
Take a break.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,560
How do you feel? Tired?

23
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm fine.

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,400
The environment here is pretty good.

25
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,120
I didn't lie to you, did I?

26
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,000
By the way, a student just asked me

27
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,160
if you could still

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,370
be the model in the next class.

29
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,370
What's the difference?

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,680
You need to be undressed.

31
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,280
Forget it.

32
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,770
Are you going to work later?

33
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,560
I have to go home and pack my things

34
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,880
before catching the evening train.

35
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,000
I want to go back to my hometown.

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
How long are you going back for?

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,810
I don't know.

38
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,490
(He didn't even say goodbye.)

39
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,840
(Oh, no.)

40
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,810
(I have to go home now.)

41
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,540
(For rent. Haircutting,
perming and colouring.)

42
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,360
Who are you? Are you here
to rent a room?

43
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,010
Is Xiao Han here?

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,570
He went back to his hometown.

45
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,090
Will he come back?

46
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,920
How would I know?

47
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,690
I'm here to clean up the room.

48

What are you looking at? Thinking of me?

97
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,410
Wake up.

know how to knock?

You have wronged me.

100
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,170
You left the door open.

101
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,880
Besides, I did knock.

102
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,120
I knocked so hard that my hand
went numb, yet you never responded.

103
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,880
Get out. I don't want to talk to you.

104
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,210
What's going on?

105
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,600
We got along fine the other day.

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,330
I don't want to talk
to you now. Get out.

107
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,360
He Ran, are you angry?

108
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,690
Do you want to fight?

109
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,170
I'm telling you, I'm not afraid of you.

110
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,690
Bring it on.

111
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,210
What's the matter?
Are you having another fight?

112
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,640
Mother.

113
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,810
Why are you fighting again?

114
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,970
No such thing.

115
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,970
We aren't fighting.

116
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,930
Ranran.

117
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,480
Yu's family has opened a new restaurant.

118
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,360
Do you want to try it?

119
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,760
Ma'am Han said the food is delicious.

120
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Forget it. She doesn't care.

121
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,570
Sure, I'm hungry anyway.

122
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Great.

123
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,640
Get dressed and let Yu take you there.

124
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,690
Take her there.

125
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,760
Okay.

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,810
Why...

127
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,640
Enough. Get out.

128
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,810
What? My mother asked me to get changed.

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,090
It's not appropriate
for you to stay here.

130
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,450
Okay.

131
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,290
(Is the house leased yet?)

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,810
(I wonder if he's back yet.)

133
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,000
(I guess I'll take one last look.)

134
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,820
Hi.

135
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,760
You are back.

136
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,930
I was passing by the other day

137
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,760
and noticed a for-rent here.

138
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
Are you moving out?

139
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,050
No.

140
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,520
I still live here,

141
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,330
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)

142
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,760
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)
but the salon is closing.

143
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,220
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)

144
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,970
Is this painting important to you?

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
I bought this randomly a long time ago.

146
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,450
Do you like African daisy?

147
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,810
I know the person who painted it.

148
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,410
Do you know the meaning
behind this flower?

149
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,120
Defying the odds

150
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,450

151
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,000
Xiao.

152
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
Let's go!

153
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,210
We'll have a dinner party.

154
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,810
I guess I came at a bad time.

155
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,480
I should leave.

156
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,810
Let's go together.

157
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,760
Sure.

158
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,840
Stop chatting. Open the beers.

159
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,810
Okay. Here.

160
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,090
Come on.

161
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,090
Done.

162

163

00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,120
Cut the nonsense, will you?

173
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
My wife is busy in the kitchen.

174
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,640
Honey, let Man help you.

175
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,450
Go ahead.

176
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,120
You'll be in charge here.

177
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,050
Just leave it to me.

178
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,930
Sister, let me help you.

179
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,360
Don't mind her.

180
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,640
Today is your birthday.

181
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,290
He Ran is my guest.

182
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,050
Treat her well.

183
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,120
Have fun.

184
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,170
Come on, guys.

185
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,170
Enjoy.

186
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,170
Bottoms up.

187
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:27,930
Sit anywhere you like.

188
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,480
Come and sit here.

189
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,050
Eat up.

190
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,240
Feel free to order anything you want.

191
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,720
There's plenty of food.

192
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,760
You let me sit anywhere.

193
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,240
You can grab a drink there.

194
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,970
Fatty, I need a drink.

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Sure.

196
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,210
Here you go.

197
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,170
VIP seat.

198
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,090
It's a great opportunity.

199
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,240
Seize it.

200
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,600
Romantic couple.

201
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,810
What are you waiting for?

202
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,690
Sing a song for your girlfriend.

203
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,240
I'll leave you be.

204
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
Drink up. I'll go and greet them.

205
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,720
I can't open it.

206
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,840
Thank you.

207
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,880
Xiao Han, happy birthday.

208
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,600
I didn't know it was your birthday.

209
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,240
So I didn't prepare anything.

210
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,330
You can tell me

211
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,360
if there is anything you like.

212
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,170
I'll buy it for you.

213
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Can you draw the Monkey King?

214
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,810
The cartoon version?

215
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,840
Yes, I can.

216
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,640
Then draw me one as a gift.

217
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,810
Okay.

218
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,180
♪Meeting you, and I see you♪

Fei, take care.

231
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,040
Pan, goodbye.

232
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,720
Text me when you get home.

233
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,280
Okay.

234
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,970
Okay.

235
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,480
Fatty.

236
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,280
I left the house without my keys.

237
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,370
It's late

238
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,410
(Zhang: where are you, Ran? Come back soon.)
and the studio is closed.

239
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,650
Can you find a place for me

240
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,890
to stay for the night?

241
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,450
Sorry for the trouble.

242
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,890
What's wrong with you?

243
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,760
How could you leave without your keys?

244
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,610
It's so late

245
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,800
and cold.

246
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,690
What should I do?

247
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,970
If you don't mind,

248
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,850
there's a small utility room

249
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,480
in my wife's restaurant.

250
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,320
However, the utility room

251
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,480
is a little small,

252
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,520
dark,

253
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,760
cold and damp.

254
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,970
You might get a cold, a fever,

255
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,760
a runny nose or something
if you sleep in there overnight.

256
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,760
It's okay, though. You're not alone.

257
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,240
There are rats...

258
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,080
Look how frightened you are.

259
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,370
Or moths.

260
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,650
How about...

261
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,370
Xiao.

262
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,690
You can crash at Xiao's place.

263
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,480
Why are you all standing here?

264
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,800
Go inside and drink.

265
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,930
Be careful, Man.

266
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,610
Xiao, I haven't had enough.

267
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,320
Man, you drank too much.

268
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,080
Well,

269
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,370
I have a headache.

270
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,970
I'll call a taxi for Man.

271
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,040
You take good care of Ran.

272
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,080
Be careful.

273
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,320
Honey, I'm taking Man to the car.

274
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,170
Okay.

275
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,210
Xiao Han.

276
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,210
Can you

277
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,370
take me in for the night?

278
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,210
I can sleep on the sofa.

279
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,930
There are rats in my house, too.

280
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,240
Aren't you afraid?

281
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,610
Why should I be afraid?

282
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,040
Besides,

283
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,720
you have a cat at home.

284
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,610
Cats can catch rats.

285
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,480
Shall we go?

286
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,130
Kiddo.

287
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,610
I'm not a kid.

288
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,020
I'm 25 this year.

289
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,130
Let's go.

290
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,380
(HOTEL)

291
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,080
(Xiaoyeli Inn)

292
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,420
(Xiaoyeli Inn)
After midnight,

293
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,280
After midnight,

294
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,130
the hourly rate is
RMB10 higher. No bargaining.

295
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,870
Xiao.

296
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,460
I can't believe my eyes.

297
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,870
Why are you interested in

298
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,870
coming to my place at this hour?

299
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,750
Who is this?

300
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,220
A little sister I know.

301
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,790
Can I stay

302
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,110
at your place for the night?

303
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,940
No problem.

304
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,790
Thank you.

305
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,900
No problem. You are most welcome.

306
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,870
I'm flattered that
a handsome man like you

307
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,270
would ask for my help.

308
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,380
All right then.

309
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,980
You are really something, young lady.

310
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,070
It's the first time in years

311
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,310
that Xiao has brought a lady to me.

312
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,140
I have plenty of room here.
Big rooms are downstairs.

313
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,070
The upstairs rooms have
large windows and good view,

314
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,110
but there are many mosquitoes at night.

315
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,310
Where would you like to stay?

316
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,460
Either one.

317
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,900
Either one will do.

318
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,660
Are you sure?

319
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,140
Okay, second floor then.

320
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,380
I'll put the mosquito-repellent
incense on for you.

321
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,790
Thank you.

322
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,380
Such a sweet lady.

323
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,660
Let's go.

324
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,510
This way.

325
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,740
You are quite polite.

326
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,220
(Welcome)
You are quite polite.

327
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,700
(Welcome)

328
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,900
(Welcome)
I guess

329
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,180
(Welcome)

330
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
(Welcome)
you're still a student.

331
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,660
(Welcome)

332
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,750
No, I'm a teacher.

333
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,070
So you're an intellectual.

334
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,350
A lecturer?

335
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,700
No.

336
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,030
Then what do you teach?

337
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,900
I teach drawing.

338
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,510
That's even better. So you're an artist.

339
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,590
Then you and Xiao Han
are on the same page.

340
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,790
I heard people say

341
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,550
that Xiao Han is also...

342
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,420
Yes, a horticulturist.
A gardening artist.

343
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,940
It's also art anyway.

344
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,310
Do you know a lot about Xiao Han?

345
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,180
Not really.

346
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,620
Xiao Han is a very distant person

347
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,550
who has been in
Xiaozhou Village for years.

348
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,220
He doesn't interact

349
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,420
with us commoners.

350
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,550
I heard

351
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,270
all about him from Fatty.

352
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,420
So you like Xiao Han?

353
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,900
Do you like him?

354
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,620
Yes.

355
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,980
I've been courting him for years,

356
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,310
but he just ignores me.

357
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,030
I like him.

358
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,750
Let me tell you, not only me,

359
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,350
but all the women

360
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,590
in Xiaozhou Village,

361
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,270
have a crush on Xiao Han.

362
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,110
How about Man?

363
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,030
Man?

364
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,380
She is not as good as me.
What does she have?

365
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,980
All she has is the shabby salon

366
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,350
that her grandfather left her.

367
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,900
Her house location is
not good as mine, too.

368
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,870
Let me tell you.

369
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,140
Half of

370
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,660
the shops on this street
are rented from me.

371
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,310
I'm just so bored that I opened this inn

372
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,380
so I could have people over
for a chat once in a while.

373
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,750
You're not only a rich landlady,

374
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,420
but also beautiful.

375
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,070
Really? Am I pretty?

376
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,900
Yes, prettier than Man.

377
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,180
You are so sweet. Let's go in.

378
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,030
Wait here. I will bring some fruit

379
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,590
and let's talk about Xiao Han.

380
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,660
Okay, thank you.

381
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,310
See you later.

382
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,110
Bye.

383
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,660
I am prettier than Man.

384
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,110
That's for sure.

385
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,750
What are you drawing? Monkey?

386
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,110
Monkey King.

387
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
So it's Sun Wukong.

388
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,180
Why are you drawing this?

389
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,380
Is it for Xiao Han?

390
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,350
Yes.

391
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,460
Still, you shouldn't have
drawn Sun Wukong.

392
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,940
Draw Tang Sanzang instead.

393
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,350
You've got a point.

394
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,310
Right? You can draw

395
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,620
some pretty fairies on the side.

396
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,550
A lot of fairies.

397
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,980
That's it. I will help you.

398
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,220
I know what they look like. Here.

399
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,900
What do you think of my drawing?

400
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,180
Not bad.

401
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Are you free later?

402
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,350
Yes.

403
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,180
If you like it,

404
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,350
why don't you treat me to a nice meal?

405
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,270
Just here will be fine. You cook.

406
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,420
Xiao Li said

407
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,550
you are a good cook.

408
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,620
I would like to try it.

409
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,750
She has never eaten any food I cooked.

410
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,940
Fatty said the same thing.

411
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,550
He made it up.

412
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,420
I will know after I taste it.

413
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,750
What would you like to eat?

414
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,380
Anything light.

415
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,620
Thank you.

416
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,310
Eat up.

417
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,900
Xiao Li is right.

418
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,420
You are indeed a good cook.

419
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,590
Do you often cook?

420
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,900
Rarely.

421
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,870
Then I should eat more

422
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,900
because I don't know

423
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,110
when I'll get another chance.

424
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,700
What's wrong?

425
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,700
Nothing.

426
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,550
Xiao Han.

427
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
Let me give you another drawing.

428
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,310
What drawing?

429
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,940
A portrait

430
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,830
of you.

431
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,070
Forget it.

432
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,140
Are you scared?

433
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,940
Why should I be be scared?

434
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,180
You're afraid I'll make you ugly.

435
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,030
You think too much.

436
