3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,070
Tongtong.

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,590
Why is there no picture

5
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,040
of your uncle in your house?

6
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,400
What picture?

7
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,230
Like old photos of him

8
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,590
and his friends.

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
Do you mean childhood photos?

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,760
Also fine.

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
But I prefer when he's older.

12
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,480
There are some in the cupboard
in grandma's room.

13
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,150
Show them to me.

14
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,710
Here.

16
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
Is this all?

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
Is this your uncle?

18
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,240
This is too young.

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,710
I thought you wanted to see him
when he was this young.

20
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,630
That's what I see on TV.

21
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,280
TV? How is it on TV?

22
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,150
When they visit the home
of the person they like,

23
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,310
they will look at

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,750
their childhood photos or something.

25
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,080
Pictures of this age.

26
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,800
Tongtong.

27
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,150
You know your uncle

28
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,630
used to have a girlfriend, right?

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,910
I know.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
I want to see her picture.
Do you have it?

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,840
No.

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,910
Why?

33
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,120
Maybe grandma burned them all.

34
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,030
Didn't your uncle secretly

35
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,680
keep one or two of them for himself?

36
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,960
Are you jealous?

37
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,030
I'm not jealous. I'm just

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,190
curious. That's all.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,000
Maybe he has them in Qiongzhou.

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,960
You can look through it
when you go back.

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay.

42
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,240
Have you seen that lady?

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,030
I've seen her,

44
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,560
but I was too young

45
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,360
to remember what she looked like.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,630
Do you think she is pretty?

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
She's prettier than you.

48
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,560
How can you say she's prettier than me

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,680
when you don't even
remember what she looks like?

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,430
I trust my uncle's taste.

51
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,080
And I'm not your uncle's type?

52
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,680
Anyway, she's prettier than you.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
You are just like your little sister.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
All you do is pissing me off.

55
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,240
Why are you being so petty?

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,270
Is that lady very nice?

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,950
I don't know,

58
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,120
but I know she's very talented.

59
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,630
She's won many awards abroad and...

60
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,560
Stop.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,750
Keep embroidering your flower.

62
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll get going.

63
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Goodbye.

64
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,390
Goodbye.

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,390
What's wrong?

66
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,070
I've made up my mind.

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,190
I'll stay.

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Let's go back to Xiaozhou Village.

69
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,560
Let's go back to Xiaozhou Village.

70

Let's go back to Xiaozhou Village.

71
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,920
I also want to play billiards.

72
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,240
I don't know how to play it.

73
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
Seriously?

74
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,800
Teach me, please.

75
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,120
Watch your way.

76
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,360
Go home if you don't
know how to play it.

♪If you kiss me, kiss me♪

174
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,180

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,820
♪You will be mine, tonight♪

176
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,460
(I love you.)

177
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,270
Sorry, mother.

178
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,640
In future, I will
be sure to tell you in advance.

179
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,960
Where have you been?

180
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Chuanxi.

181
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,790
In Aba Tibetan,

182
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,550
there is a Qiang village.

183
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,160
I went there with friends.

184
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,440
You guys went on a trip
during the Lunar New Year

185
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
and their parents didn't
have a problem with it?

186
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,480
It's a Lunar New Year's trip.

187
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,680
It only makes sense
to go during Lunar New Year.

188
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,480
He Ran.

189
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,030
This is not like you.

190
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,200
You never joined

191
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,310
such group activities.

192
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,350
Actually,

193
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,640
I didn't want to go, either.

194
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,590
But

195
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,070
I was afraid they
would call me a misfit.

196
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,200
I...

197
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,790
I don't blame you, either.

198
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,070
Then I won't join them again.

199
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,030
No.

200
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,590
Ranran.

201
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,750
It's good to get together
with your classmates,

202
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
but you have to take care

203
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,030
when you're out there.

204
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,960
Our health...

205
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,680
Mrs. Qiu, Mr. Han and
his family are here.

206
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,440
I totally forgot.

207
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,720
They came to celebrate
Lunar New Year with us.

208
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,590
Hurry up.

209
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
Wash up and get changed.

210
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,720
Okay.

211
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,440
You didn't remind me.
I forgot about it.

212
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,270
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

213
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Why didn't Yu come?

214
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,240
Don't get me started.

215
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,000
He disappeared on
the first day of the New Year

216
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,550
and left for Tibet with his luggage,

217
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,510
saying it was a charity gig

218
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,160
organised by his band members.

219
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,350
He called me in the middle
of the night yesterday

220
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,750
and said that he was not coming back

221
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,070
and that he was going to Guizhou next.

222
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,550
He also said that
he wanted to travel all over

223
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,270
Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan.

224
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,350
He's too wild-hearted.

225
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,110
Boys are playful.

226
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,960
It's normal.

227
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,750
It's good to have a daughter

228
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,030
like Ranran

229
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,880
who stays home with her
mother for Lunar New Year.

230
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,790
By the way, Ranran,

231
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,960
do you have any plans

232
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,550
with your classmates
during the winter holidays?

233
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,830
I think it's good to stay in Qiongzhou.

234
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,160
Yes, that's good.

235
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,440
You are not in good health.

236
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,200
If you're travelling all over the place,
you can't keep up with

237
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,270
the climate and the temperature.

238
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,880
No one takes care of
your food and accommodation.

239
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,880
What if you are...

240
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,310
She's a grown-up.

241
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,680
It's good for them to explore more.

242
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,070
Yes, Jiarong.

243
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,480
Don't be too tense.

244
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,750
Relax.

245
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,510
Ranran is a grown-up.

246
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,880
Yes.

247
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,790
I also encourage her to go out more

248
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,830
and hang out with classmates.

249
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,680
Cheers, Ranran.

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,830
Come on, eat.

251
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,400
Uncle Han.

252
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,680
How is he doing?

253
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,440
Take it easy.

254
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,440
I didn't say I was against it.

255
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,440
I was

256
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,920
on an errand in
Xiaozhou Village the other day

257
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,720
and I saw you two.

258
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
I was the one who went to him first.

259
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,750
I'm serious this time.

260
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,960
I know.

261
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,400
I know you two are serious.

262
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,550
When I saw that painting

263
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,750
in Xiaozhou Village,

264
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,440
I knew you guys were serious.

265
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,960
Uncle Han, thank you

266
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,680
for always being there for me.

267
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,550
You're acting like a stranger.

268
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,720
This is your own choice.

269
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,830
None of us has the right to interfere.

270
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,400
I thought

271
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,920
you'd want me to be with Han

272
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,680
like my mother and the others.

273
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,510
I don't even like

274
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,830
this nephew of mine myself.

275
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,590
Isn't it normal that you don't like him?

276
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,640
Han Yu is pretty good.

277
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,270
What's good about him?

278
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,590
He's so childish.

279
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,270
You are more suited to a mature, stable

280
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,680
and responsible man.

281
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,200
Ranran.

282
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
Why aren't you up yet?

283
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,790
Breakfast is ready.

284
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm a little sleepy. I want to
sleep a little longer.

285
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,750
Okay.

286
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,400
Ranran.

287
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
I am very busy these days.

288
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,720
You must take care of yourself.

289
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,790
Okay, get some more sleep.

290
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,550
Okay.

291
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,830
Ranran.

292
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,920
If you want to go out
for a walk, go ahead.

293
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,550
Just inform Ma'am Zhang.

294
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,960
I think

295
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
I think it's good to get
together with your classmates.

296
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,200
Besides, you've grown up.

297
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,000
I was too tense before.

298
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,310
Anyway,

299
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,350
I just want you

300
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,880
to be happy.

301
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,790

Hi.

316
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,550
You came early today.

317
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,880
What, you've been assigned to develop

318
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,830
a new product?

319
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,960
No.

320
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,680
They didn't assign anything to me.

321
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,640
That's normal.

322
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,070
It's all a load of hard work.

323
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,030
More work, more mistakes.

324
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,920
It is nice to be free

325
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
and get paid for doing nothing

326
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,200
like you do.

327
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,440
Have you heard?

328
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,350
Dong Pengxiang got divorced

329
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,070
and she was dating

330
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,110
He Zijie from our company.

331
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,000
A while ago, her husband made a scene

332
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,960
in our office.

333
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,880
Really? That's serious.

334
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,070
How did I miss it?

335
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,310
It happened just last week.

336
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,240
Didn't you go home on leave last week?

337
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,310
What happened to your family?

338
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,750
It's nothing.

339
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,830
I went on a sightseeing trip
with my girlfriend.

340
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,440
Air tickets are cheap
during the off-season.

341
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,480
That's brilliant.

342
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,640
We have annual leave every year anyway.

343
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,680
Don't waste it.

344
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,880
Unlike me,

345
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,200
I still have to clock in
and out at work every day.

346
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,790
Maybe I should take some time off

347
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,830
and go out for a bit of fun.

348
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,750
Yes, I'll give you recommendations.

349
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,550
Okay.

350
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,310
You see, this is our travel plan.

351
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,270
It's 12pm.

352
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,550
I feel like I've been sitting here
for just a little while.

353
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,070
Indeed.

354
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,750
I also feel like you just
came here for a while.

355
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,720
There's a new fried
chicken place downstairs.

356
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,550
I hear it's good.

357
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,550
Why don't we try it?

358
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,880
Sure, let's go.

359
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,070
Come on. Join us.

360
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
You guys go ahead.

361
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,310
I have a weak stomach these days.

362
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,480
I can't eat fried food.

363
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,480
Fine, we'll get going.

364
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,720
Consumer preferences

365
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,960
and spending habits

366
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
are changing dramatically.

367
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,680
Since 2015,

368
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,790
71% of consumers

369
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,400
have cared about their health.

370
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,240
By 2017,

371
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,830
84% of consumers

372
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,880
will care more about their
health than ever before.

373
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,830
So, in terms of age distribution,

374
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,350
the group of consumers
between the ages of

375
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,200
22 and 55 is more interested in it.

376
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,720
Wang got an A in
the last quarter assessment.

377
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,640
Do you know that?

378
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,440
How did he get an A?

379
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,200
He comes late and
leaves early every day.

380
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,640
Don't be innocent.

381
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,030
Our company is all about...

382
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,240
He's the same.

383
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,110
Yes. What should we eat?

384
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,680
Fried chicken.

385
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,680
Fried chicken again?

386
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,510
Precise nutrition

387
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,790
will gradually become

388
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,830
a hot topic in
the nutritional health industry.

389
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,680
More than ever,

390
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,830
consumers want

391
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,790
a personalized food brand,

392
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,830
which is reassurance, taste,

393
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,110
cost-effective to
environmentally friendly.

394
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,640
We are all set for

395
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,070
a bigger market and space.

396
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,550
This is the next phase of our

397
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,160
research and development.

398
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,000
Okay.

399
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,640
That's it for today.

400
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,000
Meeting adjourned.

401
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,960
Mrs. Qiu.

402
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,110
For your information,

403
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,480
you'll have three
meetings this afternoon,

404
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,960
all at the supplier's company.

405
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
We'll leave around 2pm.

406
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,000
I get it.

407
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,590
Is there anything else?

408
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,440
Have you had lunch?

409
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,400
Do I need to order food for you?

410
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,030
No need. You may leave.

411
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,590
Okay.

412
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
(Utility Room)

413
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,440
I get it.

414
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,310
I'll leave in 15 minutes.
