=Episode 16=

3
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,770
He's the person in the painting.

4
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,930
He's my beloved.

5
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm jealous.

6
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,800
I have something for you.

7
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,490
Thank you.

8
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,170
I'll get going.

9
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,800
Don't miss me.

10
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,890
Go ahead.

11
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,640
Goodbye.

12
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,730
Isn't he going with you?

13
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,360
He still has work to do.

14
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,010
You are driving.

15
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,210
I need to go somewhere.

16
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Can you give me a lift?

17
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,010
Where are you going?

18
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Fangxin Road.

19
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,170
Well,

20
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,520
I happen to be delivering
a document there.

21
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,330
Let's go.

22
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,050
Okay.

23
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,050
Is he handsome?

24
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,170
Yes.

25
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,400
He's my boyfriend.

26
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,010
Wait.

27
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,640
What was that cousin trying to do?

28
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,890
He sent you home and gave you flowers.

29
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,770
He's challenging me.

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,930
Han Yu, you are so childish.

31
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,560
Can you be jealous of the right person?

32
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,730
What?

33
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,640
What do you mean?

34
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,890
I mean it was not him.

35
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,090
Who else could it be?

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,970
You don't know him even if I tell you.

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,880
Wait.

38
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,200
I know everyone.

39
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,560
You can take the flower if you like it.

40
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,440
Remember to give it to your aunt

41
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,120
when you see her.

42
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,090
No.

43
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,730
Why should I give it to her?

44
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,560
It's your aunt's birthday.
This is for her.

45
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,970
This...

46
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,240
So this flower is for my aunt.

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,880
Wait.

48
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,360
What is your relationship
with that cousin?

49
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,760
Why did he send you back?

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,530
We are just classmates.

51
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,050
He was just giving a lift.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,650
I don't need to report this to you

53
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,680
because we are not...

54
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,880
Okay.

55
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,850
Stop right there. I know

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
you don't like me.

57
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,850
I'm glad you know.
So keep it in mind.

58
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,930
If you have time, go find other girls.

59
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't waste your time on me.

60
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,240
I...

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,930
Aunt.

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
Ranran, you're here.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Come on, sit down.

64
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,410
Your mother is here, too.

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,680
Really?

66
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,410
Yes.

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,360
She said she just came back
from a business trip today.

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,170
She came straight here
without even going home.

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,320
I noticed that she didn't look well.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,170
Maybe she was too tired.

71
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,120
So I asked her to go
upstairs and rest for a while.

72
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,530
We'll call her

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,560
when the dinner is ready.

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,760
By the way,

75
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,040
happy birthday, aunt.

76
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,420
Thank you, Ranran.

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,490
Aunt.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,200
This is from her.

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,970
Ranran, you are so sweet.

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,560
The colour looks so refreshing.

81
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,960
This is homegrown flower.

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,440
Did you grow it?

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,650
Not me.

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,170
What flower is this? It's so pretty.

85
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,730
Green Paris.

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,320
A kind of longevity flower.

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,090
Ranran is so thoughtful.

88
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,170
You guys wait here.

89
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,880
I'll see if the dinner is ready.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,650
Hang out with Yu for a while.

91
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,560
I'll set this flower up.

92
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

93
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,050
Yu.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
Why don't you say something?

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm watching TV. Why should I talk?

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,880
Fine. Then keep your mouth shut.

97
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,850
He Ran, listen.

98
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm in a very bad mood right now.

99
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
Normal. It's impossible to
maintain a good mood every day.

100
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,090
I am in a very, very, very bad mood.

101
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,930
You gave flowers to my aunt,

102
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,050
why not to me?

103
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,360
It's your aunt's birthday,

104
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,120
not yours.

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,320
You didn't send me flowers
on my birthday either.

106
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,560
Don't make a fuss about it.

107
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,610
I'm serious, He Ran.

108
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,650
All the men out there are bad.

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,440
You don't know
because you're so innocent.

110
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,490
That cousin is not a nice guy.

111
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,730
I know.

112
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,650
Isn't that how they act
in martial arts movies?

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,240
Then why don't you believe it?

114
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,680
Who said I don't believe it?

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,660
I'm not going out with him.

116
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,650
You're the only one
who doesn't believe it.

117
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,420
(Qin Zao: See you tomorrow at
Huanpo Road, 2, Tifei Restaurant, okay?)

118
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,970
(I can't make it. Have other plans.)

119
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,170
The real world

120
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,800
is too cruel to me.

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,650
The world of martial arts is better.

122
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,050
What has the world of martial arts

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
taught you other than

124
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,800
that cousin is no good?

125
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,490
Brother-in-laws are no good either.

126
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,160
You see, now that her sister is dead,

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,610
she started to like her brother-in-law.

128
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,850
Ridiculous.

129
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,970
Exactly.

130
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,880
This is ridiculous.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,970
Yes!

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,530
You're finally on the right track.

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,170
(No problem. See you tomorrow.)

134
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
Ms. He, you look

135
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,050
quite young.

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,170
Just call me He Ran.

137
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,050
Okay.

138
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,480
How about I call you little sister?

139
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,800
That's what we call

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,850
people younger than us.

141
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,250
As you like.

142
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,250
Xiao Han told me about you.

143
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,530
Really?

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,530
What did he say?

145
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,960
Well,

146
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,600
He just said it straightforwardly.

147
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,650
He and your sister seemed to
have a very good relationship

148
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,930
and they shared the same interests.

149
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
They have developed

150
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,290
several new varieties of plants.

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
They thought they were going
to make it to the end,

152
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,080
but then

153
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,010
they had a disagreement

154
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,370
about their careers.

155
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,530
Xiao Han thought that
raising flowers and plants

156
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,600
was just a hobby,

157
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,080
but your sister

158
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,800
wanted to get some benefit from it.

159
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
She died

160
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,680
in an accident during a local riot

161
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,480
on her way to

162
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,080
competition abroad.

163
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,720
Xiao Han then gave
the prize money from the competition

164
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,560
and all his savings

165
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,480
to her only sister.

166
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,890
I heard that you went abroad

167
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,890
and got married.

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,370
Are you unhappy?

169
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,600
I got divorced two years ago.

170
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,010
That's why

171
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,410
I came back.

172
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,530
Planning to find another man?

173
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,720
No.

174
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,800
Men are unreliable.

175
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,930
Is Xiao Han the only reliable one?

176
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,170
I think you may have misunderstood.

177
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,890
This time,

178
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,770
I just

179
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,170
wanted to see how he was getting on.

180
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,770
Why do you suddenly care about him

181
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,130
after so many years of silence?

182
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't worry.

183
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,460
I will not interfere

184
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,370
with your romance.

185
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,290
So you're saying that

186
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,720
you'll do something

187
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,010
if I'm not here?

188
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,290
Tomorrow Xiao Han will
help me practice driving.

189
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,050
I have to go home early
to get some rest.

190
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,170
So I won't keep you company.

191
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,800
Bye.

192
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,370
I don't think he can make it tomorrow.

193
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:55,890
Hello

194
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,770
Why?

195
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,080
Because tomorrow is

196
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,700
the date of my sister's death.

197
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,720
Sorry.

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,170
I don't think Xiao Han

199
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,740
has the mood to practice with you.

200
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,130
Tomorrow is the date
of my sister's death.

201
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
I don't think Xiao Han

202
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,800
has the mood to practice with you.

203
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:09,260
(Qin Rui's grave)

204
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
(Qin Rui's grave)

205
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,770
Are you coming in?

206
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,050
The meeting starts in three minutes.

207
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,250
Aren't you coming?

208
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,050
You...

209
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,290
Sorry.

210
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,960
I just lost my footing.

211
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,890
Thank you.

212
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,960
Why?

213
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,200
About earlier.

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,930
What were you thinking?

215
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,890
About the garage.

216
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,840
I wasn't talking about that night.

217
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,560
Are you often so late?

218
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,320
Do you often go home so late?

219
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,840
Alone?

220
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,560
Yes.

221
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,050
Which question did you answer?

222
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,800
Going home late

223
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,320
or alone?

224
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,250
Alone.

225
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,440
Okay.

226
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,200
We are here.

227
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,700
(Barber)

228
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,170
Have you had breakfast?

229
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,250
No.

230
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Why are you at home?

231
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,410
Aren't you going anywhere today?

232
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,600
I agreed to practice
with you today, didn't I?

233
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,010
I thought you were busy today

234
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,290
and not in the mood to practice with me.

235
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,200
Did you meet

236
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,440
Qin Zao?

237
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,010
Silly.

238
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,370
Don't be upset about this.

239
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,890
That's the past.

240
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,170
Xiao Han.

241
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,570
Have you forgotten about her?

242
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,720
If I die one day...

243
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,520
Don't talk nonsense.

244
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,930
We have a long way to go.

245
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,040
We still have a long way to go.

246
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,200
However,

247
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,570
I occasionally

248
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,040
get a little worried.

249
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,520
Don't you want to enjoy life?

250
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,280
Most of the time, yes.

251
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,280
It's just that sometimes

252
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,890
I get a little worried.

253
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,090
Let's go.

254
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,090
Where to?

255
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,650
Take my worrying little friend

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
for a getaway.

257
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,930
How about this restaurant?

258
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,000
- Let's see.
- This one has a very high rating.

259
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,930
Have you tried it?

260
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,680
No.

261
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,480
Let me see the photos.

262
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,280
Why don't we try it?

263
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,000
Yuanqi, there is an authentic

264
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,850
Sichuan hotpot restaurant.

265
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,240
Why don't we go together after work?

266
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,890
It looks delicious.

267
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,960
I don't like spicy food.
You guys go ahead.

268
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,810
We can order slightly spicy.

269
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,370
- Mrs. Qiu.
- Mrs. Qiu.

270
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,760
Let's go elsewhere then.

271
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,680
How about Western food?

272
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,540
Let me see.

273
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,170
This restaurant serves light food.

274
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,440
Why don't we go to karaoke?

275
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,170
We can sing and eat in the karaoke.

276
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,170
How nice, isn't it?

277
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,930
You're right.

278
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,570
Karaoke? The one down
the street from my place

279
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,570
is very well decorated.
I've always wanted to go there.

280
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,090
Why don't we

281
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,240
get everyone together after work?

282
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:05,930
Sure.

283
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,000
You are handsome.

284
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,330
You must be a good singer.

285
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,330
I'll be working late
at the office tonight.

286
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,170
Go ahead. Don't wait for me.

287
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,520
All right.

288
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,090
Ms. Qin.

289
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,760
Come with me.

291
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,520

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960

to pick other people's leaves.

What are you eating?

Sunflower seed,

373
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,280
but it tastes so bad.

374
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,240
Look. It's small and dried out.

375
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,040
There is no kernel.

376
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,130
This is the seed of
Teddy Bear sunflowers.

377
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,170
It's not edible.

378
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,240
Seed?

379
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,370
But I just ate it.

380
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,330
Will I get poisoned?

381
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,570
CPR.

382
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
You need to throw it out,

383
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
not doing CPR.

384
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,480
Then,

385
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,720
I'll suck it in.

386
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,480
Do it yourself.

387
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,240
Okay, I won't eat then.

388
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,680
What did you just say?

389
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,650
Did you say the farmer
won't come back today?

390
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,570
So it's just

391
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,760
the two of us tonight.

392
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,090
Don't get too excited.

393
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,130
She said

394
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,960
she doesn't have anything to eat here.

395
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,410
So we might have to take care of

396
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,280
our own dinner.

397
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,200
We can just order takeaway.

398
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,890
This place is too far away for delivery.

399
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,650
But I'm starving.

400
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,890
This Teddy Bear

401
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,440
sunflower seed is not tasty at all.

402
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,760
Let's eat fish at night.

403
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,890
Really?

404
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,090
Where to get fish?

405
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,650
Let's go.

406
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,240
What is this?

407
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,520
I'll use it for fishing later.

408
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,720
You fish with it?

409
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Instead of worms,

410
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,370
how can you fish with grass?

411
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,330
This is called butterfly bush.

412
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,130
It is poisonous.

413
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,240
Look.

414
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,000
Mash it up.

415
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,440
Yes, mash it up.

416
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,650
Then we'll throw it in the river.

417
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,130
It can tranquilise
the fish in the river.

418
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,240
Amazing.

419
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,170
Xiao Han, they are floating.

420
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,090
Get the net.

421
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,200
Hurry up.

422
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,240
It only works for about
three to five minutes.

423
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,330
They will wake up later.

424
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,810
Be careful.

425
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,240
Is it heavy? Do you need my help?

426
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,930
No, I can carry it.

427
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,520
This is the first time
I fish in my life.

428
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,520
No, the first time I tranquilise a fish.

429
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,650
So I must carry it.

430
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,810
Walk carefully.

431
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,960
Are you okay?

432
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,850
That startled me.

433
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,700
- Luckily it didn't fall out far.
- Are you all right?

434
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm fine.

435
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,240
If it fell back into the pond,

436
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,440
our efforts would be ruined.

437
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,570
Let's go.

438
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,930
Mrs. Qiu.

439
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,810
Our partner, Mr. Wang, just called

440
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,930
to invite you to

441
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,410

442
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,370
Are you going?

443
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
Find an excuse for me to reject him.

444
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,610
Okay.

445
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,280
Luo.

446
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,240
Why don't you

447
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,000
go home early too?

448
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,060
Get off work early. You've been
working so hard lately.

449
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,410
Okay.

450
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,930

Wang.

452
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,680

Okay.

454
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760

455
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,680
