=Episode 4=

3
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,150
Where did you go?

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,190
Where's my mother?

5
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,550
Mrs. Qiu is on a business trip.

6
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,670
She won't be back these two days.

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,470
Did you tell my mother?

8
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,430
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

9
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,150
Where exactly did you go?

10
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,830
I'm going to call your mother.

11
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,950
What about you? Where have you been?

12
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,070
What are you talking about?

13
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,350
I work at home every day.

14
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,190
I've never left the neighbourhood.

15
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,270
Indeed.

16
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,590
You've never left the neighbourhood.

17
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,510
What are you trying to say?

18
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,550
Nothing.

19
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,470
I'm just curious.

20
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,060
Did roasted chicken

21
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,710
taste nice?

22
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,830
Is it as tasty as the rumour says?

23
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,310
You were taking an afternoon nap,

24
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,430
so I didn't disturb you.

25
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,590
It's okay.

26
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,070
I understand.

27
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,910
So,

28
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,910
can we just stay the way we are

29
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,710
and stay out of each other's business?

30
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,830
What do you think?

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,110
I...

32
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,830
Ma'am.

33
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,710
I'm tired.

34
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,510
I want to sleep.

35
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,270
You should go to bed, too.

36
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,310
Good night.

37
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,460
(Xiao Han)

38
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,670
(When are you off work?)

39
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,070
(See you at the beach later.)

40
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,270
Ma'am, good morning.

41
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,190
What are you cooking today?

42
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,620
I've stir-fried two vegetables

43
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,350
and boiled soup.

44
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,830
The weather is hot lately.

45
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm heaty.

46
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,180
Why don't we boil soup that

47
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,110
can reduce the heat?

48
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,830
When are you going out today?

49
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,910
I'm not going out anymore.

50
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,310
Really?

51
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,710
Yes.

52
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,590
That's a pity.

53
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,310
Are you really not going out anymore?

54
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,910
Yes.

55
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,510
But, I'm going out today.

56
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,630
Can you keep it a secret for me?

57
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,710
I think

58
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,470
the man next door is a nice guy.

59
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,390
He seems gentle.

60
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,230
Well, it's not easy

61
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,070
to find a soulmate

62
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,630
whom you can talk to

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,950
while working in a big city.

64
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,230
Otherwise, being alone is lonely.

65
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,990
My mother

66
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,870
is just too sensitive and nervous.

67
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,220
I'm feeling bored staying

68
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,030
at home every day.

69
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,670
So, I've found a part-time job

70
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,870
to teach children painting

71
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,110
in a studio.

72
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,790
Sometimes, I get too serious

73
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,150
and come home late.

74
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,110
So,

75
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,310
we should tolerate each other.

76
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,430
Don't tell my mother about this matter.

77
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,710
Ma'am, what do you say?

78
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,620

Xiao Han.

94
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,510
I've kept you waiting.

95
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,430
Is today

96
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,990
our formal dating?

97
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,790
Sir, please buy this flower.

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,510
She's dressing up today.

99
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,830
She might get angry if you don't buy it.

100
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,630
What's wrong?

101
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,830
Today, I met

102
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,390
your student on the road.

103
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,870
So?

104
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,110
They told me

105
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,270
their teacher is great.

106
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,710
She's just graduated

107
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,350
and is already teaching there.

108
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,940
She said their teacher

109
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,310
is only 20 years old.

110
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,710
Is that true?

111
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,310
Why did you lie to me?

112
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,510
Just forget about

113
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,870
what we said yesterday.

114
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,110
That's it.

115
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,790
(The first sign of true love.)

116
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,110
(Men would be scared.)

117
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,950
(Women would become daring.)

118
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,660
(The first sign of true love.)

119
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,260
(Men would be scared.)

120
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,900
(Women would become daring.)

121
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,430
Actually, artistes are emotional

122
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,710
and passionate.

123
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,270
American artiste

124
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,110
O'Keeffe once said this.

125
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,990
She said

126
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,870
she has lived a few lives.

127
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,030
Actually, she has been great

128
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,710
at arts since young,

129
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,140
but she had to quit school

130
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,870
because she was always sick

131
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,590
and she can't show others her talents.

132
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,190
Until then, she met

133
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,190
her husband,

134
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,430
Alfred.

135
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,550
When Alfred

136
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,750
first saw O'Keeffe's painting,

137
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,190
he was moved

138
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,710
and he described her painting with

139
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,740
the finest, purest,

140
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,830
and most sincere words.

141
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,270
Then, they met up

142
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,270
and O'Keeffe became

143
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,710
Alfred's model.

144
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,430
He took photos of her day and night.

145
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,510
For example,

146
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,870
her silent face,

147
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,310
concave clavicle,

148
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,590
and her thin hands.

149
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,830
The passionate relationship

150
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,990
has inspired

151
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,710
O'Keeffe's creation.

152
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,580
(Hairdressing)

153
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:40,990
Anything?

154
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,270
The portrait we drew the other day.

155
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,110
I'm giving you a frame.

156
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,630
It's late at night now.

157
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,470
You could've sent it over tomorrow

158
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,270
or asked me to take it from you.

159
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,670
It's okay. I was just around here.

160
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,270
How much is it?

161
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,230
No.

162
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,750
The dress I'm wearing today

163
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,510
has no pocket.

164
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,830
Why not you pay me using WeChat Pay?

165
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,230
Did you block me?

166
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,510
Xiao Han.

167
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,420
I apologise to you for

168
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,430
hiding things from you.

169
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,830
But, even though you've rejected me,

170
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,750
I still think

171
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,790
you're a nice guy.

172
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,150
You're thinking too much.

173
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,030
Go back early.

174
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,070
I'm leaving now.

175
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,070
Let's go.

176
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,670
Send me home.

177
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,470
It's too dark and dangerous outside.

178
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,710
I'm leaving now.

179
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,350
Watch out for the stairs.

180
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,310
Wait for me.

181
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,350
Where are you working lately?

182
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Do you want me to follow you?

183
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,030
Good friends should help each other.

184
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,070
We can earn money together.

185
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,750
Didn't I get some jobs for you before?

186
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,030
You need money?

187
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,190
Yes.

188
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,460
You don't know because

189
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,190
you're not painting.

190
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,140
The materials are expensive

191
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,990
and the consumption is high.

192
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,590
I need to buy a new batch lately.

193
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,190
I'm troubled.

194
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,900
I'll be going to Xiaozhou Village

195
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,710
to cut hair for the elderly.

196
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,750
I won't be earning much.

197
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,830
Sure, I'll be going with you.

198
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,030
We'll share the profit.

199
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,430
I'll give it all to you.

200
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:14,830
Come on.

201
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,790
Here you go.

202
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,790
Give it to me.

203
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,950

The bathroom is too small.

272
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:32,910
It's not convenient.

273

I'm a girl.

274

279
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,510
Your bathroom is so small.

280
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,870
There's not even a hook.

281
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,430
Where do you hook your clothes normally?

282
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,110
Do you just put it in the bathroom?

283
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,630
The clothes will get wet.

284
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,790
You might get sick if it's wet.

285

No.

295
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,430

296
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,150

Aren't you

299
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,270
afraid that I'd take it away?

300
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,510
Then?

301
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,070
What then?

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,430

303
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,030

the person who will get hurt

305
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,310
is you.

306
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,390
I'm not afraid.

307
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,310
I like you.

308
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,710
I just want to be with you.

309
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,870
I hope you're not just being impulsive.

310
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,550
It's because I need to be responsible

311
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,390
as soon as I accept your love.

312
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,670
If you're not sure about this,

313
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,150
don't come look for me anymore.

314
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,110
It's you.

315
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,670

323
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,670
How is Yuanyuan?

324
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,390
I haven't seen her in a while.

325
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,310
Yuanyuan...

326
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,870
Yuanyuan has passed away.

327
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,390
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

328

It's okay. Well...

329
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,910
It's been years. We actually...

330
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,910
We're fine with it now.

347
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,390
He Ran.

348
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,110
It's you.

349
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,150
What are you wearing?

350
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,350
I could barely recognise you.

351
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,510
What a coincidence.

352
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,750
What a coincidence?

353
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,270
We're fated to meet, don't you think so?

354
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,590
If you say so.

355
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,950
Who is that?

356
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,310
My friend's mother.

357
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,310
Why are you pointing at her?

358
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,470
Sorry.

359
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,710
Which friend?

360
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,540
Do I know your friend?

361
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,150
It's a guy or a girl?

362
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,670
What are you doing in Xiaozhou Village?

363
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,550
I...

364
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,030
My uncle is running

365
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,310
a new western restaurant here.

366
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:04,830
Have you forgotten?

367
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,990
I wanted to bring you there.

368
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,790
Sorry, sir. Excuse me.

369
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,550
I...

370
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,350
What's going on?

371
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,150
Why is everyone saying sorry to me?

372
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,860
Someone has stolen something

373
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,870
from your basket.

374
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,420
This child has just put

375
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:19,870
the painting materials

376
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,390
into her bag,

377
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,030
but she didn't pay at the counter.

378
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,470
The CCTV has captured it.

379
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,670
Well, you're bold.

380
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,110
You're so young yet

381
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,190
you stole something.

382
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:32,820
Let me tell you.

383
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,270
If I were your father...

384
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,070
Okay, I...

385
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,980
It has nothing to do with us.

386
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,710
We're leaving.

387
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,910
Call the police.

388
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,870
Let me check

389
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,420
if there's other thing

390
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,910
that you've stolen.

391
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,470
We'll wait for the police to come.

392
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,790
What?

393
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,550
This...

394
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,110
Hold on.

395
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,310
I'll pay for the painting materials.

396
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,550
Take it as a gift from me, okay?

397
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,950
No. Well...

398
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,950
This is not...

399
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,910
Since that's the reason,

400
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,830
I'll

401
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,870
just pay for her

402
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,670
and apologise.

403
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,910
We'll go back and educate her.

404
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,870
Is that okay?

405
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,790
Wait.

406
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,230
What are you doing?

407
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,110
Stay out of this.

408
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,510
No, do you even know her?

409
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,470
I know her.

410
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,270
Why didn't you tell me just now?

411
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,830
I just didn't recall.

412
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,110
Now, I remember. I know her.

413
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,150
Who is she then?

414
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,830
She's my relative friend's child.

415
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,030
Relative friend?

416
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,630
What friend? Boy or girl?

417
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,510
It's none of your business.

418
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,230
Okay.

419
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,230
You know her.

420
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,190
How much is it?

421
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,870
Okay.

422
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,430
Uncle.

423
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,750
Do you still want your money?

424
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,070
Yes!

425
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,590
I'll be there right away!

426
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,710
Okay.

427
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,430
I've paid for it.

428
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,190
I'm sorry. I...

429
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,790
I have something urgent on.

430
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,860
My uncle is furious.

431
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,590
I need to go back now.

432
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,430
I'm leaving now.

433
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,710
Bye.

434
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,670
Give it to me. Thank you.

435
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,710
Let's go.

436
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,340
Who are you?

437
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,350
Why did you say you know me?

438
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,590
I painted this Monkey King.

439
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,860
I don't know you,

440
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,950
