3
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Hey, Kid.

4
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,440
Do you still remember me?

5
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,080
No.

6
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,390
How can that be?

7
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,670
I am so handsome

8
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,190
that children will never forget me.

9
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,360
How can you not remember me?

10
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,160
How about this?

11
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,670
Let's order every course of dish on this menu.

12
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,800
We can't finish them.

13
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,000
It's okay. We can wrap it up.

14
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,390
Let me ask you something.

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,360
Have you

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,470
seen He Ran lately?

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,110
No.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,390
Okay.

19
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,720
Are you He Ran's boyfriend?

20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,190
Yes.

21
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,790
Well...

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,750
Not yet,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,880
but I will be.

24
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,240
So you're not.

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,790
Sooner or later.

26
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,030
Not necessarily.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,030
Come on.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,190
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,620
I treat you to dinner,

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
yet you don't wish me
happiness in my love life.

31
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,470
You little brat.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,840
It depends on fate.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,920
It can't be forced.

34
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,070
Okay, let me

35
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,680
talk you through it.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
Look at me.

37
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,120
I'm so handsome and talented,

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,750
right?

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,280
So He Ran would definitely like me.

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,880
Your eyes are too small.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,840
He Ran likes big eyes.

42
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,630
I have small eyes?

43
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,790
My eyes aren't small at all, okay?

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,310
This is called inner double eyelids.

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,920
When I glare, my eyes are
outer double eyelids.

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,440
Look.

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
See?

48
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,030
Even with big eyes and double eyelids,

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,680
there is still someone more handsome than you.

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,280
No way.

51
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,310
I've never seen one.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,840
He Ran has met one.

53
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,190
That's even impossible.

54
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,440
He Ran

55
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,190
has been cooped up in home
since she was a child.

56
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,590
She couldn't have seen any other man.

57
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,000
Why has she been stuck at home

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,310
since she was a child?

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,880
Because...

60
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,350
Wait.

61
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,680
Why do you ask so many questions?

62
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,000
You are such a busybody.

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,000
Hurry up and eat.

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,780
I'll send you home after you're done.

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,200
Do you know the address?

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,260
I don't want to eat this.

67
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,240
You have to.

68
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,910
You eat.

69
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,560
No.

70
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,400
Is it here?

71
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,720
There's a tree in the house.

72
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,840
Your home smells like the woods.

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
There are lots of flowers upstairs.

74
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,120
No wonder.

75
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,400
It's quite similar to my house.

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,440
This painting...

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
Hello.

78
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,150
Uncle.

79
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,120
Why did you leave the studio?

80
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,240
I happened to run into her.

81
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,500
It is not safe for a child
to be out on the street alone.

82
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,440
I felt pity for her.

83
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,630
So I gave her a lift.

84
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,120
She was hungry.

85
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,440
So I ordered her something to eat.

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,560
I packed up the leftover

87
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,630
and brought it here.

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,270
Who are you?

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,440
A caring person.

90
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,830
How much is it?

91
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,920
No need.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,680
You don't have to pay for it.

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
I've got things to do. I'll be off.

94
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,120
Remember to put in a good word for me.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,240
No problem.

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,390
You are the best.

97
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,950
You wandered about again.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,190
Xiao Han.

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,150
Sorry.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
Come in and wash up.

101
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,880
Okay.

102
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll prepare the hot water for you.

103
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,150
Thank you.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,150
My bad.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,000
I shouldn't have done that
to you. I apologise.

106
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,630
Come with me to the studio tomorrow.

107
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,310
I will teach you well.

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
It was Han Yu who sent me back.

109
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,390
Han Yu?

110
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,480
Why would he send you back?

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,270
Has he been here?

112
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,880
When?

113
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,880
Did he see Xiao Han?

114
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,920
Yes.

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,920
Is Han Yu the one Quanquan shouted at

116
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,000
in the street that day?

117
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,270
He is not He Ran's boyfriend.

118
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,920
I misunderstood.

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
Quanquan made it up.

120
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,150
He is not my boyfriend.

121
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,710
He's just a friend.

122
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,390
I'm serious.

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,120
Go and take a shower.

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,190
Okay.

125
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Anything else?

126
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,360
No.

127
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,800
Do you need me to pass you a shirt?

128
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,360
No need.

129
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,720
What are you hiding?

130
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,080
What else are you
hiding besides your age?

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,720
Quanquan, you go to sleep first.

132
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,780
It's time for you to go back.

133

134

He went back to his hometown

177
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,510
and sent that kid to school.

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,030
Didn't he tell you?

179
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,240
He didn't.

180
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,480
Did you have a fight?

181
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,150
No.

182
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,120
Did he ignore you?

183
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,550
Let me tell you.

184
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,030
Xiao Han

185
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,750
is just like that.

186
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,960
He doesn't like to talk,

187
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,670
especially to women.

188
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,620
Do as I say, be cheeky, girl.

189
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,140
He has kept a poker face on the outside,

190
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,880
but has a soft heart on the inside.

191
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,910
You are still too naive.

192
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,790
You can't be too direct
with a man like him.

193
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,750
You have to find a way around.

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,120
Find something that interests him.

195
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,360
For example?

196
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,740
Talk about flowers, grass and stuff.

197
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
Listen.

198
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,120
As they say, men fear
being pestered by women.

199
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,080
The more you have in common

200
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,360
and the more time you spend talking,

201
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,360
the stronger your
relationship will become.

202
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,550
It's enjoying itself.

203
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,240
You bring it food these days.

204
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,720
You can actually leave it alone.

205
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,510
It's very smart.

206
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,390
It can find its own food.

207
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,670
It's okay.

208
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,880
It's not troublesome to bring food.

209
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,840
But then again,

210
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,480
it is pretty loyal.

211
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,670
All these years,

212
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,790
it's been staying by Xiao Han's side.

213
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,240
If it were me,

214
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,670
I would have run away.

215
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,840
Cats are better than humans.

216
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,510
Talk about flowers, grass and stuff.

217
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,390
The more you have in common

218
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,670
and the more time you spend talking,

219
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,550
the stronger your
relationship will become.

220
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,790
He Ran.

221
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,600
He Ran?

222
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,630
It's not me. You're hallucinating
due to low blood sugar.

223
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,150
I ought to get going.

224
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Wait.

225
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,510
Let's talk nicely.

226
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,240
Why did you leave in such a short time?

227
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,630
She's here to see Mr. Han.

228
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,430
I told her

229
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,880
he is away on a business trip.

230
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,150
Why are you looking for my uncle?

231
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,360
You can talk to me.

232
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm much more reliable than my uncle.

233
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,320
Really?

234
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,080
Yes.

235
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,670
So may I ask you, do you know anything

236
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,550
about plants?

237
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,880
Plants?

238
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,880
You don't know, do you? I'm off.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,480
I know.

240
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
I know very well.

241
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,790
As they say,

242
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,720
like uncle, like nephew.

243
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,600
How about it?

244
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,630
These are my uncle's

245
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
precious treasures.

246
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,880
From ancient times to the present.

247
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,880
Of course, not all

248
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,480
plant information is available,

249
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,720
but this is one of a kind in China.

250
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,510
You're bluffing.

251
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,750
Next time you come,

252
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,550
let me know in advance.

253
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,960
You came so suddenly.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
I didn't even ready.

255
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,750
Okay?

256
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,510
So?

257
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,060
You can't understand it, can you?

258
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,550
I can't understand either.

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,790
Go ahead.

260
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,950
Hey, lady.

261
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,910
You can

262
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,950
just feign it.

263
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,360
Don't really get into it.

264
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,990
Do you think I'm like you?

265
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,430
Fine.

266
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,630
You are the best, okay?

267
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,520
What got into you all of a sudden?

268
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,950
What's with the sudden interest?

269
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,190
Because...

270
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,990
What is it?

271
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Because I want to.

272
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,560
Let me borrow these two books.

273
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,880
Please tell your uncle for me.

274
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,120
I'll return it after
I've finished reading it.

275
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,430
No, wait.

276
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,320
You just got here.

277
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,470
Why leaving so soon? Why don't you

278
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,430
stay a little longer?

279
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,280
I came to see your uncle.

280
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,080
Since he's not here, why should I stay?

281
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,710
Why are you so
interested in my uncle?

282
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,120
Pay more attention to me.

283
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,990
I can tell you

284
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,120
everything you want to know.

285
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,710
How about this?

286
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,320
Would you like to see

287
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,520
my uncle's plants?

288
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,430
Mr. Han.

289
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,560
Mr. Han.

290
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,950
Your uncle specifically instructed

291
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,280
that no one is allowed
to touch his potted plants.

292
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,280
Don't bother.

293
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,520
Am I an outsider? I'm his nephew.

294
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,950
He specified that

295
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,080
his nephews in particular

296
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,280
were not allowed to touch his potted plants.

297
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,190
So annoying.

298
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,120
I just want to show it to He Ran.

299
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,560
As long as you don't
tell my uncle, he won't know.

300
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:16,800
But...

301
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,710
You...

302
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,150
Here. What do you think?

303
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,230
This is the plant that
won the gold medal

304
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,990
for new varieties

305
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,630
at the European Flower
Contest a few years ago.

306
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,040
It's hard to find.

307
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,950
There should be only
ten pots in this world.

308
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,760
My uncle went through a lot of trouble

309
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,880
to get it back from abroad.

310
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
This is the only one

311
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,190
in the country.

312
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,800
This flower looks familiar.

313
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
I seem to have seen it somewhere.

314
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,470
Familiar?

315
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
Impossible.

316
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,560
My uncle said it is very valuable.

317
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,280
This leaf alone

318
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
is worth the price of a sport car.

319
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,430
I guess it's not the same.

320
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,760
Of course. Listen.

321
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,470
Don't always think

322
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,710
that all greenery is the same.

323
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,390
This is very rare.

324
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,800
It's an honour for you

325
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,360
to see it in my home.

326
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,040
If you have any plants

327
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,080
you would like to see...

328
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,470
Hey.

329
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,800
Why are you leaving?

330
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,280
I'll give you a lift.

331
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,950
No need. My driver is at the gate.

332
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,910
Please come more often.

333
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
We have many...

334
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,710
By the way,

335
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,360
we have a new horticulturist

336
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,990
and he is very good at gardening.

337
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,470
Mother.

338
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,360
You are back.

339
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,630
I'll stay with you. Just sleep.

340
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,390
Close your eyes.

341
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,630
I can't sleep

342
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,910
with you here, mother.

343
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,430
Then you sleep. I'm leaving.

344
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
Cover yourself up.

345
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,990
Ranran.

346
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,840
Why is this painting
hanging on the ceiling?

347
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,760
It's so inappropriate.

348
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,360
Mother, I like it there.

349
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,800
I can see it as soon as I open my eyes.

350
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,470
No.

351
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,760
I'll get you the best frame

352
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,950
and mount it tomorrow.

353
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,670
It is better placed
in the study on the third floor.

354
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,520
No need.

355
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,910
Don't worry, I'll make arrangements.

356
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,150
Mother, this is my room.

357
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
I know it's your room.

358
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,230
I'll get it done perfectly.

359
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,430
Go to sleep.

360
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,910
Here. Choose one.

361
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
Mother, what about this?

362
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,280
This is too plain.

363
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,710
This?

364
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,950
It looks like my dress.

365
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,840
No way.

366
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,150
What are all these?

367
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,120
I'll have ask Zhang
to throw them all away tomorrow.

368
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,600
Look at this.

369
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,800
What do you think?

370
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,390
Pretty.

371
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,600
Look. Your hair's a mess.

372
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,390
Let me comb it.

373
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,950
I'll make you look pretty.

374
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,670
Don't get

375
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
these two strands in the front.

376
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,120
Mother, let's do it at home.

377
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,040
You're like holding a knife

378
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,910
and stabbing me in the heart.

379
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,840
Ranran, can you trust me?

380
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,040
Ranran, don't ever leave me again.

381
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,880
Ranran.

382
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,600
Where are you going?

383
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,470
Why aren't you going to work?

384
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,560
I'm on leave.

385
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,430
I'll stay with you every day.
I won't go anywhere.

386
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,150
The pig liver is blood tonic.

387
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,600
Eat all of it.

388
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,190
Come on.

389
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,600
Ranran.

390
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,150
Ranran, what's wrong?

391
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,150
Your mother really cares about you.

392
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,150
She will call me at
every meal to remind me.

393
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,040
I've been too busy
to spend time with you.

394
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,150
You don't blame me, do you?

395
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,840
Mother.

396
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm fine.

397
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,840
Go to sleep.

398
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,760
I'm really fine.

399
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,990
I'm fine.

400
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,670
I'm fine.

401
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,190
Go to sleep.

402
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,320
Sleep tight.

403
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,230
Mrs. Qiu asked me to take it down.

404
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,080
Ranran.

405
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,670
Mother.

406
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,990
Here. Drink some soup.

407
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,880
This is to replenish energy and blood.
Drink it while it's hot.

408
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,760
Here.

409
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,910
Okay.

410
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,280
I have

411
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,040
seen you

412
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,950
staring at this garden lately.

413
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,950
Our garden

414
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,150
has been neglected for so long.

415
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,320
Should I get someone to manage it?

416
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,630
No need. It's troublesome.

417
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,120
Not at all.

418
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,230
I see you've been

419
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,600
reading all those floral
and plant magazines lately.

420
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,950
Are you into gardening?

421
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,710
I'm just checking it out.

422
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,430
You know what?

423
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,040
Mr. Han is an expert in this field.

424
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,150
Mrs. Han said

425
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,910
he's done a great job with their garden.

426
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,710
Should I get someone
to manage our garden?

427
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,710
Mother, just make the arrangements.

428
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,150
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,520
Also,

430
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
about your follow-up appointment today.

431
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,120
Should I

432
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,630
go with you?

433
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,230
Okay.

434
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,560
Mother.

435
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,880
Ranran.

436
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,080
Come here.

437
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,280
Look what Yu brought you.

438
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,150
Look.

439
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,670
Are you happy?

440
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,190
Are you happy, He Ran?

441
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,470
Now we can

442
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,710
go to Xijing together.

443
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,560
Will I be leaving next month?

444
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
Yes, classes start in September.

445
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,600
I have discussed it with Mrs. Han.

446
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,430
I'll go with you

447
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,760
and arrange everything for you

448
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,630
a week beforehand.

449
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,320
Then we can be relieved.

450
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,800
Uh...

451
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,600
He Ran, what's with that look?

452
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,080
What's wrong?

453
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,190
Are you sad to leave home?

454
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,150
Nothing.

455
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,040
I haven't slept well. I'm a bit dizzy.

456
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,560
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

457
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,800
Do you need to go to the hospital?

458
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,800
It's okay. I'll just take a break.

459
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,190
From now on, you should

460
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,630
drink a glass of milk every night

461
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,430
and finish it before
you go to sleep, okay?

462
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,190
Ma'am.

463
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,950
He Ran is not a child anymore.

464
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,630
Don't be so strict with her.

465
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,080
He Ran.

466
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,670
When we get to Xijing,

467
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,670
we can still hang out.

468
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,800
I'll take care of you.

469
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,280
Who says I'm leaving?

470
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,320
No, you said you wanted to go to Xijing.

471
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,470
You applied for it yourself.

472
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,040
How can you go back on your word

473
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,040
after one summer?

474
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,560
You...

475
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,560
Women are unpredictable.

476
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,390
You are so fickle.

477
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,560
Anyway,

478
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,320
I don't care.

479
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,840
I've asked my uncle to give me
a farewell party next week.

480
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,630
You must come.

481
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,080
I won't do it unless you go.

482
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,840
Okay. I'll take Ranran there

483
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,320
when the time comes.

484
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,620
(Letter of Acceptance)

485
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,520
Why didn't you find an excuse

486
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,880
to go out with Han Yu just now?

487
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,360
I have to leave sooner or later.

488
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,360
Ma'am.

489
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,520
Ma'am.

490
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,230
Why is there no water?

491
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,630
Ma'am.

492
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,080
We are out of water.

493
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,950
Okay, I'll call someone to bring water.

494
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,880
By the way, I...

495
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,390
(Next episode)

496
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,980

What are you hiding?

497
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,080
(Next episode)
On what basis

498
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,120
(Next episode)
do you expect me to answer it?

499
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,390
(Next episode)
Besides, aren't you hiding anything?

500
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,950
(Next episode)
Your past.

501
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,520
The whole Xiaozhou Village
doesn't know anything about you.

502
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,140
I will only

503
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,710
tell my boyfriend my secrets.
