How did it go?

00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:23,748
How was the battlefield today?

5
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:25,707
Don't mention it.

6
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:28,507
I was standing in front of
the coffee shop counter

7
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:29,867
for a whole day,

8
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:30,787
but

9
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,548
he didn't come to our coffee shop
to buy coffee.

10
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,828
He went to the coffee shop
on the next block.

11
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:37,988
I was so frustrated.

12
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,427
But I didn't give up.

13
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:43,388
I asked for permission and went there.

14
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,307
I was quite lucky.

15
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,147
The shop's business was quite good.

16
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,748
The line was long.

17
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,347
I happened to line up behind him.

18
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,188
I was watching his back.

19
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:54,908
I was so happy.

20
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:55,748
Wait a second.

21
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:57,188
You only watched him?

22
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:58,828
Why didn't you take the initiative

23
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,100
to say hi to him?

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,620
Why did you just hide behind him?

25
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,028
I was afraid.

26
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,548
If he doesn't remember who I am,

27
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:05,748
it's going to be embarrassing.

28
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,307
After all, we've just met once.

29
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:11,348
Also, I think that

30
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,788
watching him from behind

31
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,988
feels good.

32
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:16,508
Do you know that

33
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,187
his shoulders are super wide?

34
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:22,108
It looks really safe.

35
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:23,548
Standing next to him

36
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,108
makes me look tiny.

37
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:26,988
You?

38
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:29,707
You looked tiny?

39
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:32,307
Yes, I'm not tall.

40
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,187
Look.

41
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:34,668
My bones are small.

42
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:36,948
Look at He Ran.

43
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,268
Compare yourself with her.

44
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,508
He Ran looks skinny,

45
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:46,988
but she's not healthy.

46
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,068
Why are you talking like that?

47
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:51,948
Oh, yes.

48
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:53,548
The head of department told me that

49
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:55,348
He Ran took a break

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,920
because of her health.

51
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:58,187
So, the head of department asked us

52
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,268
to take care of her.

53
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:00,828
That's right.

54
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,668
No one likes to be called sick.

55
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:04,108
He Ran's changed a lot

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,980
after she came back.

57
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,747
I believe she's trying to
get along with us.

58
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,027
I got it.

How do I explain to you?

70
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,707
It's like having a tumour,

71
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,508
but it's not affecting
the fish's health.

72
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:05,587
Can it be treated?

73
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:07,668
Of course it can.

74
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:08,988
It's just troublesome.

00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:09,948
Think about it.

76
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,427
You have to remove
the calcification spots.

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,880
You also have to clean it.

78
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,340
You need to put fish medicine every day.

79
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,708
But it's no guarantee that it will heal.

80

84
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:25,348

it shouldn't be devaluated.

It looks like this fish.

133

Why did he buy a fish?

134
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:45,668
I don't know.

135

142
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:04,148

144
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:09,307

It's betta, isn't it?

162

I'm planning to keep a fish too.

163

Well,

164
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:42,708

00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:06,068
Take care.

174
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,547
Let's go, Ding Xiaoran.
Let's go for a meal.

175
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,387
I'm not going. I have no appetite.

176
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,389
That's odd.

177
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,667
What's happened? Are you sick?

178
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,108
She's missing someone.

179
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,188
The flower shop has been closed
for a few days.

180
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:36,188
The "closed temporarily" sign
has been hanging there.

181
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:40,468
I've looked in from the window
for a few times.

182
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,068
There's no one in there.

183
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,907
Will I not be able to see him again?

184
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:47,588
I don't think so.

185
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,588
Is he leaving without saying goodbye?

186
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,747
He is not leaving
without saying goodbye.

187
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:56,428
After all, we don't know each other.

188
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,147
All right. Stop thinking.

189
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,428
Come with us to a meal.

190
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,547
You don't even know his name

191
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:04,308
and you're crazy about him.

192
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:05,468
Do you need to go to that extend?

193
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,428
That's right. Let's go.

194
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:07,588
I'm not going.

195
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,108
I can't eat.

196
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:11,468
So sad.

197
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:13,027
He Ran, are you going?

198
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:14,228
I'm not going.

199
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,228
Then we're going now.

200
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:17,708
Bye bye.

201
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,507
He Ran.

202
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:25,188
Are you and your boyfriend okay?

203
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,507
I don't see him coming to visit you.

204
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:30,787
The person who visited me

205
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:31,828
is not my boyfriend.

206
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,667
I'm happy that he's not coming anymore.

207
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:36,267
I see.

208
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:37,988
What about your boyfriend?

209
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,108
My boyfriend?

210
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,308
He's not by my side.

211
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:46,828
Where is he then?

212
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,308
It's about the same as you.

213
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:56,828
He's not by my side anymore.

214
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,547
But,

215
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,787
the one who left without
saying goodbye was me.

216
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,108
I see.

217
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,468
How long have you not been seeing him?

218
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:11,907
How long?

219
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,547
It's been quite a while.

220
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:20,907
A few months.

221
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,948
Maybe half a year.

222
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:26,227
I don't remember anymore.

223
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:28,828
Half a year?

224
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,428
Would you have

225
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:31,867
forgotten how he looks?

226
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:35,867
Xiao Han.

227
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:39,907
Let me look at you.

228
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:48,308
Didn't you want to look at me?

229
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm not looking at you

230
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:53,907
with my eyes.

231
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:02,867
I'm looking at you with my heart.

232
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:07,988
You're here.

233
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:13,948
I'll keep you in my heart.

234
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:27,700
No.

235
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:32,468
How will I ever forget how he looks?

236
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,267
Unless I'm dead

237
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,068
one day

238
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,428
and my heart is not beating anymore.

239
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,948
Otherwise, I won't forget
about how he looks.

240
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:02,787
Yes, I suddenly remember that

241
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,108
I've taken his picture.

242
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:08,627
My cousin's coffee shop
was having an event.

243
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:10,228
I brought my SLR camera there

244
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:11,547
to take pictures for them.

245
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:16,108
Then I found him in the shop.

246
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:17,348
So I went in.

247
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:19,787
At that time,

248
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,627
he was staring blankly at the aquarium.

249
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,068
He didn't notice me at all.

250
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:26,027
So I took the camera

251
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,188
and took a picture of him.

252
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,068
But he's a nice person.

253
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,988
He found out that
I was taking his picture,

254
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,747
but he didn't ask me to delete it.

255
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:40,267
Do you want to take a look
at the picture?

256
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:41,828
Okay.

257
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,787
Thank you.

258
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,787
He Ran.

259
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:52,228
Actually,

260
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:54,588
I think you're a nice person.

261
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,068
Thank you

262
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:00,428
for the second part of your words.

263
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:04,708
He Ran, you know what?

264
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:05,428
Actually,

265
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,547
when I met you for the first time,

266
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,348
we were a little afraid of you.

267
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,387
You looked like
you don't talk to strangers

268
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:13,828
and you looked cold.

269
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,588
When I was talking to you,

270
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,108
you didn't really respond to me.

271
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:19,588
But,

272
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,907
after you came back this time,

273
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:22,907
you've become so gentle.

274
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:26,747
Look, you're even talking to me

275
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:27,948
and comforting me.

276
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:29,507
You even took my camera for me.

277
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:36,108
Found it.

278
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,188
This is the picture.

279
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:41,867
He Ran,

280
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:42,948
do you want to take a look?

281
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,867
No. You can enjoy it on your own.

282
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,787
Jingjing and Li Yun wanted to see it,

283
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:48,948
but I didn't let them see it.

284
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:51,147
I'm afraid they'll like him
and compete with me for him.

285
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:53,828
Are you not afraid that

286
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:55,147
I'll like him

287
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,667
and compete with you for him?

288
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:57,907
No.

289
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,867
I think

290
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,907
he's not your type

291
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,188
because

292
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,948
he's just an ordinary man.

293
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,428
But,

294
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,267
he's not that ordinary.

295
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:18,108
What you said makes me want
to look at it too.

296
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,588
What a shame.

297
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:26,708
I still don't know

298
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,267
his name.

299

301
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:53,988
Are you done looking at it?

302
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,588
Give it back to me.

303
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,188
That's the only picture I have.

304
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:58,507
Don't delete it accidentally.

305
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,747
I have yet to print it.

306
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:02,267
He Ran.

307
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:03,907
He Ran.

308
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:07,267
His name is Xiao Han.

309
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,747
What did you say?

310
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:11,948
I said,

311
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,860
his name is Xiao Han.

312
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,027
Do you know each other?

313
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:19,667
No.

314
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:22,267
How did you get to know his name?

315
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,267
By chance.

316
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,560
I heard his friend called him that.

317
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,747
You've been to that flower shop?

318
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,828
You're lucky.

319
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,387
I've been there many times

320
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:45,948
but I haven't heard any of his friends
calling him his name.

321
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:51,708
But

322
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,948
I think I'm quite lucky

323
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,428
to have met him.

324
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,667
Have you watched Casablanca?

325
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:02,108
There is a particularly classic line in it.

326
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,988
(There are so many cities in the world.)

327
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:07,668
(There are so many bars in the city.)

328
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,787

(There are so many flower shop

331
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,347
(But I went into his.)

332
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:25,267
He Ran,

333
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:26,908
don't you think I'm lucky?

334
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:34,188
I'm not sure about your luck.

335
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,228
I feel like I have really good luck.

336
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,107

♪That you'll come back♪

343
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,620
♪I can't stop loving you again♪

344
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,260
♪Loving you again♪

345
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:20,628
First of all, I want to order
100 green plants.

346
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:22,547
Then

347
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:24,628
I want him

348
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,628
to decorate the graduation ceremony.

349
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,587
The graduation ceremony team?

350
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:33,787
Isn't that the organisation department

351
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,267
and publicity department's job?

352
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:37,307
How did you get in there?

353
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,067
I have a hometown friend in
the publicity department.

354
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,307
We're close.

355
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:42,948
She's the vice president.

356
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:44,827
So this time,

357
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,668
I've requested to do the decoration
at the graduation ceremony

358
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,228
and the conference hall.

359
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:50,027
Decoration

360
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,228
takes a lot of flowers and plants.

361
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:55,347
Got it.

362
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:56,988
You're giving business to

363
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:57,908
your idol's flower shop.

364
00:18:58,747 --> 00:18:59,107
That's right.

365
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:00,908
I think she's just looking for an excuse

366
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,680
to approach him again.

367
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:05,107
That's true.

368
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:07,908
Love can really inspire
and motivate a person.

369
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:10,587
Look at Ding Xiaoran.

370
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:12,507
She's getting vigorous again.

371
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,267
She can eat and sleep now.

372
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:17,428
No way. I can't eat.

373
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:18,948
I'm losing weight, okay?

374
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,027
I just ate a cucumber
for dinner tonight.

375
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:23,827
Look. That's how hard she's trying.

376
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:26,027
She goes without food or drink
for the sake of love.

377
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:28,428
Where's the flower shop?

378
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,948
Where's the flower shop you mentioned?

379
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:33,988
Haven't you been there?

380
00:19:35,027 --> 00:19:35,668
I forgot.

381
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:39,107
Are you buying some flowers?

382
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,267
Yes.

383
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,507
But I don't know if it's far away.

384
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,027
If it's too far and inconvenient,
I won't go there.

385
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:45,908
It's not far and it's convenient.

386
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:46,988
It's nearby our campus.

387
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,307
Come with me tomorrow.

388
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:51,827
Buy a little more.
It would really help me out.

389
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:53,868
Okay.

390
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:04,787
Our conference hall is huge.

391
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:05,908
The graduation ceremony

392
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,908
is a huge event to our university.

393
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,708
We need a lot of flowers and plants

394
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,067
and our requirements are high,

395
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,640
but I've convinced them.

396
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,220
We'll get our supplies from you.

397
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:18,668
I'll be the person in charge

398
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,587
for the subsequent work.

399
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:22,347
Thank you.

400
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,188
You're welcome.

401
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:26,908
I'm happy that I'm able to do
something for you.

402
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:30,107
Well, my classmate wanted

403
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,347
to buy flowers here today.

404
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,988
She agreed to come yesterday,

405
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,507
but she suddenly changed her mind.

406
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:37,228
I'm not sure if she's coming or not.

407
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:38,668
But it's okay.

408
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,507
It's okay even if she doesn't come.

409
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,468
I have a good social circle
in the campus.

410
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:43,747
I have a lot of friends.

411
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,148
I'll promote for you when I go back.

412
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:51,868
Your flowers are beautiful.

413
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,188
How much is this?

414
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:55,827
This is not for sale.

415
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:03,787
Are you busy today?

416
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,228
If you're not busy...

417
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,628
Do you know each other?

418
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:55,668
No.

419
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:56,747
Don't you know him?

420
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:58,868
He's the idol that
you talk about every day.

421
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,388
So I've come to see how he looks like.

422
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,067
He's got nothing special.

423
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:13,148
Just an ordinary looking worker.

424
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:15,107
What are you talking about, He Ran?

425
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:16,228
I'm just being honest.

426
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:18,188
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:20,228
My roommate is a bit weird.

428
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,740
That's not what I mean.

429
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,740
I mean,

430
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,120
I don't think that you're bad.

431
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:25,307
Don't mind her.

432
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:28,420
It's okay.

433
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:33,747
He Ran, why are you here?

434
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:34,708
I want to buy flowers.

435
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:36,747
What?

436
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:39,428
Is the flower shop closed today?

437
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:45,188
No, it's opened.

438
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:48,547
Miss.

439
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,388
Miss, what flower do you want to buy?

440
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,228
Let me introduce.

441
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,228
I don't need that.

442
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:55,067
He's selling flowers, right?

443
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:59,027
What flowers are you looking for?

444
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:01,468
Rose.

445
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:03,668
How many do you want?

446
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:05,948
I want as many as you have.

447
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,500
We have 300 roses left in the shop.

448
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,860
Is that enough?

449
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,260
Yes.

450
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:13,948
I want all of them.

451
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:14,988
How much is that?

452
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:16,668
No need to pay anything.
It's a gift from me.

453
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,067
That's a big bouquet of roses.

454
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:01,668
There must be more than 100 roses here.

455
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,188
So many flowers.

456
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,188
There should be

457
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:07,708
around 200 to 300 roses.

458
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:09,428
Ding Xiaoran.

459
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,388
Not bad. In order to pursue your idol,

460
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:13,787
you're willing to spend so much.

461
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:15,628
It's so touching.

462
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,507
Did the guy from the flower shop
give you all these?

463
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:20,507
No.

464
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,787
It's not.

465
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,107
He Ran.

466
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:27,787
Are these flowers yours?

467
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,468
Who gave them to you?

468
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:34,668
The guy Ding Xiaoran
has been talking about.

469
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:42,468
Wait. What's going on?

470
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,027
He Ran.

471
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:45,827
What are you trying to do?

472
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:49,948
Nothing.

473
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:51,468
Give up.

474
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:52,908
You're not meant for each other.

475
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:55,107
It's my willingness to choose
the person I like.

476
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,388
Who are you to control that?

477
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,988
I'm not trying to control that.

478
00:24:58,628 --> 00:24:59,668
I'm just telling you.

479
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,468
Xiao Han won't fall in love with you.

480
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:04,067
Who are you to say that?

481
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:05,267
Because that's the fact.

482
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:06,468
He Ran,

483
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,428
you and Xiaoran keep talking
about this guy.

484
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,507
Do you know him?

485
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:10,827
Yes.

486
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,587
Didn't you say you don't know him?

487
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:15,388
I didn't remember
when you asked the other day.

488
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,228
When I met him yesterday,

489
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,067
I knew him.

490
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:20,388
How could you do that?

491
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:21,708
You're not meant for each other.

492
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,347
You're not meant for each other
in every way.

493
00:25:26,428 --> 00:25:27,547
Xiao Han has a child.

494
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:29,388
She's around eight or nine years old.

495
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:30,388
I was her painting teacher before.

496
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:31,507
- What?
- What?

497
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,868
- He has a child?
- He has a child?

498
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,067
Is he married?

499
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:40,347
Come on, he has a child.

500
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:42,148
Is it important that
he's married or not?

501
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:43,307
It's important.

502
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,388
There's a huge difference, okay?

503
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:46,708
Stop.

504
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:48,787
Don't take it seriously. Are you silly?

505
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:49,988
He Ran said

506
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,620
that his child is
around eight or nine years old.

507
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,420
He must not be young anymore.

508
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,507
Think about it. You're young.

509
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,027
You can't want to
be his child's stepmother.

510
00:25:57,796 --> 00:25:58,660
Stop thinking about him.

511
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,347
Yes, give up.

512
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:02,307
It's nothing. Stop loss in time.

513
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,180
I can introduce an art senior to you.

514
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:05,988
They're all handsome.

515
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:07,908
Do you like that? I can introduce you.

516
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:08,988
Yes.

517
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,388
The guys in the art club
are really attractive.

518
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,020
Ask He Ran to introduce you one.

519
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:14,188
I don't like them!

520
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,948
I like Xiao Han.

521
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:32,507
Does Xiao Han really have a child?

522
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:36,468
You can ask him if you don't believe me.

523
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:38,988
How am I supposed to ask him?

524
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,148
How am I supposed to ask him?

525
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:41,628
Just tell him that

526
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,388
I said so.

527
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:44,747
Yes.

528
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,067
I have a child.

529
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:48,908
She's nine years old.

530
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:50,747
Her name is Quanquan.

531
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:53,587
She's right.

532
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:57,988
What's your relationship with He Ran?

533
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,067
You two were...

534
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,388
Ask her about this.

535
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:05,107
Her answer is the correct answer.

536
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:07,468
That's what the florist said?

537
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,027
Yes.

538
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:10,747
Do you think

539
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,347
I should ask He Ran?

540
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,188
Ask about what?

541
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:15,307
You're silly if you ask her that.

542
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,307
Why can't you tell when it's so obvious?

543
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:18,267
That's right.

544
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,468
It's obvious that they had a past.

545
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,827
They should be a couple.

546
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:24,747
What about now?

547
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:26,347
They've broken up.

548
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,267
I think they are

549
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:31,148
not on good terms.

550
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:33,988
They've broken up, but they're
still contacting each other.

551
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:35,347
Their relationship is complicated.

552
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,948
You should stay out of it.

553
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,988
Look at how He Ran spoke.

554
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:43,307
It's obvious that they still have
lingering feelings for each other.

555
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:45,428
She is not resigned to it.

556
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:46,747
You can't grab him away from her.

557
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:48,747
Just change to another subject.

558
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:51,547
You don't know how deep they were

559
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,668
in love before.

560
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:54,547
You're just an outsider.

561
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:55,628
Unrequited love and one-sided love

562
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:57,468
have no chance.

563
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:07,708
Let's talk.

564
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:16,708
Talk about what?

565
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:18,347
Why did you come to Xijing?

566
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:22,468
I have the right to choose

567
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:23,708
which city to live in, right?

568
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:30,587
Let me rephrase my question.

569
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:32,668
You know that I'm in Xijing.

570
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:34,428
What are you doing in Xijing?

571
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:35,668
It's a coincidence.

572
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,228
Xiao Han,

573
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,340
do you think I'll believe you?

574
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:41,507
Did I look for you?

575
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:43,587
How long have you been here?

576
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:45,868
I don't know. It's not important.

577
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,787
You know that I'd look for you, right?

578
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,300
I'll take this encounter
as a coincidence.

579
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:55,388
You don't have to be troubled by it.

580
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:03,908
Ding Xiaoran

581
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:07,067
was working part-time
in the coffee shop for a reason.

582
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,347
Otherwise, she didn't have the excuse

583
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:10,988
to go near the flower shop.

584
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,708
Also, she doesn't even like flowers.

585
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,388
She's not even a member of the society,

586
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,747
but she fought for

587
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,507
the graduation ceremony decoration job.

588
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,708
She did all these for you.

589
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,747
She did that for you. Can't you tell?

590
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:28,547
Just like what you did last time?

591
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,307
You came into my life quietly

592
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,628
and you left without saying goodbye.

593
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,787
Is that what you're saying?

594
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:52,347
If there's nothing else,

595
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:53,547
please leave.

596
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,267
I don't want to hear your name

597
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:04,868
from another woman's mouth.

598
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,668
I know I'm terrible and I'm sorry,

599
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:13,347
but...

600
00:30:13,587 --> 00:30:15,787
But I just don't want to hear your name

601
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:17,468
from another woman's mouth!

602
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:18,787
Stop fooling around.

603
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:21,468
Go back early.

604
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:23,067
No.

605
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:27,908
Well,

606
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:29,107
do you need help?

607
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:29,948
No.

608
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:31,628
Give her an adhesive bandage.
Her hand is hurt.

609
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,107
Okay.

610
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:36,267
I don't need your concern.

611
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:51,827
Hurry up! We're late!

612
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:05,307
Look at you.

613
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:06,948
This is nothing like you.

614
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,267
I could hardly recognise you.

615
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:10,547
My hand is bleeding

616
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,228
and I got my face stained accidentally.

617
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:16,148
It's indeed

618
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:17,148
quite...

619
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:18,948
How do I say that?

620
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:20,347
It's unrecognisable.

621
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:24,428
Wipe it first.

622
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:27,988
You're quite good.

623
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:28,747
You can still recognise me

624
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:30,067
while I'm looking like this.

625
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:33,107
The bag that you're carrying
is our fine art's canvas bag.

626
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,787
I designed the logo on that,

627
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,587
so I took a few looks.

628
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,428
I didn't expect someone I know.

629
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,547
It's been a while.

630
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:42,988
How's the internship?

631
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:44,587
Not bad.

632
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,267
I'm coming back for
the graduation ceremony.

633
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:50,547
What about you? What's happened to you?

634
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:55,827
I broke up with my boyfriend.

635
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,840
What a coincidence.
I've also broken up with my girlfriend.

636
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:05,948
What a coincidence.

637
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:07,388
You seem okay though.

638
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,268
Yes. Compared to how you looked now,

639
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,828
I'm nothing like
I've just had a break-up.

640
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,860
I'm shameful.

641
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:14,388
You're not hurt too bad.

642
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:16,788
How do I put it?

643
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:19,868
It's more like regret than hurt.

644
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:23,507
Let's go.

645
00:34:24,107 --> 00:34:25,147
Let me send you back.

646
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:27,507
Let's go.

647
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:48,908
Mahjong? I'm not in Qiongzhou.

648
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,868
I've come to Xijing
for my brother's graduation ceremony.

649
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,308
Of course I have to come.

650
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,908
He's the only university student

651
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:56,428
in Zhang family.

652
00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:57,507
He's got a master's degree.

653
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,260
No worries.

654
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,507
Wait until I get back to Qiongzhou.

655
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,560
That's it.
I have an incoming phone call.

656
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,260
I'm hanging up.

657
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,308
This.

658
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,027
This. This.

659
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:10,868
Fatty!

660
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:12,707
No need.

661
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,107
Why do you want to send a car over?

662
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,067
I took a taxi.
I'm already in the campus.

663
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:17,748
Yes.

664
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:22,147
You're not bad. After half a year,

665
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:23,988
you even sound like a boss now.

666
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:26,627
Serve me?

667
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:28,788
Look, when I get to your territory,

668
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,468
you must treat me well.

669
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,828
Dinner. Dinner is fine.

670
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:33,908
I'll bring my brother over.

671
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:35,988
Who? His girlfriend?

672
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:37,948
I've never met her.

673
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,627
I'll just bring them along.

674
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:41,868
Don't worry.

675
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:43,667
You just have to make the arrangement.

676
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:44,988
I'll bring the people,

677
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:46,107
okay?

678
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:47,388
Okay.

679
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:49,788
I've found my brother.

680
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,388
That's it for now. See you tonight.

681
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:52,428
Okay.

682
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:53,227
Happy graduation.

683
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:54,388
Thank you.

684
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:56,948
Zhang Yuanqi!

685
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:00,348
Xiaoli.

686
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:01,348
Xiaoli?

687
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:04,627
He Ran.

688
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,828
You know my sister?

689
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:07,748
Yes.

690
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:09,828
I've stayed in Xiaoli's homestay before.

691
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:12,468
This is a small world.

692
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:14,828
Junior, can you come

693
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,940
and take a picture for us?

694
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,260
Okay. Carry on.

695
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,080
Okay.

696
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,120
Are you very close to her?

697
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:22,428
Why did she give you flowers?

698
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:24,107
The flowers are for my graduation.

699
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:25,468
She and I are from the same university.

700
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:26,388
She is from a few batches after me.

701
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,067
Xiaoli,

702
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:29,428
how did you get to know her?

703
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:31,468
Do you know the man in the painting?

704
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,147
What man in the painting?

705
00:36:33,468 --> 00:36:35,027
Don't interrupt. Listen to me first.

706
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:36,868
Didn't you say you're in a relationship?

707
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:38,828
Is it her?

708
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:41,627
Let me tell you.

709
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,468
He Ran is actually...

710
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:48,948
After all, a girl always

711
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,980
changes her mind.

712
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:52,027
Anyway, you shouldn't mingle with her.

713
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,680
Do you understand?

714
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:54,587
Otherwise, I can't face Xiao Han.

715
00:36:57,908 --> 00:36:59,227
The guy in the painting is
called Xiao Han?

716
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:00,667
Lower your voice.

717
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:01,667
No.

718
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:03,107
Are you listening to me?

719
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:05,348
I'm asking you. Are you two

720
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:07,107
in a relationship?

721
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:08,908
Of course not. What are you thinking?

722
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:10,587
Didn't you say you're in a relationship?

723
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:11,707
I...

724
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:14,707
It's not her.

725
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,107
Really? Don't lie to me.

726
00:37:17,227 --> 00:37:18,067
It's really not her.

727
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:19,507
Wait for me.

728
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:20,187
I just don't believe that.

729
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:21,788
Let's take a picture.

730
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:22,268
Sure.

731
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:23,547
Come on. Let's take a picture.

732
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:24,308
Let me hold the flower for you.

733
00:37:24,388 --> 00:37:24,868
Okay.

734
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,948
I don't want to talk to He Ran.

735
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:28,468
I think

736
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
you're being narrow-minded.

737
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:32,707
This is about you
having an one-sided love,

738
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:33,187
right?

739
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:34,428
You can't blame He Ran for this.

740
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:37,428
Also, she was his girlfriend first.

741
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:38,707
Well, it should be

742
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:40,147
"first come, first served."

743
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:42,027
I think you're being unreasonable.

744
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,547
I'm just not happy.

745
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:46,147
Stop thinking about it.

746
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:47,788
Let's take a picture with

747
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:48,428
the art senior.

748
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,627
He's handsome

749
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:52,308
and capable.

750
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:55,507
We won't see him anymore
after the graduation.

751
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:56,627
We need to take a picture

752
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,507
to remember this, right?

753
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,580
He Ran is here, too.

754
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,860
Ask her to get his number for us.

755
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,040
Let's go.

756
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:04,707
Hello, I'm Yu Jingjing

757
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:05,507
and she's Ding Xiaoran.

758
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:06,988
We're He Ran's roommates.

759
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:08,667
Hello.

760
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,027
We'd like to take a picture with him.

761
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:12,507
Can you talk to him?

762
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:12,908
Okay.

763
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:15,107
She wants to take a picture with you.

764
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:15,988
Okay.

765
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:16,748
Hurry! Let's take a picture!

766
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,380
Here. Three, two, one.

767
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:19,707
Smile!

768
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:21,308
One more!

769
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,067
Okay. Perfect.

770
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,308
Thank you.

771
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:26,948
Is it nice?

772
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:28,067
It's nice.

773
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:29,788
You have a big smile on your face.

774
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:31,268
He Ran.

775
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,948
Come take a picture with the senior.

776
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:34,908
Okay.

777
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:36,868
Three, two...

778
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:39,227
Why did you agree?

779
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:39,988
I think it's a bad idea.

780
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:41,707
I should be in the picture, right?

781
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:42,868
Why are you here?

782
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,868
I'm here to send my brother flowers.

783
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:45,988
Han Yu asked me to join.

784
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:46,627
So I'm here.

785
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:47,587
Happy graduation.

786
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,587
I missed you because
I haven't seen you for a while.

787
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,147
You're just everywhere.

788
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,308
Why do you say terrible things
like that?

789
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:55,627
I'm being determined.

790
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:57,187
Do you know that
I'm too lazy to scold you?

791
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:59,067
Then you should compliment me.

792
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:01,667
You shouldn't learn about broadcasting

793
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,027
and you shouldn't play in a band.

794
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,707
You should go for crosstalk.
It suits you.

795
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:10,107
Enough. You should stop laughing.

796
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:11,868
You're graduating.

797
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:13,587
After you left the campus,

798
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:15,627
stay away from He Ran.

799
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:17,227
Happy graduation.

800
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,187
Take a picture together.

801
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,960
Stand next to He Ran.

802
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,340
Okay.

803
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:23,428
Come on. Let's take a picture.

804
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:24,067
Come on. Let's take a picture.

805
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:26,187
Come on.

806
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,948
Three, two, one.

807
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:34,468
Okay.

808
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:34,988
Okay.

809
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:37,667
Come on. Let's eat dinner together.

810
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:39,147
Knowing each means we're fated.

811
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:39,908
All of us must go.

812
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:40,948
Okay. Thank you.

813
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:42,868
Xiaoran, join us.

814
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,107
We can go home together at night.

815
00:39:44,428 --> 00:39:44,627
Okay.

816
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:45,348
I'm going, too.

817
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:46,027
Sure.

818
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:46,868
Why do you want to go?

819
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:48,868
I'm the family member.

820
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:50,507
Whose family member?
You're not my family member.

821
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:52,227
Who is talking about you?

822
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:54,107
The bassist in my band

823
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:55,988
is his cousin, right?

824
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:57,627
Of course I'm a family member.

825
00:39:58,348 --> 00:39:58,788
Am I right?

826
00:39:58,948 --> 00:39:59,908
Yes!

827
00:40:00,308 --> 00:40:00,788
Hey,

828
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:02,147
your friend's personality

829
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:02,948
is interesting.

830
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:07,587
I'm late. Sorry.

831
00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:11,227
Hold me!

832
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,828
Fatty.

833
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,507
Not bad. You're doing well in Xijing.

834
00:40:15,828 --> 00:40:17,428
Here, let me introduce.

835
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,627
He's my best friend in Qiongzhou.

836
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:22,067
He's doing business in Xijing.

837
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:23,587
Look. He's a big boss now.

838
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,428
He should buy us dinner tonight.

839
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,268
You should eat and drink
as much as you can.

840
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:29,587
Eat and drink as much as you can.

841
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:30,547
Yes.

842
00:40:30,587 --> 00:40:31,147
You're flattering me.

843
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:32,348
Actually, my company

844
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:33,428
is just starting to earn money.

845
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:34,067
Come. Sit down.

846
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:34,587
- Sit here.
- Sit here.

847
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,667
Mr. Han is taking care of me.

848
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:37,828
You have someone helping you.

849
00:40:38,627 --> 00:40:39,067
Not bad.

850
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:39,587
Yes.

851
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,268
Mr. Han?

852
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:41,227
My uncle?

853
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:44,868
You...

854
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:49,587
Are you the one
who sent me to the hospital?

855
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,868
You still remember how brave I was.

856
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:52,868
Han Yu, right?

857
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:54,147
We're fated.

858
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,428
You're wearing all green.

859
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:58,027
Young man. Fashion.

860
00:40:58,107 --> 00:40:58,868
This colour is trendy this year.

861
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:00,067
Yes. Look at mine.

862
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:00,707
Flowery and green.

863
00:41:00,788 --> 00:41:02,067
This is a small world.

864
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:02,948
We're meeting acquaintances.

865
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:03,707
- High-spirited.
- We're all friends.

866
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:04,428
- We're all friends.
- We're all friends.

867
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,300
What are you doing?

868
00:41:09,707 --> 00:41:11,187
You silly, why are you so surprised?

869
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,788
When I first came to Xijing

870
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:15,507
and saw He Ran, I was surprised too.

871
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:16,828
That's why I said the world is small.

872
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:17,868
Let me tell you.

873
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,027
He Ran and my brother

874
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:22,067
are from the same university.

875
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:23,107
She's his junior.

876
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:24,227
Don't you think it's a coincidence?

877
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:25,388
Yes.

878
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:26,988
It is.

879
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:28,547
