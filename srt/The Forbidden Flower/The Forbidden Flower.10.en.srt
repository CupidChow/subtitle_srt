00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,780
Xiao Han.

5
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,390
I have toothache.

6
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,110
I'll get the medicine for you.

7
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,550
No.

8
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,700
Don't leave.

9
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,340
Stay with me.

10
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,220
Who is calling you?

11
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,310
Quanquan.

12
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,830
Pick it up here.

13
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,750
Okay.

14
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,990
Tell her.

15
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,470
What "okay"?

16
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,190
What were you talking about?

17
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,620
She said she's missing you.

18
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,820
Really?

19
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,590
I don't believe that.

20
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,150
Why are you being so serious
with a child?

21
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,150
Well,

22
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,220
didn't you say

23
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,030
I'm your child, too?

24
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,620
What?

25
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,030
Am I not your child anymore?

26
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,100
As long as you want to be my child,

27
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,190
you'll always be my child.

28
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,220
Give me your hometown address.

29
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,310
Why?

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,310
Quanquan

31
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,100
is talented in painting.

32
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,340
I want to send her
some painting materials

33
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,990
to keep her painting.

34
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,190
Is that okay?

35
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,270
Take a rest.

(Ma'am Zhang: Quickly come back.
Can't explain to your mother.)

47
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,980
(Mother: I'm worried about you.
Don't make me worried.)

(Mother)

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,300

50
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
(I apologise.)

51
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,030
(Ranran, you're sick.)

52
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,860
(Don't stay out there for too long.)

53
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,980
(This is a CG-made goldfish)
(Come home)

54
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,340
(and talk to me,)

55
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,340
(okay?)

56
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,710
(Toothache and a high fever.)

57
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,340
(I have a bad feeling in my heart.)

58
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,070
(I'm starting to be afraid.)

59
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
(I'm afraid that
my sickness will relapse.)

60
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,390
(I'm afraid that
I'll be like this goldfish.)

61
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,220
(I can't save it.)

62
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,980
(I can't save myself either.)

63
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,980
(I love Xiao Han.)

64
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,590
(I don't want to leave him.)

65
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,830
(I can't imagine how sad he'll be)

66
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,390
(if he knows I'm sick.)

67
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,590
(Perhaps)

68
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,220
(I should leave.)

69
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:47,740
(Mother)

70
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,710
Tomorrow.

71
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,540
I can buy you another one.

72
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,540
Or I can prepare a bigger aquarium.

73
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,070
You can keep any fish you want.

74
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,980
Xiao Han.

75
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,910
I'm going home tomorrow.

76
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,980
I'll be going to Xijing.

77
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,910
Then

78
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,060
I'll not be looking for you anymore.

79
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,460
You know what I mean, right?

80
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,060
Remember to miss me.

81
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,460
Xiao Han.

82
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,350
Were you

83
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,420
in deep love

84
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,110
with a woman before?

85
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,390
Who told you that?

86
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,350
I guessed it.

87
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,820
Fatty and Man have mentioned it.

88
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,870
It was a long time ago.

89
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,780
Tell your about your story with her.

90
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,150
So,

91
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,940
do you still love her?

92
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,820
That's not the question.

93
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,390
It's just an experience.

94
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,030
Xiao Han.

95
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,540
You'll meet a better woman.

96
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,940
You deserve it.

97
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,620
Sleep now.

98
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,150
Do you want to drink water?

99
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,940
No. Let's sleep.

100
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,150
Eat something.

101
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,390
No.

102
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,990
I have no appetite.

103
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,110
Let me see you out.

104
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,030
Xiao Han.

105
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,540
Stay here.

106
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,910
So...

107
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,540
Bye.

108
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,230
I'm leaving.

109
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,940
(Xiao Han.)

110
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,580
(Others' 20 years)

111
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,540
(could be my whole life.)

112
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,540
(My life is too short.)

113
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,110
(I can only love one person.)

114
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,780
It's water under the bridge.

115
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,110
Let it go.

116
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,630
I'll study well in Xijing,

117
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,270
but can you promise me one thing?

118
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,820
Go ahead.

119
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,510
Stop checking on me.

120
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:32,620
(Hairdressing)

121
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,910
Mr. Han?

122
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,740
It's been a while.

123
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
I was just passing by.

124
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,500
I got to know your address
after asking Fatty.

125
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,350
I'm sorry that I came uninvited.

126
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,740
No worries.

127
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,590
It's about the same as I imagined.

128
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,020
You're professional.

129
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,110
A few years back, I was

130
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,940
taking part in some plant-related awards

131
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,660
and auctions in Europe.

132
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,390
The winner was

133
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,590
an Asian cultivator.

134
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,980
The cultivation patent

135
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,660
received a handsome amount

136
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,220
in the auction.

137
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,980
Then I heard that

138
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,350
something happened to

139
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,870
this Asian cultivator.

140
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,740
The cultivation method was lost.

141
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,700
Only ten auctioned plants

142
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,110
survived.

143
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,700
But, I heard that

144
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,150
only two are still surviving.

145
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,110
You...

146
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,390
It's not me.

147
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,180
I know.

148
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,390
I've met that girl.

149
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,870
She's very young.

150
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,500
Do you know her?

151
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,070
It's because of this plant.

152
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,980
If I'm not mistaken...

153
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,700
I know her.

154
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,830
It's...

155
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,630
It's a long time ago.

156
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,110
So,

157
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,110
you actually know
the value of the plants here.

158
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,350
The patented plant cultivation,

159
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,020
research and development system in Japan

160
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,260
has been doing well in the recent years.

161
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,070
If you're willing,

162
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,500
I can help you to arrange...

163
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,630
Just let them stay here.

164
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,790
I looked for someone to

165
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,980
design the greenhouse here

166
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,980
according to the environment
suitable for the plants.

167
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,220
So, it's suitable for them to grow.

168
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,390
Flowers are the same as humans,
aren't they?

169
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,790
As long as they're staying in a place
that's suitable for them,

170
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,150
they'll be comfortable.

171
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,910
Yes.

172
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,830
It makes sense.

173
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,420
I'll not disturb you anymore.

174
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Let me see you out.

175
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,910
I'll invite you over to my garden
for a cup of tea.

176
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,700
You'll not reject me, right?

177
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,500
I have some precious plants
in my garden.

178
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,460
I'd not let others touch them.

179
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,070
I can only

180
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,500
trust you with that.

181
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,260
Sure.

182
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,310
When I'm not busy,

183
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,460
I'll surely go over and help you.

184
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,740
Be careful with the staircase.

185
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,740
I know the person who painted this.

186
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,220
Is this painting important to you?

187
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,500
I know the person who painted this.

188
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,220
I think the painting

189
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,420
shouldn't be hanging here.

190
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,070
Shouldn't you look for

191
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,260
a safer place?

192
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,460
I mean, hanging it here

193
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,150
is a little too casual.

194
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,180
Okay.

195
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,070
It's up to you.

196
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,390
Na.

197
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,740
Help me investigate a person.

198
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,590
Yes.

199
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,550
I'll send you the information.

200
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,790
Okay.

201
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,180
- Come on!
- Come on!

202
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,740
Let's wish Yu a bright future

203
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,020
and be successful!

204
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,420
Let's start the great journey!

205
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,980
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

206
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,980
Let's start the great journey!

207
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,630
Come on!

208
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,310
Xiao Han.

209
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,790
What flower is this?

210
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,420
Baby blue eyes.

211
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,700
Baby blue eyes.

212
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,020
It's the blue flower

213
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,260
that I always see by the roadside,

214
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,070
right?

215
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,630
That should be veronica polita.

216
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,550
Aren't they the same?

217
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,350
But they look alike.

218
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,260
It's indeed hard to differentiate them.

219
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,550
Baby blue eyes are very seldom
in the country.

220
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,020
We can see them frequently overseas.

221
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,150
Just like Tina and Matthew in
the Japanese comic,

222
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,460
Ancient Magus.

223
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,500
They were both gone in the middle

224
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,020
of baby blue eyes
after their last meeting.

225
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,740
Look.

226
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,550
Baby blue eyes have five petals.

227
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,220
Veronica polita have four petals.

228
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,550
One, two, three, four, five.

229
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,550
You're baby blue eyes,

230
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,220
not veronica polita.

231
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
The verification is done.

232
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,790
You must be He Ran.

233
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,310
I told you.

234
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,630
It must be her.

235
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,660
Have we met?

236
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,220
No, but I've seen you before.

237
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,630
When you were sick few years back,

238
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,420
Han Yu and I have visited you
in the hospital.

239
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,070
But you were

240
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,830
not as beautiful as now.

241
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,740
To be honest, I didn't
really recognise you.

242
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,630
Are you're fully recovered?

243
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,350
You were bald back then

244
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
like a nun.

245
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,870
I was so frightened

246
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,350
and didn't enter the room.

247
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,790
I was just watching outside the ward.

248
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,180
I don't mean it that way.

249
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,150
I'm just saying,

250
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,660
you're recovered now

251
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,110
and your hair is long.

252
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,070
It's beautiful.

253
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,870
No worries.

254
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,390
I think I was frightening.

255
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,790
Let's go.

256
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,020
You shouldn't have said that.

257
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,870
I told you not to come and talk to her.

258
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,150
Her personality is still
the same as before.

259
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,590
She was that cold before?

260
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,980
Not really.

261
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
It's after she got sick.

262
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,740
You don't know.

263
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,070
Her father committed suicide.

264
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Isn't he the famous painter?

265
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
- Yes.
- He committed suicide?

266
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,460
Also, after her father passed away,

267
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,830
she was diagnosed with the disease.

268
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,220
She was staying in the hospital
for chemotherapy for two years.

269
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,220
She's considered very lucky.

270
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,740
Luckily she's recovered.

271
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,660
We can't be sure.

272
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,590
My mother is a doctor.

273
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,420
My mother said the chances

274
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,260
of getting a relapse are high.

275
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
What happens if she gets a relapse?

276
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,870
She'll die.

277
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,790
So scary?

278
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,310
Someone else is investigating him, too.

279
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,390
Who is that?

280
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,830
You know this person.

281
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,070
Mr. Han.

282
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,790
Why are you not hanging out
with Yu and the rest?

283
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,310
No.

284
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,660
I don't know them.

285
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,390
I don't know what to say.

286
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,660
Ran,

287
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,110
you know Xiao Han, don't you?

288
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,260
Xiao Han

289
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,390
is

290
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,980
the horticulturist you hired, right?

291
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,180
I know him.

292
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,460
Your mother

293
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,660
is getting someone to check on him.

294
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,500
Why is she doing that?

295
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,220
We've broken up.

296
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,630
I won't look for him anymore.

297
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,350
I don't wish my mother
to know about this.

298
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,870
I don't wish her to disturb Xiao Han.

299
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,260
Mr. Han, I promise that

300
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,700
I won't look for him anymore.

301
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,500
Please help me.

302
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,700
I know you can do it.

303
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,550
Please help me.

304
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,310
Okay.

305
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,110
Let me deal with it.

306
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,910
Thank you.

307
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,110
Let's take a group photo.

308
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,420
Why are you two hiding here?

309
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,350
Are you studying the plants again?

310
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,070
Uncle, let's take a group photo.

311
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,980
Today is the highlight

312
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,660
of your nephew.

313
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,790
Let's go.

314
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,980
He Ran.

315
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,630
When we're taking the photo,

316
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,870
I'll be standing in the centre
and you'll be standing next to me.

317
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,660
No.

318
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,830
Come on.

319
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,150
If you won't do that, what's purpose
of my holding this farewell party?

320
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,910
No.

321
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,220
It's just a group photo.

322
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
Three, two, one.

323
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,630
Young Forever!

324
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,740
Do you want to bring your umbrella?

325
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,660
Why does she need the umbrella?

326
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,390
We can just buy one in Xijing.

327
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,350
Mrs. Qiu.

328
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,660
Ranran, hurry up.

329
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,260
Mr. Han's family is on their way.

330
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,550
We need to go to the airport together.

331
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,020
Zhang,

332
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,220
come help me pack this.

333
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,150
Coming.

334
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,740
I'm leaving.

335
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,660
I'll leave the bed here to you.

336
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,740
Xiao Han.

337
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,630
Why didn't the flowers
you bought blossom?

338
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,020
You'll know.

339
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,420
Well...

340
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,310
What's going on with the cat?

341
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,740
It's in love.

342
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,110
Xiao.

343
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,260
The girl has left her phone here.

344
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,700
She shouldn't have gone far.

345
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,070
