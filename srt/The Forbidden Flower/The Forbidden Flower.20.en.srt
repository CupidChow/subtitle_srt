3
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,660
Why aren't you leaving?

4
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,630
I promise you

5
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,220
to get treatment in Xijing.

6
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,580
I thought you wouldn't
let me control you.

7
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm sorry, mother.

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,470
You said you couldn't live without him

9
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,190
and you'd rather die to stay with him.

10
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,550
Mother.

11
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,990
Am I really going to die?

12
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,940
Don't talk nonsense.

13
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,910
I'm here.

14
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,940
Nothing will happen to us.

15
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,310
We will be fine.

16
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,310
Trust me.

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,380
Don't ever say that again.

18
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,700
Mother.

19
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,500
Do you know sea flatworms?

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,260
No.

21
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,070
I'm in no mood to learn about worms.

22
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,190
Sea flatworms

23
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,150
are a hermaphroditic marine creature.

24
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,030
When they breed,

25
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
they fight

26
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,310
to decide

27
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,540
who will be the father

28
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,030
and who will be the mother.

29
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,540
Is the winner the mother?

30
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,070
The loser will become the mother.

31
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,820
The loser is the mother?

32
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,070
In nature,

33
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,150
females will have

34
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,070
a harder time surviving than males,

35
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,220
while the males

36
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,260
are responsible for mating.

37
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,310
After mating,

38
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
the male will leave,

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,190
leaving the female alone

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,380
through the long pregnancy

41
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,940
and the extremely painful birth period.

42
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,660
After pregnancy,
animals' food intake increases

43
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,030
and their ability to escape
from predators decreases.

44
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,500
And

45
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,750
for female animals at
the bottom of the food chain,

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,030
giving birth

47
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,980
is the most

48
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,500
dangerous time of their lives.

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,660
When the offspring are born,

50
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,750
the female will release

51
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,100
a large amount of body fluid.

52
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,350
These bodily fluids

53
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,940
give off a strong odour.

54
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,470
Then predators will follow the scent

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,750
and hunt them.

56
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,540
Many females

57
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,700
will sacrifice themselves

58
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,310
to protect their offspring.

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,750
In both nature

60
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,460
and human society,

61
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,500
being a mother is not easy.

62
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,460
Who

63
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,900
taught you all this?

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,310
He taught me.

65
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,340
It's all him.

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,700
I now realise

67
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,230
that he has taught me so much.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,860
♪You're in my palms♪

69
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,190
Did he teach you all this?

70
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,460
My daughter

71
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,380
has really grown up.

72
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,550
Mother.

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,580
If humans

74
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,580
had a choice

75
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,940
like flatworms,

76
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,900
would you still choose to be a mother?

77
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,700
Of course.

78
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,820
Why.

79
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,430
Being a mother is so tough, so tiring

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,900
and so scary.

81
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,500
Ranran.

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,940
Listen.

83
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,700
Women are vulnerable,

84
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,140
but mothers are strong.

85
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,230
I'm here.

86
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
We have nothing to fear.

87
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,340
We will be fine.

88
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,500
Trust me.

89
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,070
Trust me.

90
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,500
Mother.

91
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,790
Mother, I love you so much.

92
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,980

(Doctor-in-charge, Sun Yiliang)

94
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,190
Sister, are you sick too?

95
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,430
I...

96
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,700
I...

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,500
Son.

98
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,190
Come here. Don't disturb her.

99
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,020
Sit down.

100
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,260
Leukocytes have slightly rebounded.

101
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,750
This is not a good sign.

102
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,580
Fortunately, other indices
are still normal.

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,230
We advise the patient to
continue taking Chinese medicine.

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,790
If possible,

105
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,240
it is best to stay in the hospital
for a few days for observation.

106
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:19,820
Okay.

107
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,110
Thank you, doctor.

108
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,670
You don't have to worry too much.

109
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,190
Fortunately, she was sent here in time.

110
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,940
Her condition seems more optimistic now.

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,630
Thank you.

112
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,700
Thank you.

(Xiao Han)

115
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,150
I know you don't like being in hospital.

116
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,310
Look.

117
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,270
Mr. Han found this house
especially for you.

118
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,670
Do you like it?

119
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,310
It is quite close to the hospital

120
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,740
and very quiet.

121
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,390
I also found you a caretaker.

122
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,910
She will come to clean every day

123
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,510
and cook you three meals a day.

124
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,220
But she won't stay here.

125
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,430
You said

126
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,390
you don't like having
outsiders in the house.

127
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,100
She'll never interfere
with your personal life.

128
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,430
Thank you.

129
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
My baby.

130
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,460
Mr. Han and his family

131
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,510
are coming to see you from Qiongzhou.

132
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,190
Let me know what you want to eat.

133
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,100
Anything is fine. I'll leave it to you.

134
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,910
Okay.

135
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,790
Get some rest.

136
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,670
I'll pick you up later.

137
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,270
Be happy.

138
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,430
I'll get going.

139
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,550
Ma'am.

140
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,800
Give her some fruit.

141
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,430
Okay.

142
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,460
Ms. He, eat some fruit.

143
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,620
(Xijing, June)

144
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,340
Yes?

145
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,790
Ms. He, your phone is ringing.

146
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,700
Don't pick it up. Just leave it.

147
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,190
I've put you through.

148

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,790
(commit to this relationship
in the first place, did you?)

Time flies.

191
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,550
- It's been a year.
- It's been a year.

192
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,800
Why did you change the card?

193
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,700
Don't you use this number anymore?

194
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,220
I actually like your phone number.

195
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,620
The middle four digits are my birthday,

196
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,670
right?

197
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,940
We are so destined.

198
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,340
I had a dream.

199
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,550
In my dreams, I've run away for too long.

200
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,740
It's time to return to reality.

201
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,100
By the way,

202
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,340
I ran into Man on my way here.

203
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,940
She wanted me to remind you

204
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,820
that you have to pay the rent

205
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,220
even if you don't stay here.

206
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,310
After all, you've got

207
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,340
so much dirt up there.

208
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,310
She can't lease it to anyone else.

209
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,820
So, did Mr. Han

210
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,580
promise to take care
of this garden for you?

211
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,510
It's a shame.

212
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,080
The flowers are so valuable.

213
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,700
So many people came for them.

214
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,860
I told you to sell the flowers.

215
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,670
Now you are

216
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,740
giving them away
instead of selling them.

217
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,460
Gosh.

218
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,910
You're at a loss this time.

219
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,700
He promised he would
take good care of it.

220
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,150
Yes.

221
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,510
I believe he can take care of it.

222
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,940
If he hadn't helped my company,

223
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,310
my business wouldn't
have been able to boom.

224
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,430
The point is that I think you...

225
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,150
You...

226
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,220
Look at all this.

227
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,500
(Truck transport)

228
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,790
I'll get the car.

229
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,550
Well,

230
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,910
we will move them together later.

231
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:39,300
(I love you)

232
00:17:45,180 --> 00:18:10,180
(I love you)

233
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,820
(Han Yu)

234
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,860
He Ran, open the door.

235
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,990
He Ran, it's me.

236
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,580
He Ran.

237
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,750
Open the door, He Ran.

238
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,900
Gosh.

239
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,860
Why did it take you
so long to open the door?

240
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,580
It's already late

241
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,860
and you just woke up.

242
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,820
I called you a dozen times.

243
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,310
I thought you weren't home.

244
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,990
Luckily, my repeated knocking

245
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,180
woke you up.

246
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,950
Why are you here?

247
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,860
To look after you.

248
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,660
My aunt and I

249
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,340
promised Mrs. Qiu

250
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,180
that I will take care of you
while you're in Xijing

251
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,310
for check-ups.

252
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,340
I will arrange everything for you.

253
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,310
I don't believe you.

254
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,580
Why don't you believe me? Look at these.

255
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,660
Groceries.

256
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,990
I bought all these.

257
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:40,990
And look at this.

258
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,710
Tonic soft-shelled turtle.

259
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,270
Where is it?

260
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,900
Tonic soft-shelled turtle.

261
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,310
It's moving.

262
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,140
Put it down.

263
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,230
It's still alive.

264
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,990
Can you cook?

265
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,270
Don't underestimate me.

266
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,710
My nickname is

267
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,580
Folk Michelin Chef.

268
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,510
Forget it.

269
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,030
You'll get me poisoned.

270
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,710
That won't happen.

271
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,510
These are all fresh ingredients.

272
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,900
I know

273
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,380
you feel very vulnerable

274
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,380
during your treatment alone.

275
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,470
Don't worry.

276
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,340
I'll be with you all the way,

277
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,420
to be your strongest support.

278
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,990
I don't need that now.

279
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,380
I'm not dead yet.

280
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,580
No.

281
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,340
I'm sleepy.

282
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
You should leave.

283
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,750
Your company is quite far away.

284
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,660
Don't trouble yourself.

285
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,340
Not at all.

286
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,270
Just tens of kilometres.

287
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,380
Besides,

288
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,860
I came here by motorcycle.

289
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,950
You didn't even see

290
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,180
how handsome I was when I hit the road.

291
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,660
Don't you have anything better to do?

292
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,950
Doesn't your band have to rehearse?

293
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,710
Band?

294
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,070
Disbanded again?

295
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,030
What are you talking about?

296
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,380
It's called

297
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,550
another optimisation and upgrade.

298
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,820
Okay, I got it.

299
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,790
Don't worry.

300
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,230
I'm going to stop
playing music for a while.

301
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,470
I'll focus on you.

302
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,420
Concentrate on accompanying you.

303
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,620
Han Yu, are you sick?

304
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,180
You're the one who's sick.

305
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,380
You are really sick.

306
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,760
Yes, my body is sick,
but your brain is sick.

307
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,100
No, I didn't mean that.

308
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,420
I mean...

309
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm a scourge.

310
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,070
Get away from me.

311
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,990
No.

312
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,950
- Get out.
- He Ran.

313
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,950
Go away.

314
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,710
Okay.

315
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,230
Don't be angry.

316
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,030
It's not good for your body.

317
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,710
I...

318
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,070
I'll call you

319
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,550
when I've finished cooking.
Come out and eat then.

320
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,470
It's all very tonic.

321
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,380
This is a token of my appreciation.

322
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,550
Please accept it. Thank you.

323
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,360
Just come back tomorrow as usual.

324
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,520
You don't have to buy
the groceries, I'll do it.

325
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,420
Thank you.

326
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,790
Then see you tomorrow.

327
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,310
Goodbye.

328
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,340
Perfect.

329
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,620
He Ran.

330
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,510
Dinner is ready.

331
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,070
Well, I put a lot of effort into it.

332
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,790
Why don't you come out and have a taste?

333
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,420
All of my dishes are rich in nutrients

334
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,470
and are very tonic.

335
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,200
I guarantee you'll be strong and fit.

336
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,620
Strong and fit?

337
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,030
Do you think I'm Popeye?

338
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,260
You can be Popeye.

339
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,340
I have spinach.

340
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,070
Come on.

341
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,380
Sit down.

342
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,470
What do you think?

343
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,790
Are you referring to the dishes or you?

344
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,710
Of course the dishes.

345
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,180
I...

346
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,620
Take a look at me as well.

347
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,510
They look pretty good.

348
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,070
You can give the caretaker

349
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,180
a pay rise.

350
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,140
I told you I cooked it all myself.

351
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,470
This has nothing to do with her.

352
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,750
With this apron,

353
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,900
you look...

354
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,820
Like what?

355
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,140
Girly.

356
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,710
What?

357
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,710
Fine.

358
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,310
I'll serve you a bowl of soup.

359
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,710
This soft-shelled turtle
is a great tonic.

360
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,140
You must try it.

361
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,230
It looks a bit weird.
I don't want to eat it.

362
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,140
What do you mean?

363
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,860
Isn't this how it should look?

364
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,790
Besides,

365
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,180
I also put some amaranth in it.

366
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,360
The soup is pink.

367
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,550
Look how romantic it is.

368
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,230
It's really delicious.

369
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,620
Try it.

370
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,420
Drink more.

371
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,100
I...

372
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,660
Why don't you try this duck?

373
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,900
This duck doesn't look weird, right?

374
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,230
Look how beautiful it is.

375
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,510
This duck looks a bit

376
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,270
"unfaithful".

377
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,550
What?

378
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,900
Unfaithful?

379
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
I think this duck is quite loyal.

380
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,510
How cute it is.

381
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,860
As expected of the duck I picked.

382
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,100
All right. You've cooked

383
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,510
and taken care of me.

384
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,750
Go back now.

385
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,790
Be safe on your motorbike.

386
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,140
Notice your aunt
when you get home safely.

387
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,950
What's wrong?

388
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,000
Do you really have a stomachache?

389
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,310
Or is it a trick

390
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,340
to stay here with me?

391
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,270
No, my stomach hurts.

392
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,070
I'm in so much pain.

393
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,820
What should I do?

394
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,100
Call an ambulance.

395
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,380

It's not me. It's your nephew.

402
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,180
He got food poisoning.

403
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
Don't blame him.

404
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,230
He was just being nice.

405
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,180
Forget it. You should scold him.

406
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,950
Tell him not to bother me anymore.

407
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,100
Okay.

408
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,990
