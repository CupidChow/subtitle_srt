What?

4
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,050
Give me a hug.

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,930
Xiao Han.

6
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,610
Were you Lu Ban in your previous life?

7
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,610
Then were you Van Gogh
in your previous life?

8
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,880
I don't want to be Van Gogh.

9
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,000
His life was too hard.

10
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,570
I want to be Monet,

11
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,130
to have a passionate love

12
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,770
and then die.

13
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Was there no artist with a happy ending?

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,400
There were,

15
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,610
but few.

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,610
Those whom the Gods love die young.

17
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,450
That's why we have to
enjoy life to the fullest.

18
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,610
Aren't we enjoying it now?

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,560
Not really.

20
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,930
I need your help.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,120
What do you want?

22
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,080
Help me.

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
I haven't agreed yet.

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,400
I have a question.

25
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,120
Xiao Han.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,490
Do you still mean what
you said to me before?

27
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,680
You said

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,210
if I have a wish,

29
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,210
I can tell you directly.

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,610
Does it still count?

31
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,450
I will do my best.

32
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,890
Actually, my wish

33
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,400
is quite simple.

34
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,840
You don't have to
give it your best shot.

35
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,680
You just

36
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,170
have to sacrifice

37
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,330
a little bit.

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,520
What is it?

39
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,610
Be my model.

40
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,050
See?

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
You just swore

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,290
to do your best.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,610
And now you turn your back on it

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,610
when I bring it up.

45
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,400
As expected. I can't trust men's words.

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,640
Why are you so obsessed with this?

47
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,680
You see, I'm still

48
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,960
a little-known artist,

49
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,930
but I've met

50
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,490
my muse

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
and I want him to be my model.

52
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,960
There's nothing wrong with that.

53
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,680
What do you mean by obsession?

54
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,520
This is the pursuit of art.

55
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Another wish.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,730
No.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
Xiao Han.

58
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,330
Tell me your other wishes.

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
And what if I tell you

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,730
and you refuse again?

61
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll do it as long
as it's something else.

62
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,960
Promise?

63
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,640
Promise.

64
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,330
Then you don't need to be my model.

65
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,840
Be my drawing board.

66
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,650
Xiao Han.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,440
You are really something.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
You are so concentrative.

69
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,850
I've been painting like this
for two or three hours,

70
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,440
but you've managed to remain still.

71
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,530
I'm so numb I've lost consciousness.

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,560
This is your punishment.

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
What did I do wrong?

74
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,930
Your fault is that you refuse
to sacrifice yourself for art.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,650
I'm giving up my arm here.

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,650
I was just about to tell you

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,050
that this one arm might not be enough.

78
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,240
Didn't you just say

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
you only needed one arm?

80
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,730
I got a little

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,170
carried away with my drawing.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,170
What do you mean?

83
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,490
Not enough space.

84
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,120
How much more do you need?

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,170
Lend me your back.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,760
He Ran, you're doing this on purpose.

87
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,680
It's done. Check it out.

88
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm paralysed. I can't move.

89
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,610
Then I'll carry you.

90
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,850
What do you think?

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,880
It's beautiful.

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,560
How does it compare
to what you expected?

93
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,970
It's even more stunning.

94
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,290
Do you think it's worthwhile

95
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,490
to sacrifice yourself for art now?

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,050
I'm wondering

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
how I'm going to shower like this.

98
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,120
Of course you can't take a shower.

99
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,050
The paint will wash away, so no.

100
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,360
What if I sweat?

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Sweating is fine.

102
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,490
I don't mind.

103
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,930
Are you sure you don't mind?

104
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,850
What are you doing?

105
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,410

174
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,210
Did you forget?

175
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,300
We have an appointment with
Mr. Wang to discuss financing.

176
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,900
I've confirmed with you.

177
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,300
You wait for me outside.

178
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,620
I'll be out soon.

179
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,210
Okay.

180
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,140
(Zhang Yuanqi)

181
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,490
Mrs. Qiu, regarding the decline

182
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,340
in the percentage of
online sales of subsidiary brands,

183
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,290
the business department

184
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,450
has collected information

185
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,530
on several sales platforms

186
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,530
and conducted a study on

187
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,530
representative customers
as you suggested.

188
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,660
Now

189
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,210
the big data analysis report is out.

190
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,450
The apparent cause
for this is because of

191
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,140
the decline in support
from the platform.

192
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,180
Some customers are more

193
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,140
price sensitive after
the unit price has risen.

194
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,620
However, the fundamental reason

195
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,060
is the same as your previous judgement,

196
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,730
that is, at this stage we have

197
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,060
too many different product lines

198
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
and not enough clear positioning.

199
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,450
The price sensitivity of
the lower end of the market

200
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,340
is particularly high when

201
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,860
the mid to high-end line
is not yet available.

202
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,900
For example, Aubrey, Maida

203
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,010
and Triple Play

204
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,530
are also entering
the lower end of the market

205
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,900
with their price wars.

206
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,900
They have an advantage over us

207
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,250
in terms of supply chain costs

208
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,690
and the price of raw materials.

209
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,580
There's also

210
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,580
a new staff orientation next week

211
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,820
that you'll need to attend.

212
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,210
This will be followed by

213
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,900
a welcome meal for new staff.

214
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,930
Will you be going?

215
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,180
Mrs. Qiu, will you?

216
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,970
Yes.

217
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,060
Why not?

218
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,490
Okay, then I'll arrange
the schedule for you.

219
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,420
Xiao Han.

220
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,530
Why don't you sweep with a broom?

221
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,690
How troublesome it is
to pick them up one by one.

222
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,100
I've put a lot of effort into it,

223
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
but they still don't survive.

224
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,690
It's really upsetting.

225
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,450
If I sweep them, they break easily.

226
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,970
I wanted to make their sacrifice

227
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,060
a little more dignified.

228
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,970
I have a way.

229
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,490
Give me a petal.

230
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,100
Look.

231
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,530
We'll paste all the petals on

232
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,180
and take them

233
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,770
to the studio where
I used to work part-time.

234
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
The studio has a special tool

235
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,970
that allows it to be vacuumed.

236
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,970
This way, the painting

237
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,530
can be preserved forever,

238
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,100
together with your favourite flowers.

239
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,770
Isn't it pretty?

249
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,420
Xiao Han, our bathroom is too small.

250
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,620
There's not even a bathtub.

251
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,820
Why do you need a bathtub?
I don't need it.

252
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,970
I need one.

253
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,930
Will you be free tomorrow?

254
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,730
How about you take me out on a date?

255
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,100
Hosta is

256
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,010
a brand with a philosophy of quality,

257
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,490
natural products

258
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
and healthy eating.

259
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,140
As the industry leader

260
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,210
and pioneer of

261
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,420
ready-to-eat products

262
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,730
that are low in oil,

263
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,210
salt and sugar,

264
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,420
we are committed to...

265
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,620
Excuse me.

266
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,450
We are committed to

267
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,380
natural and healthy ingredients

268
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,010
from China, Australia,

269
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,250
New Zealand

270
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,140
and around the world,

271
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,450
providing consumers around the world

272
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,060
with more gourmet,

273
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,010
more delicious and healthier products.

274
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,490
I am a beneficiary of this philosophy

275
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,580
and a faithful

276
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,770
practitioner of it.

277
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,770
Mrs. Qiu, what's wrong?

278
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,530
Nothing.

279
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,770
That's it for today.

280
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,250
Get back to your work.

281
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,290
We have a company dinner tonight

282
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,970
to welcome our new employees.

283
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,210
Luo said

284
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,860
we can discuss what to eat

285
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,290
and she will make the arrangements.

286
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,860
There are many of us.
Let's have hotpot.

287
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,450
That's all the more reason not to.

288
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,380
It will be so noisy
that we can't even talk.

289
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,620
How about Japanese food?

290
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,580
But there doesn't seem to be

291
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,180
any good Japanese
restaurants around here.

292
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,180
The traffic is also heavy
during rush hour. So forget it.

293
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,140
That's true.

294
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,380
We'll be wasting time on the road.

295
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,010
I suggest we find

296
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,010
a decent place

297
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,380
with a nice ambiance downstairs.

298
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,180
Didn't you say you used to

299
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,180
intern near this building?

300
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,060
So you should know this area well.

301
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,730
There's a new
fried chicken place downstairs

302
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,010
that serves a generous portion.

303
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,530
I think it's not bad.

304
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,450
Have you tried it?

305
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,530
No,

306
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,060
but it should be not bad.

307
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,420
I've always wanted to try it.

308
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,900
- Hello, Mrs. Qiu.
- Hello, Mrs. Qiu.

309
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,010
Hello, Mrs. Qiu.

310
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,530
Make another copy for me.

311
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
By the way, Mrs. Qiu,

312
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,210
we are discussing

313
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,340
where to meet for dinner tonight.

314
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,730
Do you have time?

315
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,180
How about a fried chicken restaurant?

316
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,490
I can't believe you guys are
talking about this during work hours.

317
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,860
Go without me. I'm not free.

318
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,140
(Executive office)

319
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,010
Are you stupid?

320
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,660
Mrs. Qiu will never eat fried chicken.

321
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,210
She is our company's

322
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,820
health expert

323
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,490
and is a leading organic health

324
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,450
food blogger.

325
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,770
If she eats fried chicken,

326
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,820
her image will be tarnished.

327
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,690
So? Have you guys decided what to eat?

328
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Yes.

329
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,660
What is it?

330
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,100
- Fried chicken.
- Fried chicken.

331
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,250
- Fried chicken?
- Yes.

332
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,290
Aren't you afraid of gaining weight?

333
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,380
Yuanqi suggested it.

334
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,010
Okay, fried chicken then.

335
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,250
Here you go.

336
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,290
Okay, thanks.

337
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,340
Coffees are here.

338
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,140
- Who wants coffee?
- Thanks.

339
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,820
New colleague, eat more.

340
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,490
Thanks.

341
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,140
Everyone, enjoy your food and drink.

342
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,490
It's on me, okay?

343
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,210
Thank you, Luo.

344
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,420
Let's split the bill.

345
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,100
Make yourself at home.

346
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,250
Thank you.

347
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,860
Eat more.

348
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,730
Thanks.

349
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,580
I want to eat squid rings.

350
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,970
- I like it.
- This?

351
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,420
There's a new
fried chicken place downstairs

352
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,730
that serves a generous portion.

353
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
I think it's not bad.

354
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,410
Why would he mention going
to a fried chicken place?

355
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,130
Was it on purpose?

356
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,610
I must keep him quiet.

357
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,570
Mrs. Qiu.

358
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,330
- Hello, Mrs. Qiu.
- Hello, Mrs. Qiu.

359
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,410
- Mrs. Qiu.
- Eat up.

360
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,610
Hello, Mrs. Qiu.

361
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,220
You are here.

362
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,090
Sit here.

363
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,890
Yuanqi, pass a wet wipe to Mrs. Qiu.

364
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,460
No need.

365
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,330
Mrs. Qiu, what would you like to eat?

366
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,090
Salad is fine.

367
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,890
Mrs. Qiu, black coffee

368
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
without milk and sugar.

369
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,540
Thanks.

370
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,090
We're guessing that you're a healthy

371
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,410
and conscientious eater.

372
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,300
You don't eat high-calorie foods

373
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,540
like fried chicken.

374
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,850
Yes.

375
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,890
Yuanqi.

376
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,650
I think you look familiar.

377
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,890
Luo, does every handsome man

378
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,220
look familiar to you?

379
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,940
I didn't mean to hit on him.

380
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,170
I really think he looks familiar.

381
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,980
My last internship was in this building.

382
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,650
You might have seen me at work.

383
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,330
I knew it.

384
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,220
Then again, he is memorable

385
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,220
because he is handsome.

386
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,850
Thousands of employees go in and out

387
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,090
of this building every day.

388
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,740
If it wasn't for his good looks,

389
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,890
how could you remember?

390
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,220
Fine. I admit it.

391
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,980
Handsome guy.

392
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,330
Mrs. Qiu, does he look familiar to you?

393
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,170
Do you think
Zhang Yuanqi looks familiar?

394
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Why do you ask?

395
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,890
I just said that
Zhang Yuanqi looked familiar

396
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,060
and they laughed at me,

397
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
saying it was because he was
handsome that I remembered him.

398
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,980
He actually

399
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,500
used to work in our building.

400
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,020
It is likely that
we have encountered him

401
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,570
in and out of the building.

402
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,810
They want to know

403
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,130
if you have met him before.

404
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,740
No, I never met him.

405
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,540
Yuanqi.

406
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
Then have you ever met Mrs. Qiu?

407
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,220
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

408
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,540
Wait. You haven't answered yet.

409
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
Did I say something wrong just now?

410
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,890
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

411
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,300
Who are you?

412
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,330
The Light Practice application

413
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,460
is a top-class online

414
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,740
lifestyle application.

415
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,540
This is also the first time they have

416
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,650
collaborated with an external brand.

417
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,740
So Zhang Yue's team is still

418
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,650
in charge of the online execution.

419
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,890
Li Ruiyi, Hu Tong.

420
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
Your two groups will
coordinate and support.

421
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,650
Give me the proposal by Friday.

422
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,570
Any problems?

423
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,940
No, no problem.

424
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,890
Mrs. Qiu, rest assured.

425
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,740
We have been working on the project

426
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,060
since we were in the planning stage.

427
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,890
At the moment we have put together

428
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,220
three good directions

429
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,780
which we will refine
further down the line.

430
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,460
The proposal will be ready

431
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,700
for your decision at
Wednesday's meeting.

432
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,370
Okay.

433
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,410
Zhang Yuanqi will be in charge

434
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,980
of the overall planning, execution

435
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,260
and follow-up of this offline event.

436
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,540
Including the location of
the entrance to the site,

437
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,370
the location of the exhibition stand,
the flow of crowds,

438
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,090
the related brand shops,

439
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,850
consumer research,

440
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,780
the preparation of publicity materials,

441
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,850
the LED screens, the design

442
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,170
and production of roll-up banners,

443
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,130
the writing of publicity releases,

444
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,740
the major platforms including

445
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,700
our official website, Weibo, WeChat

446
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,850
and the major portals,

447
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,980
advance promotion and publicity

448
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,060
are all under the charge
of you, Zhang Yuanqi.

449
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,810
Give me a planning proposal

450
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,650
by the end of the day tomorrow

451
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,130
and a specific
implementation plan for next week

452
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,060
by Wednesday.

453
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,090
Will I be responsible
for all this myself?

454
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,260
Yes.

455
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,060
Any problems?

456
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,220
Mrs. Qiu, Yuanqi is new here.

457
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,810
He doesn't know much about
all aspects of the new product yet.

458
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,610
- I can...
- Your tasks are not heavy, right?

459
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,570
Then get it to me by
the end of the day on Monday.

460
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,020
Monday?

461
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,980
Today?

462
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,090
Yes, today.

463
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,370
Anyone else has any questions?

464
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,890
- No more.
- No problem.

465
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,330
Meeting adjourned.

466
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,810
What's going on?

467
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,300
Does Mrs. Qiu have a grudge against you?

468
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,890
No.

469
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,700
She's clearly giving you a hard time.

470
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,410
The tasks you've been given

471
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,220
would be difficult even for veterans,

472
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,700
let alone a newcomer.

473
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,330
Your group of new recruits

474
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,850
are KPI appraisal

475
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,980
bottom feeders.

476
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,260
This is

477
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,370
a clear attempt to force you out.

478
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,930
I'll try my best.

479
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,930
What will you do after work later?

480
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,300
It's a dash.

481
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,380
Poor him.

482
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,580
Let's go to a restaurant
in the west of town.

483
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,100
Okay.

484
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,820
Come here. Slow down.

485
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,820
Come here.

486
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,620
I'll give you a kiss.

487
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,100
My babies.

488
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,300
Let's hug.

489
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,970
Look at them.

490
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,930
They are having fun.

491
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,300
Be careful.

492
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,620
Don't fall.

493
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,210
Sister.

494
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:43,970
Be careful.

495
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,620
Why hasn't Yuanqi come down yet?

496
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,650
I'll call him.

497
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,860
Let's eat.

498
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,300
Licheng, come and eat.

499
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,540
Come on down.

500
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,820
It's time to eat, busy man.

501
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,650
Eat without me. I'm not hungry.

502
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,540
Again?

503
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,900
You can't eat instant noodles anymore.

504
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,690
It's bad for your body.

505
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,550
Okay, thank you.

506
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,390
Why are you being so polite?
I'm your sister.

507
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,070
What's wrong with Qi? Still not eating?

508
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,500
He'll be down later.

509
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,790
We've called him many times

510
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,790
and he still hasn't come down.

511
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,940
He has been in the room
for two days and two nights.

512
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,390
Will he be fine?

513
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,700
He's busy with work.

514
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,740
- Let's eat first.
- What is he busy with?

515
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,700
Can he make a fortune?

516
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,980
- Of course.
- He doesn't even eat his meal.

517
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,310
He'll make a fortune.

518
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,110
Let's eat first.

Mrs. Qiu, this is the project proposal
made by the new staff.

521
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,560
Take a look.

522
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,600
Okay.

523
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,490
I got it.

524
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,450
You may leave.

525
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,200
Okay.

527
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,560
Guys, have you received the email?

528
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,200
Yes.

529
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,010
- Yes.
- Yes.

530
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,600
I got it.

531
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,370
Got it, Luo.

(Utility room)

533
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,680
Come in.

534
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,410
Yes?

535
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,930
Coffee for you.

536
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,850
If it's convenient for you,

537
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,890
I'd like to talk to you.

538
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,720
What do you want
to talk about? Have a seat.

539
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,450
Mrs. Qiu, I think there is

540
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,330
some misunderstanding between us.

541
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,930
I mean the matter in the utility room.

542
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,410
I'm here to apologise.

543
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,890
I hope I did not offend you.

544
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,810
It was a coincidence
that I came to this company.

545
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,720
In fact,

546
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,050
I received an offer from Hosta

547
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,560
before I met you.

548
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,050
I cherish this job.

549
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,600
I hope I can do well.

550
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,450
What's your point?

551
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,450
Do you think I'm trying to
make things difficult for you?

552
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,080
Just because you've seen
my ugly side before

553
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,600
and then I ran into you at work,

554
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,050
I'm afraid you will expose my secret,

555
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,970
so I'm taking revenge on you?

556
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,490
I hope that's not the case.

557
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,200
You're overthinking it.

558
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,720
Of course not.

No.

I've done three versions
of an executive proposal.

564
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,810
Yes, I have.

They are not okay.

567
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,970
Here's a reminder.

568
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,530
Our company has
an elimination system for KPIs

569
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,680
at the end of the probationary period.

570
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,120
If you don't do your job well,

571
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,810
the company won't keep you,

572
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,810
coincidentally or not.

573
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,160
Understand?

574
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:36,930
Yes.

575
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,720
I will resign on my own initiative.

576
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,080
Pardon me.

577
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,930
Better off on your own.

May I know how to
get to Xiaozhou Village?

You are here.

581

Thank you.
