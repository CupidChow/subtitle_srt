00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,350
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

4
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,420
- Ranran.
- Happy birthday.

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,040
Come on.

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,790
Here.

7
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,430
Let's eat.

8
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,350
Umbrella.

9
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,070
The road was slippery.

10
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,680
I accidentally slipped.

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,630
Let me send you off.

12
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,920
(I really want to see him,)

13
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,070
(but I'm stuck at home)

14
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,480
(and can't go anywhere.)

15
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,350
Ranran,

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,070
what are you thinking about?
You're distracted from your meal.

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,350
Don't you have a charity show tomorrow?

18
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,390
Where will it be?

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,280
At the music festival.

20
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,480
My nephew

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,390
started a band a while back

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,390
and he's the lead singer.

23
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,830
Mother,

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,230
I'm not feeling well.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,550
So I'll go upstairs to rest.

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,760
Enjoy the meal.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you all right?

28
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,830
Are you anemic again?

29
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,830
Yu.

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,280
Go and see her.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,280
Didn't you prepare a gift for Ran?

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
You're right.

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,760
Go ahead.

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,510
He Ran, open the door.

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,110
I am sleeping.

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,070
Stop kidding me.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,480
I can hear the music playing.

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm about to sleep.

39
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,350
Why do you sleep
in the middle of the day?

40
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,600
It's my afternoon nap.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,320
He Ran, open the door.

42
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,880
I really want to sleep.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,070
Won't you open the door?

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,490
Hi.

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,920
Get out.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,070
No,

47
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
unless you promise

48
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,630
to watch my performance tomorrow.

49
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,230
What performance?

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,480
Seriously?

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,390
I just mentioned it during the meal.

52
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,760
Fine, He Ran.

53
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,320
You never

54
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,950
take anything I say seriously, do you?

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:55,950
Hold on.

56
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,760
Who are you drawing?

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
None of your business.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,280
Let me ask you again.

59
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,440
Will you go to my
band's performance tomorrow?

60
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,480
(I have an idea.)

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,670
Okay.

62
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I'll go.

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,550
Really?

64
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,750
I wasn't feeling well just now.

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,960
So I didn't quite get it.

66
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm feeling better now.

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I said I will go.

68
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,670
I really don't understand

69
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,720
you women.

70
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,230
Your attitude changes every time.

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,990
Still,

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,280
I didn't force you.

73
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,750
You agreed to go yourself.

74
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,640
Come and pick me up tomorrow.

75
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,110
Okay.

76
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,790
This is my birthday present to you.

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,160
Happy birthday.

78
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,840
I'll get going.

79
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,230
Forget it. I'll go through
the front door.

80
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,640
(I'll get out of the house with Han Yu)

81
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,040
(and figure out what
to do once I'm out.)

82
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,430
What took you so long?

83
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,040
You look handsome today.

84
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,750
You have good taste.

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
This is

86
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,040
a couture piece.

87
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,870
It's not even available
in our country yet.

88
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,670
I pre-ordered it for
a year before I got it.

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,280
Do you mean
Changhong Street Night Market?

90
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,080
Is the store so popular?

91
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,040
I can't believe you
have to wait a year.

92
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,160
What...

93
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,110
Night market?

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,230
Mine is

95
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,160
real couture.

96
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,430
This is RMB5 a metre, right?

97
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,080
It tends to fade and is of poor quality.

98
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,920
Yours is in good condition
and has diamonds.

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,600
It should be RMB10 a metre.

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,790
As I said,

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,750
this is couture.

102
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes, they can make it high-class.

103
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,280
You can have your
initials engraved on it

104
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,600
for an additional RMB20,

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,110
but I think

106
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,430
it's really tacky.

107
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,550
(HY)
You didn't carve it, did you?

108
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,350
(HY)
No, I didn't.

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,080
Of course I didn't.

110
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,670
How stupid is it to carve a name.

111
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,430
Exactly.

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
All right. Get in the car.

113
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,280
Mind your head.

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,190
It hurts.

115
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,110
Your hair.

116
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,480
- My hair.
- Your hair.

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,040
You strangled my hair.
Why are you shouting?

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,670
I don't want you to get hurt.

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,230
It hurts enough. Don't move.

120
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
How can I help you?

121
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,400
Lower your back.

122
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,480
See? I am smart enough

123
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,520
to come up with that one.

124
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,920
Childish.

125
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,620
(ISLAND)

126
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,920
What about it?

127
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,350
You've never been to

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,310
a place like this before, right?

129
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,670
Listen,

130
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,480
you should come out with me more often.

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,110
I promise to show you the world.

132
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,640
It's crowded here.

133
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,310
Stay close.

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,110
(Strictly staff only)
Don't get lost.

135
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,430
(Strictly staff only)

136
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,280
(Strictly staff only)
Sorry.

137
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,750
(Strictly staff only)

138
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,790
(Strictly staff only)
Outsiders are prohibited from entering.

139
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,640
(Strictly staff only)

140
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,190
Who told you that she is an outsider?

141
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,430
Outsider?

142
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,870
If she's not an outsider,

143
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
then who is she?

144
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,400
A fan, I guess.

145
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Cut the nonsense.

146
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,520
His lady friend.

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,160
Let's go.

148
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,720
Come on.

149
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,080
Please come in.

150
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,840
Why is your lady friend so quiet?

151
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,160
Introduce her to us.

152
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,930
- Yes.
- Exactly.

153
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,620
- Yes, introduce her.
- Exactly.

154
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,280
Introduce her.

155
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,350
Stop it.

156
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
Are you guys so idle?

157
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,040
Hey, why do you keep reading this?

158
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,670
The man on it is right in front of you.

159
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,640
Give it back.

160
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,960
Get ready. It's time.

161
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,160
Okay.

162
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,670
I want to go to the bathroom.

163
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,080
What?

164
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,550
Why didn't you say it earlier?

165
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,920
The show is about to begin.

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I suddenly have the urge to go.

167
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,470
You're so fussy.

168
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,710
Why do you always
look for the bathroom first?

169
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,760
I'll be right back.

170
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,040
Yu, let her be.

171
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,120
We're here to perform.

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
Wait a minute.

173
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,550
Liu.

174
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,880
This beauty needs to go to the bathroom.

175
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,880
When she returns,

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,520
bring her to the front row.

177
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,550
I've saved her a super VIP seat.

178
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,190
Okay?

179
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,120
Okay. Don't worry.

180
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,310
- Leave her to me.
- Okay.

181
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,360
See you later.

182
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,950
Get back soon.

183
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,040
It's starting soon.

184
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,920
Let's go, Yu.

185
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,360
- She won't run off.
- Come on.

186
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,710
The exit.

187
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,760
The flea market.

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,790
Right side of the car park.

189
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,590
The southeast gate of the park.

190
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,000
Xiaozhou Village.

191
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,120
Ms. He.

192
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,160
Ms. He.

193
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,430
Are you leaving?

194
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,280
No.

195
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,310
I'm going to the stage.

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,920
You're going the wrong way.

197
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,520
The show is over here.

198
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,400
Come with me.

199
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,830
Let's go.

200
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,660
(The one and only Yu)

201
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,070
Hello, everyone. We are Island.

202
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,020
(ISLAND)

203
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
He is looking at you.

204
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,670
Really.

205
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,000
I am the lead singer, Han Yu.

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,640
He is really looking at you.

207
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,550
Do you know each other?

208
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,760
I don't know him..

209
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,310
No?

210
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,920
(Yu is the best!)
Are you ready?

211
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,860
(Yu is the best!)

212
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,120
Take out your phone and take a picture.

213
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
What picture?

214
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,160
Picture to post on Moments.

215
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,590
How else would people
know you're here for the show?

216
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,590
That makes sense.

217
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,950
Han Yu!

218
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,280
Han Yu!

219
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,430
Han Yu!

220
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,880
(I need to find a place
get changed first.)

221
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,940
(ISLAND)

222
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,070
Have you seen He Ran?

223
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,120
I guess she's watching the show outside.

224
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,000
Didn't you interact with her just now?

225
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,830
I only saw her for
two seconds in the opening.

226
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,880
Then I didn't see her again.

227
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,120
She's not answering either.

228
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,120
Don't worry. It's so noisy outside.

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,710
She probably can't hear her phone.

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,670
Where is he going?

231
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,240
What's the urgency?

232
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,590
It's not like she ran off.

233
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,120
Han Yu.

234
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,160
Can I take a photo with you?

235
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
I like you for a long time.

236
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,590
Yu.

237
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,120
What's your hurried?

238
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,280
Where's He Ran?

239
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,120
She ran off.

240
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,160
What?

241
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,300
(Hairdressing)

242
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,280
What's your name?

243
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,950
Mimi.

244
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,060
Let me draw you a picture.

246

Nice drawing.

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're back.

257
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,880
What do you do for a living?

258
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
I am a teacher.

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I've been teaching at
a nearby studio for years.

260
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,470
I'm here to return your umbrella,

261
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,520
but I didn't...

262
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,430
You don't have to return
the broken umbrella.

263
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,000
I still have to.

264
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,950
Anything else?

265
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,670
I need

266
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,040
- a hair wash.
- Xiao.

267
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,790
I bought fried rice noodles.

268
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,880
Let's eat together.

269
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,360
You look familiar.

270
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,830
Have we met somewhere?

271
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,360
She is the lady who
came before for a hair wash.

272
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,880
Oh, yes.

273
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,160
I remember.

274
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,400
So?

275
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,920
Do you need his service?

276
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,400
Enjoy your dinner.

277
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll get going.

278
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,670
Why is she leaving?

279
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,540
♪Embracing while sinking♪

280
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,760
Xiao, this is from your favourite restaurant.

281
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,790
To be honest,

282
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,920
our performance yesterday

283
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
was a great success.

284
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,950
So, how was my high note?

285
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,950
Impressive, right?

286
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,830
- It sounded heavenly.
- Yes.

287
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,190
Your high note is just incredible.

288
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,040
And my ending pose.

289
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,360
Cool, right?

290
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,400
Well...

291
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,000
Teach us more.

292
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,520
- Yes.
- How did you do it?

293
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
Let us learn from you.

294
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,240
Right.

295
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,430
Yu.

296
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,470
Are you waiting for He Ran's call?

297
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,830
Go away.

298
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,950
I told you not to mention her name.

299
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,160
She pisses me off every day.

300
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,000
He Ran.

301
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,920
Are you stupid?

302
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,640
Didn't you hear what Yu said?

303
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,830
Don't mention that witch.

304
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,120
Who are you to call her that?

305
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,360
Yu.

306
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,360
That witch... I mean,

307
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,360
He Ran is here.

308
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,310
He Ran?

309
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,830
- Yu.
- Take it easy.

310
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,310
Don't be impulsive.

311
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
Impulsiveness is evil.

312
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,430
Get out.

313
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,400
Well...

314
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,920
Where did you go?

315
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,070
Didn't I ask you to
wait for me at backstage?

316
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,310
Why didn't you answer my calls?

317
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,880
Listen.

318
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,430
I fell because of you.

319
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,710
You are responsible for it.

320
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,400
You have so many questions.

321
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,790
Which one should I answer first?

322
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,710
Well...

323
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,470
Did you

324
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,710
run off with someone else?

325
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,280
What are you talking about?

326
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
Who could I run with?

327
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,550
Then,

328
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,830
where did you go?

329
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,240
I was there all
the time to hear you sing.

330
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,070
It was so loud

331
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,590
I didn't hear your calls.

332
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,710
See for yourself.

333
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,190
I also recorded a video.

334
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,430
I was going to post it
on Moments tonight.

335
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,550
I will tag you as well.

336
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,400
Really?

337
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,640
Yes. See for yourself.

338
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,520
See?

339
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,470
Gee...

340
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,710
You...

341
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,790
What did you record?
You are so bad at this.

342
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
You got me all crooked.

343
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,710
I look so ugly.

344
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
I can't believe you.

345
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,030
It's not my fault.

346
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,030
With so many fans

347
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,670
crowding the scene,

348
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,670
I did pretty well
with these shots, right?

349
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,470
Indeed.

350
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,560
I do have a lot of fans.

351
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,510
Yes, you are so popular,

352
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,400
right?

353
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,400
So,

354
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,510
how was my singing?

355
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,190
Then I'll take you

356
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,230
to my next concert.

357
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,230
Ranran.

358
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,880
- Ma'am.
- Mother.

359
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,470
Yu.

360
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,270
Are you all right?

361
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm fine.

362
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,800
It's just a minor scratch.

363
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,710
It'll recover in a few days.

364
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,190
This flower...

365
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,840
Don't move.

366
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,710
I'll do it.

367
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,750
Thank you, ma'am.

368
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,160
It's a slow recovery.

369
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,510
You must be extra careful.

370
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,080
Be careful on the road.

371
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,640
Ranran, where have you been?

372
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,840
Han Yu searched for you everywhere
and got into an accident.

373
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,470
Madam, I was mistaken.

374
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,950
He Ran was there the whole time.

375
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,360
Maybe it was too noisy and
she didn't hear the phone.

376
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,470
She even recorded a video of me live.

377
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,950
- Yes.
- She has become my fan now.

378
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,750
Han Yu is a good singer.

379
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,360
Really?

380
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,230
Look at this video.

381
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,710
Is this Han Yu?

382
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Next to that one.

383
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,470
The middle one.

384
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,800
The centre.

385
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,920
Yes.

386
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,360
This is a small token
of our appreciation.

387
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,270
Thank you for being such a great help.

388
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
I can't take this.

389
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,470
I just happened to be driving by

390
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,080
and offered a hand.

391
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
I can't accept this money.

392
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,710
I heard you mentioned

393
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,800
that you work in construction, right?

394
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Not really.

395
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,990
Well,

396
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,920
I just work with my boss
on some small projects,

397
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,750
like landscaping, greening and so on.

398
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,030
By the way,

399
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,320
if you need my service,

400
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,670
come and see me anytime.

401
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,750
This is my name card.

402
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,360
I guarantee to get
the job done for you.

403
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,750
We really appreciate your help.

404
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,640
His sister-in-law moved in with me

405
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,750
to discipline him.

406
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,400
Han Yu is so careless.

407
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,030
You should also be careful

408
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,470
in case of bumps and bruises.

409
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,430
It's no joke.

410
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
What's wrong?

411
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,120
Why did you stop?

412
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,030
Nothing.

413
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,710
Mother.

414
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,470
Don't you have to go
to Nancheng for work?

415
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,470
Why don't you go first?

416
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,080
I'll stay at the hospital with Han Yu.

417
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
He was hurt because of me.

418
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,360
I don't want him

419
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
to be in a bad mood.

420
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,950
When did you and Han Yu become so close?

421
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,080
I'm glad to hear that.

422
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,430
If you like him,

423
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,950
you two should get along.

424
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,120
I will also be at ease.

425
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,030
Besides, Han Yu is not

426
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,270
like those kids out there
who don't know their roots.

427
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,640
Mrs. Han has been kind
to our family, too.

428
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,270
All right, mother. I got it.

429
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,030
I'll go and accompany him.

430
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,640
Go home early.

431
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,470
I will ask the driver to pick you up.

432
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,510
It's okay.

433
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,320
I'll ask Han Yu's driver to send me.

434
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,510
Then you two have fun.

435
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,950
I'll get going, mother.

436
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,320
Hello?

437
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,360
Where are you?

438
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,920
(Fatty)

439
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,750
Fatty.

440
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,190
Hey, why are you here?

441
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,030
Are you sick?

442
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,030
That's not it.

443
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,640
Do you know those two people just now?

444
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
Those two?

445
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,800
Nah,

446
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,030
how could I possibly know them?

447
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,510
Look at the way they dress

448
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,160
and the way they talk.

449
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,560
They're not the same
kind of people as us.

450
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
I just met them today.

451
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,470
How did you guys meet?

452
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,990
It's a long story.

453
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,710
I was

454
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,600
driving down the road to buy groceries

455
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,920
for my wife's restaurant today

456
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,560
and there was a guy on
a motorbike in front of me,

457
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
showing off.

458
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,230
I knew he'd fall.

459
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,670
As soon as he turned the corner,

460
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,640
he fell into the ditch.

461
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,510
I was having a blast

462
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,750
and about to take
a picture. Then I said,

463
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,080
hey, he has no move.

464
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,120
So I rushed out of the car to see.

465
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,270
He was pinned down by the motorbike.

466
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
So I sent him to this hospital.

467
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,510
It turned out that

468
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,270
those two people are
relatives of the young man.

469
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,430
They thanked me

470
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,160
and wanted to repay me.

471
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,600
But I did it for a good cause.

472
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,270
It's not worth mentioning.

473
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,190
Then,

474
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,990
they offered me a red packet.

475
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,030
This thick.

476
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,120
I rejected them.

477
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,320
Now that I think about it,

478
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,880
I regret it.

479
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,990
I should have taken it.

480
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,710
I reckon there are

481
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,710
probably tens
of thousands in there.

482
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,400
Are you hungry?

483
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,160
I am.

484
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,470
Let's grab some food.

485
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,670
It's my treat.

486
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,920
Okay.

487
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,560
Hi,

488
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,430
two bowls of porridge and
two sets of golden lava buns.

489
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,160
Be quick.

490
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,920
Okay.

491
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,920
The golden lava bun here

492
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
is stuffed with extra filling.

493
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,160
And the porridge

494
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,560
is so creamy.

495
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,950
You can try it later.

496
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,710
Here.

497
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,600
All right.

498
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,230
Please enjoy.

499
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,360
Thank you.

500
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,800
Eat up.

501
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,560
Well,

502
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,750
I've been talking about me.

503
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,990
You haven't said much about you.

504
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,230
Why were you in the hospital?

505
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,430
Are you sick?

506
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,360
No, I was there to visit a friend.

507
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,470
I haven't seen you for a while.

508
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,640
Haven't you been to
Xiaozhou Village lately?

509
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,710
No.

510
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,190
I teach art at the studio there.

511
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Teach?

512
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,920
You're a teacher?

513
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,360
I thought you were a student.

514
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,510
You're really young and talented.

515
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,270
Then you can take your students

516
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,120
to my wife's restaurant

517
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,470
after your regular classes.

518
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,030
The portions are large,
economical and affordable.

519
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,320
Anyway,

520
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,880
Xiao Han always goes there for lunch.

521
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,990
Does Xiao Han go there
every day at lunchtime?

522
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,080
You got excited when I mentioned him.

523
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,120
Don't get me wrong.

524
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,470
Xiao Han

525
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
has a girlfriend.

526
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,190
Girlfriend?

527
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,990
You know,

528
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,030
the tall one

529
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,920
with long, curly hair

530
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,230
and a nice figure,

531
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,800
who goes to his house
for a meal everyday.

532
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,230
Everyday?

533
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,190
No way.

534
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,470
He doesn't take care of his meals.

535
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,710
He always eats at my wife's restaurant.

536
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,430
Are you talking about Man?

537
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,270
I guess so.

538
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,800
She is not Xiao's girlfriend.

539
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,990
You can say she's the landlady.

540
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,840
- Landlady?
- Yes.

541
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,080
Man's salon

542
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,990
was left to her by her grandfather.

543
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,710
Xiao is renting there

544
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,950
and looking after the salon.

545
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,560
Man, she's a bit of a loafer.

546
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,800
She likes wandering around

547
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,190
and hang out at Xiao's
place when she is free.

548
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,190
Don't worry.

549
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,470
They are not dating.

550
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,710
Are you happy now?

551
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,990
So

552
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,320
Xiao Han is not
a professional hairdresser.

553
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,640
Of course not.

554
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,360
That old rundown salon

555
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,600
is not usually visited by outsiders.

556
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,160
It's the regular customers
in the neighbourhood,

557
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,400
the seniors,

558
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,800
who don't want to spend money outside

559
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,430
go to that salon.

560
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,430
Xiao Han

561
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,920
gave me a haircut.

562
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,230
What?

563
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,080
It looks good.

564
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,750
Xiao has a real knack when it comes to

565
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,190
knives and scissors.

566
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,920
Come on, eat!

567
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,320
If you are free, you can
go around the central lake.

568
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,640
You can meet him there by chance.

569
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,950
Xiao Han.

570
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,230
I think I lost your umbrella.

571
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,190
Can I pay you back with this one?

572
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,750
Go and sit over there.

573
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,990
It's okay. I'm not hot.

574
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,120
Just go.

575
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,920
I'll lend you my umbrella.

576
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,920
It's too scorching.

577
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,320
I can't work while holding it.

578
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,400
I'll help you.

579
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,840
You do your work.
I'll stand beside you.

580
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Just go.

581
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,080
I'll meet you there

582
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,800
when I'm done.

583
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
All right then.

Why are you frozen?

605
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,190
Getting woozy because of the heat?

606
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,230
No.

607
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,990
Let's go.

608
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,640
Are you done with your work?

609
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,990
I have to do the whole garden.

610
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,990
I can't finish it today.

611
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,600
What about you?

612
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,840
I'll come over early tomorrow
to continue the work.

613
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,510
It's so hot today.

614
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,710
You're going to get heatstroke.

615
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,400
I'm fine.

616
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,360
When will you come over tomorrow?

617
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,800
Shall I come and keep you company?

618
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Are you so free?

619
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,990
Don't you have classes?

620
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,670
I have.

621
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,470
My job is to draw.

622
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,470
I found this place so beautiful

623
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,920
with the flowers, the grass,
the white house

624
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,800
and the sea.

625
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,670
I'll bring my students over
do some drawing

626
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,470
and get the class done.

627
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,840
Do as you wish.

628
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,840
I see you're working too hard here.

629
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,120
Aren't you tired?

630
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,030
I'm used to it.

631
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,990
It's just an odd job.

632
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,670
We are recently

633
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,080
recruiting models for our studio.

634
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,510
Do you want to join us?

635
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,670
Wages are paid daily at RMB50 per hour.

636
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,560
I have no experience.

637
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,560
It's okay.

638
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,840
No experience required.

639
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,510
All you have to do is sit there
and let them draw.

640
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,030
Can anyone be a model?

641
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,950
Exactly.

642
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,360
Then why not just draw you?

643
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,120
There is no requirement to be a model,

644
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,430
but there is a standard

645
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,430
to be a quality model.

646
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,920
You see, I'm plain

647
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,120
and boring to the students,

648
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,230
but you're different.

649
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,400
Your features are more defined.

650
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,230
Their drawings

651
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,670
will be more visually appealing.

652
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,670
They will also be happier

653
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,670
and more interested in
drawing handsome men.

654
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,990
Forget it.

655
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,320
You know what?

656
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,670
Our studio

657
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,920
is very nice,

658
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,080
with air conditioning, fruit,

659
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,510
snacks and milk tea.

660
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,080
You will never be tired.

661
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,990
Besides,

662
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,950
I am a kind-hearted person

663
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,750
and have no selfish motives.

664
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,030
I just feel that

665
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,640
your job is too tough.

666
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,230
But if you don't want to,

667
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,920
I'll find someone else.

668
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,920
It's getting late

669
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,120
and I have a class tomorrow.

670
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
What shall I do?

671
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,710
Fine.

672
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,510
Why don't you leave your number

673
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,990
and we'll keep in touch?

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,320
See you tomorrow.

685
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,990
(Next episode)
if you could still

686
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,470
(Next episode)
be the model in the next class.

687
