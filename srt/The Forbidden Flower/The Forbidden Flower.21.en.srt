Okay.

46
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,220
Too many words.

47

Just blame the carpet.

103
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,790
The quality of the carpet is too low.

104
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,320
There's too much static electricity.

105
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,350
It sparkled

106
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,150

Luckily I reacted in time.

That's it. Look.

109
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,870
Nothing in the house was burnt.

110
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,510
This is ridiculous.

111
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,670
It's okay.

112
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,240
It's fine as long as no one was hurt.

113
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,870
I didn't do it on purpose.

114
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,670
I think

115
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,430
Yu should

116
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,390
stop looking for Ranran.

117
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,510
Ranran's sickness has just stabilised.

118
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,710
She was frightened by you.

119
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,040
She's not frightened.

120
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,190
She put off the fire.

121
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,470
Really.

122
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,430
Stop causing trouble.

123
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,150
You keep causing trouble.

124
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,590
Luckily, today was a false alarm.

125
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,310
If you've harmed He Ran,

126
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,660
you can't even compensate
with your life.

127
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,430
No.

128
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,990
He Ran is not safe living alone.

129
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,670
I'm here to take care of her.

130
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,710
Yes.

131
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,790
Yu is kind-hearted.

132
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,620
It's good that he can stay by
Ranran's side.

133
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,580
If anything happens,

134
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,910
there's someone helping her.

135
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,950
I want to go back and
stay in the campus.

136
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,910
Since you're worried

137
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,950
that I'm staying alone,

138
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,800

you're having a long holiday.

142
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,070
Yes.

143

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,130
Jingjing, are you sleeping?

180
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,410
No. What's the matter?

181
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,810
I can't sleep. Can we talk?

182
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,170
Sure.

183
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,970
Well, the light was turned off so early.

184
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,250
Who is able to sleep now?

185
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,090
That's right.

186
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,810
He Ran, are you going to sleep now?

187
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,850
No.

188
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,730
She's not sleeping. Great.

189
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,820
We're talking quietly.

190
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,890
Are we disturbing you?

191
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,570
No. Carry on.

192
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,810
Let me tell you.

193
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,930
I think

194
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,330
I'm in love.

195
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,650
What's going on?

196
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,170
Is he from our campus?

197
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,370
No, I have yet to know him,

198
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,770
but

199
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,730
I'm sure that

200
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,730
I've fallen for him at first sight.

201
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,650
What? That's exciting!

202
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,770
Tell us quickly!

203
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,170
When did it happen?

204
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,890
In the afternoon today,

205
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,770
I went to the hospital
to visit my cousin.

206
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,890
You met him in the hospital?

207
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,050
No.

208
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,450
Before I went to the hospital,

209
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,480
I was buying a bouquet of lilies

210
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,810
in the nearby flower shop.

211
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,400
So, you met him in the flower shop?

212
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,880
Yes.

213
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,210
No.

214
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,940
Where did you meet him?

215
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,570
Tell me now.

216
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,010
Don't interrupt.

217
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,050
Let me finish.

218
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,330
Hurry up.

219
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,450
After I bought the flowers,

220
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,970
I paid using my mobile phone.

221
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,970
I left it in the shop,

222
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,490
but I wasn't aware of that.

223
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,450
I only realised when I was

224
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,330
coming out from the hospital.

225
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,010
I was so anxious.

226
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,250
It was already in the evening.

227
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,930
I was thinking

228
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,020
if I had left it in the flower shop.

229
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,170
I ran there.

230
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,610
Then I realised that

231
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,890
the lady who sold the flowers to me
in the daytime

232
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,130
was gone.

233
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,330
It has become a guy.

234
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,370
- It's him?
- It's him?

235
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,130
Yes, it's him.

236
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,170
He's really handsome.

237
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,930
Is he the manager there?

238
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,490
I think so.

239
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,930
He was still there at that hour.

240
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,960
As I was walking into the shop,

241
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,290
he was walking down
from the second floor.

242
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,840
He's wearing casually.

243
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,610
I think he stays in the shop.

244
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,210
What's his name?

245
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,610
I don't know.

246
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,130
Didn't you ask him?

247
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,570
I didn't get to ask him.

248
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,130
But,

249
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,610
his voice sounds nice.

250
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,970
When I went in, I asked him

251
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,690
if anyone had left a mobile phone here.

252
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,770
He asked me to wait coolly.

253
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,450
Then he turned around,
took the phone out

254
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,410
from the drawer and passed it to me.

255
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,010
Then?

256
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,570
His voice is nice.

257
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,530
He's just said one word to me though.

258
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,090
He passed you the phone.

259
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,610
Didn't you thank him and

260
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,930
ask for his WeChat?

261
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,570
No.

262
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:31,970
I was...

263
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,850
I was too nervous.

264
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,410
I mean it.

265
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,810
My heart was beating so quickly.

266
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,970
I dared not even look him in the eyes.

267
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,650
I was so nervous that I can't talk.

268
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,010
He passed me the phone.

269
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,570
I turned around and ran away.

270
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,930
You're such a cowardly custard.

271
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,490
What are you planning to do?

272
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,570
Don't you want to know him?

273
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,250
Where is the flower shop?
Is it far from our campus?

274
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,170
Not far. It's just nearby our campus.

275
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,570
I've checked after I came back.

276
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,170
You've checked the route online.

277
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,130
Ding Xiaoran

278
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,650
is about to make her move.

279
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,090
Also,

280
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,290
I think god is helping me.

281
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,890
What do you mean?

282
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,450
My cousin's coffee shop is just

283
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,370
next door to the flower shop.

284
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,890
They're hiring part-time
university students.

285
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,370
So, you're working part-time there

286
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,330
near the flower shop.

287
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,610
You'll create the chance to meet him.

288
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,170
Before the light was turned off,

289
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,850
I've called my cousin.

290
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,090
She asked me to go directly
to her shop tomorrow.

291
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,330
Look at your speed.

292
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,170
You're very determined.

293
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,770
She doesn't even know his name.

294
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,730
I only have morning class tomorrow.

295
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,130
I'll go there as soon as
the class is over.

296
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,210
Okay, let's sleep early.

297
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,970
Otherwise, Ding Xiaoran will need

298
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,450
to meet her Prince Charming
with dark eye circles tomorrow.

299
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,770
Let's sleep early.

300
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,170
Let's sleep.

301
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,770
He Ran is sleeping.

302
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,050
She's not moving.

303
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,570
She should be sleeping.

304
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,500
(Theatre)

305
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,570
We'll be watching a movie?

306
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,290
I thought

307
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,090
you have some great creativity.

308
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,970
My campus card is about to expire.

309
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,290
We'll get the half-price movie ticket.

310
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,570
Okay.

311
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,930
Hello, the next movie, please.

312
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,090
Two student tickets.

313
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,690
Is she also a student?

314
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,970
Of course. She's my senior.

315
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,930
She's also my girlfriend.

316
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:53,970

My house.

341
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,490
Are you crazy?

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,010
There are a lot of people in this house

346
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,610
and they're all at home at this hour.

347
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,930
Are you crazy? I'm leaving.

348
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,490
Don't go.

349
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,570
What if they find out?

350
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,130
Then just meet my parents.

351
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,090
What?

352
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,250
Who...

353
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,890
Who is that?

354
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,210
Quickly hide behind me.

355
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,010
What should we do?

356
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,770
Let's go. That's my grandmother.

357
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,320
It's okay.
She's taking an afternoon nap.

358
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,010
Be quiet.

359
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,250
Where is your room?

360
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,810
You want to go to my room?

361
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,210
Of course. Where else should we go
if it's not your room?

362
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,250
My room is intimate.

363
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,050
Are you sure you want to go?

364
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,970
I actually just wanted

365
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,170
to bring you to the living room.

366
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,930
If you insist,

367
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,650
I can't say no to that.

368
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,690
You're annoying.

369
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,130
Be careful with the staircase.

370
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,690
Yuanqi, you're not working today?

371
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,210
No.

372
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,890
I'm off this weekend.

373
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,330
Yes.

374
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,970
Look at how confused I am.

375
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,850
Didn't uncle go to the factory?

376
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,490
No.

377
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,170
He's playing mahjong upstairs
with your uncles.

378
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,810
I'm sending some fruits to them.

379
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,330
Do you want to go up and take a look?

380
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,530
Your sister is upstairs as well.

381
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,650
She's lucky today.

382
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,650
She's the only one winning.

383
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,970
I'm not joining them.

384
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,170
I don't know how to play that.

385
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,450
All right.

386
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,450
Go ahead.

387
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,210
- Okay.
- I'm going up.

388
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,010
Okay, aunt.

389
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,410
You have a big family.

390
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,210
Is this your room?

391
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,170
Aren't you afraid of falling down?

392
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,970
No.

393
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,610
How can an adult fall down?

394
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,810
Isn't it comfortable?

395
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,930
My quilt.

396
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,570
Quilt.

397
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,170
It's comfortable.

398
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,850
It's made of down feather?

399
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,210
It's cotton.

400
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,210
Your room is so inconvenient.

401
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,370
There's not even a sofa.

402
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,010
Do you have anything to drink
in your room?

403
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,690
The fridge is in the dining room.

404
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,250
I'll get it for you.

405
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,170
Wait for me in the room.

406
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,650
You're going to the dining room.

407
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,130
What should I do alone?

408
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,810
You're an adult.

409
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,170
Are you afraid to stay
in the room alone?

410
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,370
I'm not afraid.

411
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,970
Then...

412
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,530
Then you should quickly come back.

413
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,410
Okay.

414
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,770
I'll be quick.

415
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,690
That's fast.

416
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,050
Who are you?

417
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,770
I...

418
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,770
Are you my uncle's girlfriend?

419
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,810
Your uncle's...?

420
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,970
You are. Grandmother!

421
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,970
Grandmother!

422
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,850
Don't shout. Keep it a secret.

423
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,250
Be nice.

424
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,450
Colosseum Lego!

425
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,330
Deal.

426
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,970
Okay.

427
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,570
I was frightened.

428
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,370
Come on. That's a child.

429
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,770
What?

430
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,170
What if he shouted

431
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,610
and all your family members

432
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,530
came here?

433
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,850
Where's the drink?

434
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,820
I forgot.

435
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,170
I saw him running here

436
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,170
so I was following him.

437
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:02,970
I'll go get it.

438
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,960
Will you keep your words?

439
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,930
Is this for me?

440
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,290
I want Monkey King Warrior Mech, too.

441
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:23,970
No problem.

442
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,850
Give it to me before next Wednesday.

443
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,490
Okay.

444
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,570
Have a good day. Bye.

445
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,370
Your house is very lively.

446
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,890
We have to go to another place.

447
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,290
This is considered
a rather intimate place.

448
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,690
My family will not come in here.

449
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,010
It's quiet.

450
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,210
Did you paint all these?

451
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,970
Yes, I was learning about painting
from a teacher for a few years.

452
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,450
It's just my hobby. It's amateur.

453
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,690
The painting is indeed ordinary.

454
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,290
Do you know about painting?

455
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,450
No,

456
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,170
but I've seen something better.

457
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,330
My husband was a famous painter.

458
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,630
No, my late husband.

459
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,610
Do you mind telling me his name?

460
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,930
I do.

461
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,370
His paintings were fantastic.

462
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,010
You might feel embarrassed
if I told you his name.

463
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,370
He is that famous?

464
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,170
Yes,

465
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,850
but sadly he's gone.

466
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,010
Based on the market value now,

467
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,170
his painting could be worth
an astronomical price.

468
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,010
I don't have to be suffering.

469
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,250
You're doing well now.

470
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,850
We should live for ourselves.

471
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,290
Yes.

472
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,490
We should live for ourselves.

473
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,690
That time,

474
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,530
he didn't even go out.

475
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,210
He'd stay in his studio every day.

476
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,130
I wasn't working back then.

477
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,130
I didn't have to do anything.
I just needed to keep him accompany.

478
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,570
It's like life is like that.

479
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,690
We're trapped in the frame.

480
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,410
The world that we can see is so small.

481
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,290
We can only reach a few persons.

482
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,330
My life

483
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,050
was about to reach the end.

484
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,770
It's boring.

485
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,930
It's really boring.

486
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,610
After he passed away,

487
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,370
I started my own business.

488
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,130
It's tough,

489
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,490
but I felt good about it.

490
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,090
After that,

491
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,410
I met you,

492
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,970
little boy.

493
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,170
I'm happy.

494
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,290
I'm really happy.

495
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,050
I feel...

496
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,330
I feel young again.

497
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,410
That's my favourite painting.

498
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,210
I found it in the night market.

499
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,770
I asked for this space

500
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,490
from my father.

501
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,010
No matter I'm happy or sad,

502
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,810
or when I'm bored,

503
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,930
I'll come here.

504
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,890
I also had a dog and a cat.

505
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,850
They've left for

506
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,770
certain reasons.

507
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,250
If we got to know each other earlier,

508
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,210
maybe you could've met them.

509
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,690
If there's a chance,

510
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,330
teach me how to play piano.

511
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,330
Do you remember how?

512
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,690
I think you might need this.

513
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,450
When I met you for the first time,

514
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,410
you were eating fried chicken
and hamburger.

515
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,410
You were even cursing.

516

I didn't expect that you'd dress up

517
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,370
for a date with me.

518
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,010
What colour do you like?

519
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,570
Do you like cat or dog?

520
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,450
Are you hungry?

521

I know a nice restaurant.

I can call them and book a table.

watch another movie?

It's still early.

531
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,650
- We still have the night.
- I need to go.

532
