3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,040
Hello, ma'am.

4
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,830
(Hello, Ran.)

5
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,910
(I have something important that)

6
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,230
(I need to go back to my hometown
for a few days.)

7
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,190
(I wanted to call Mrs. Qiu
to apply for leave,)

8
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,710
(but I can't reach Mrs. Qiu's phone.)

9
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,790
(So, I have to call you.)

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,350
Are you leaving today?

11
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,550
(I...)

12
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,750
(The man next door and I...)

13
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,150
(We're going back to get married)

14
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,990
(and settle down.)

15
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,260
Really? You're getting married?

16
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,270
(Yes.)

17
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,470
(Speaking of that, I need to thank you.)

18
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,310
Why do you need to thank me?

19
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,270
Go back first.

20
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,040
Your marriage is more important.

21
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll tell my mother later.

22
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,910
(Thank you.)

23
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,220
(Well, when I'm not around,)

24
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,360
(you must take care of yourself.)

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,910
(Remember to eat and
take medicine on time.)

26
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,310
Okay.

27
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,920
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself.

28
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm hanging up.

29
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,620
(Bye.)

(Transferring)

32
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,640
Mrs. Qiu,

33
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,230
there's an online conference meeting

34
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,350
at 4 p.m.

35
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,510
The client wants to

36
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,870
meet you at 6 p.m.

37
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,230
They want to verify with you

38
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,980
on the details.

39
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay, I got it.

40
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,390
I'll confirm with the rest

41
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,950
on the conference meeting at 4 p.m.

42
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,190
I'll inform them.

43
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,580
Go ahead.

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,310
Okay.

45
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,100
(Zhang Yuanqi. Conference meeting
at 3 p.m. Don't be late.)

46
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,580
(Mrs. Qiu. Conference meeting
at 3 p.m. Don't be late.)

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,310
(Online conference meeting
at 3 p.m. Don't be late.)

48
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,280
(Online Meeting at 3 p.m.
Don't be late.)

49
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,380
(Meeting time: 2018 February 24, 16:00)

50
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,660
(Okay.)

51
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,430
What are you doing?

52
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,390
It's rare to see you deserting your post
during working hour.

53
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,350
What time is

54
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,020
our meeting later?

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,990
You mean the online conference meeting?

56
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,180
It's at 4 p.m.

57
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,430
because a few colleagues
from other departments

58
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,060
are not back in the office yet.

59
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,830
There's why we're holding
an online meeting.

60
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,150
You're leaving now?

61
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,560
Mrs. Qiu is still in the office.

62
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,430
You might be caught.

63
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,270
No problem. I'm not scared.

64
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,260
(Starting the conference meeting)

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,430
(Zhang Yuanqi, Qiu Jiarong)

66
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,950
(Zhang Yuanqi, Qiu Jiarong)
(What's the problem?)

67
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,030
(Zhang Yuanqi, Qiu Jiarong)
(Where are the rest?)

68
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,140
(Zhang Yuanqi, Qiu Jiarong)

69
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,990
(Who is laughing?)

70
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,150
It's me.

71
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,790
Hello, Mrs. Qiu.

72
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm Zhang Yuanqi.

73
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,630
(Zhang Yuanqi, come out here.)

74
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,390
(Do you think you're watching
a live show?)

75
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,990
Okay.

76
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,150
Hold on a second.

77
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,840
(Why...)

78
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,510
(Why is there only you here?)

79
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,200
(Where are the rest?)

80
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,340
(Maybe they were informed
the wrong time.)

81
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,230
(They are not online yet.)

82
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,390
Then...

83
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,830
Let's wait for a while.

84
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,790
Okay.

85
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,880
Is your wrist getting better?

86
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,190
(It's recovered.)

87
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,710
(Thank you for your concern, Mrs. Qiu.)

88
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,830
No one is concerning you.

89
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,980
The promotion for
next season is beginning.

90
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,710
I was worried that
you might delay your work.

91
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,910
Don't worry.

92
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,070
We won't delay our work.

93
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,230
What?

94
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,630
"We"?

95
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,270
(What "we"?)

96
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,750
(Wrist.)

97
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,230
(What did you hear?)

98
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,070
(Nothing.)

99
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,030
(I was talking about wrist, too.)

100
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,830
(So, you must take care of yourself.)

101
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,070
(You must not delay your work.)

102
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,710
Okay.

103
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,950
Last night...

104
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,390
Last night...

105
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,910
Did you watch that movie?

106
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,710
(Yes.)

107
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,710
(It's good.)

108
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,230
(Do I need to be responsible?)

109
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,190
You still have ten minutes

110
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,390
to think about the question

111
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,590
because ten minutes later,

112
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,980
the real meeting will start.

113
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,230
(Time's up.)

114
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,990
(It seems like you will)

115
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,510
(not give me an answer today.)

116
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,660
(I'm leaving first. See you later.)

117
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,550
(Mrs. Qiu.)

118
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,630
Don't you think Mrs. Qiu

119
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,340
is little weird today?

120
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,670
I think so.

121
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,550
I think she

122
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,510
is absent-minded, isn't she?

123
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,470
It's totally different from the way

124
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,920
she's usually being mean.

125
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,110
Also, I think

126
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,680
she's troubled

127
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,870
and she's not very happy.

128
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,430
I wonder who has upset her.

129
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,550
It could be me.

130
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,990
Zhang Yuanqi,

131
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,990
you knew about the meeting time,
didn't you?

132
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,780
Why didn't you tell me?

133
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,440
You wanted to make fun of me?

134
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,870
No.

135
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,710
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

136
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,990
I've just finished the meeting.

137
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,790
You can't talk?
A lot of people are around you?

138
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,550
Okay.

139
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,590
I've just finished the meeting.

140
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,240
Why can't you talk?

141
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,680
Do we need to avoid each other?

142
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,440
Zhang Yuanqi, let me tell you.

143
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,420
Stop imagining things.

144
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,670
I looked for you because of...

145
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,990
Because of what?

146
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,980
♪Right through the door♪

147
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,790
We don't have to avoid each other?

148
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,540
Then why are you hiding here?

149
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,540
♪I've never been through♪

152
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,580
Why should I be angry?

153
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,310
Why would I be angry?

154

What for?

157
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,910

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,140

Of course we can't pay all the debts.

165
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,500
The insurance claim is already
a huge amount of money,

166
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,000
but it's still not enough.

167
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,190
Xiao Han has been living a poor life.

168
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,660
I think he can't help much.

169
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,310
He's a good man.

You know nothing about plants.

171
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,510
They can't live without the cultivator.

172
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,540
You thought I'm my sister?

173
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,510
How would I know?

174
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,360
Enough. Stop talking, okay?

175
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,830
Book tomorrow's flight ticket for me.

176
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,700
We'll figure this out when I get back.

177
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,710
Bye.

178
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,230
Xiao Han.

179
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,230
Xiao Han.

180
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,150
Get someone to check on this painting.

181
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,230
Xiao Han.

182
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't get me wrong.

183
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,030
I'm not here for anything.

184
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,070
I've figured it out and I'm ready to go.

185
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,550
I'm just here to say goodbye.

186
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,630
When are you leaving?

187
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,680
The flight is departing tomorrow night.

188
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,840
Thank you for taking care of me
during this period of time.

189
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,110
Also, for the recent years.

190
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,470
Also, Zaozao.

191
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,990
Please take care of it.

192

(The painting is genuine.
Where did you see it?)

193

(The painting is genuine.)

194
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,670

198
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,750
No.

199
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,030
I'm leaving now.

200
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,870
There's something
I need to return to you.

201
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,540
This is given to me by He Ran.

202
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,550
There's one million inside.

203
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,080
She wants me to leave Qiongzhou
and you immediately.

204
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,230
I think I shouldn't take this money.

205
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,590
Help me return it to her.

206
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,910
Where are you?

207
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,710
I'm at home.

208
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,870
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

209
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,710
I was sleeping.

210
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,590
Are you coming over at night?

211
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,430
Xiao Han.

212
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,910
There's no one

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,310

Your body temperature

313
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,670

you're having a fever.

the blood test, okay?

322

Why don't you

327
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,990
prescribe the medicine for us?

328
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,510
Okay.

329
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,590
I'll give you antipyretics.

330
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,040
Why didn't you listen to the doctor?

331
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,030
Do a blood test and drip

332
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,640
will help you recover faster, right?

333
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,390
Your body temperature is
41 degree Celsius.

334
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,460
Luckily I found out early.

335
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,100
Otherwise, your brain
would've been burnt.

336

Isn't that good?

337
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,380
I'll know no one after that.

338
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,190
I'll just follow behind you.

339
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,300
Xiao Han, I want to sleep for a while.

340
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,270
Could you hold me tight?

341
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,430
Ranran.

342
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,990
Don't frighten me.

343
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,590
Please hold on.

344
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,110
I think that's mine.

345
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,950
You don't want to give it to me?

346
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,830
This is your card.

347
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,110
Thank you.

348
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,150
Mrs. Qiu.

349
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,550
This is our floor. We're leaving now.

350
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,740
Rest early.

351
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,790
Mrs. Qiu, see you tomorrow.

352
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,630
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye bye.

353
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,990
Mrs. Qiu, this is my floor.

354
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,320
See you tomorrow.

355
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,150
See you tomorrow.

356
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,870
Sleep now.

357
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,470
Be good.

to stay in my house and not leaving?

I'm telling you. This is not good.

You can't do this.

380

No.

400
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,910
I was buying something to drink
in the convenience store.

401
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,110
Is there anything?

402

I'm leaving.

405
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,350
Do you want to have a drink with me?

406
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,670
No, thanks.

407
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,540
Why can't I open the door?

408
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,750
You're using your personal ID.

409
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,990
Good night.

410
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,190
I have something to tell you.

411
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,550
I'll say something first.

412
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,150
Why do you like me?

413
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,870
I'm not young anymore.

414
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,550
Few years ago,

415
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,990
my husband was diagnosed with leukemia.

416
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,030
A year later,

417
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,790
he jumped off the building
and committed suicide.

418
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,990
After that,

419
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,580
my daughter was diagnosed
with leukemia, too.

420
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,430
I was going through the chemotherapy

421
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,520
with her in the hospital for two years.

422
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,510
She hardly

423
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,550
survived it,

424
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,270
but the doctor told me that

425
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,070
her sickness will

426
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,910
very likely relapse.

427
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,190
After that,

428
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,470
my life has been a mess.

429
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,590
Every night,

430
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,390
whenever I close my eyes,

431
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,870
I'll have a nightmare.

432
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,430
I started to lose sleep and drink.

433
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,390
I'm taking long-term anti-depressant.

434
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,550
I...

435
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,150
I don't even have the courage
to start again.

436
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,630
I'm really scared.

437
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,990
I'm scared that they'll all leave me

438
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,430
and I'll be alone eventually.

439
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,590
I...

440
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,550
I've tried

441
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,950
to go out with a few guys,

442
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,470
but nothing worked out.

443
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,150
No one likes

444
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,790
an emotional woman

445
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,510
with short temper

446
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,830
and anxiety.

447
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,310
I can't let my daughter

448
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,430
know about my relationship.

449
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,190
I can't let her feel uncomfortable.

450
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,430
But I know...

451
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,630
I know everything makes her

452
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,190
feel uncomfortable.

453
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,910
I'm

454
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,070
a failed mother.

455
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,190
I'm also a failed woman.

456
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,190
This is my life.

457
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,550
I don't deserve happiness.

458
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,310
I don't even deserve love.

459
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,910
Zhang Yuanqi.

460
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,550
Did you hear me?

461
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,070
Did you hear me clearly?

462
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,230
If you're not ready

463
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,790
and you didn't hear me clearly,

464
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,270
we should end it here.

465
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,710
Open the door.

466
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,910
Open the door.

467
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,870

468
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,830
I left in a hurry just now.

469
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,470
I was not in time to tell you this.

470

Go ahead.
