=Episode 7=

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,920
Ma'am.

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,090
Ma'am.

5
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,010
Why is there no water?

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,170
Ma'am.

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,650
We are out of water.

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,450
Okay, I'll call someone to bring water.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,450
By the way, I...

10
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,200
Xiao Han. Why are you here?

11
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,650
Mr. Xiao is

12
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,530
our new horticulturist.

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,170
She is...

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,970
I am

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,610
this family's new home tutor,

16
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,530
who teaches the children to draw.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,090
Yes.

18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,120
Exactly.

19
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,810
Ms. He is a painting teacher.

20
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Do you know each other?

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,400
What a coincidence.

22
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,970
Yes, what a coincidence.

23
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,880
I've only been

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
working here part time for two days.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,530
All right.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,970
Do your work.

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,810
I'll go inside to teach.

28
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,560
By the way,

29
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,530
my student said she would
like to eat dragon fruit.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,650
Please cut some for her.

31
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Xiao, I'll leave you to it.

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,720
Thank you.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,490
And water, too.

34
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,490
Is he

35
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,810
your friend from the outside?

36
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,250
The kind of friend

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,600
I don't want my mother to know about.

38
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,650
Then I'll find a reason to let him go.

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,210
Okay.

40
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,840
Mother.

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,240
You are back.

42
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,240
Mrs. Qiu.

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Zhang.

44
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,280
How many times have I told you?

45
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,090
Don't let strangers into the house.

46
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,800
Who is that person in the garden?

47
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,890
That's the new horticulturist.

48
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,800
If you don't like him,
I will ask him to leave.

49
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,240
Ran just mentioned it randomly.

50
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,890
She's just curious.
Don't take it seriously.

51
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,530
So sorry. Thank you.

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
Okay.

53
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,400
Not at all. We really appreciate it.

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,690
Okay, I got it.

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,330
Okay, thank you.

56
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,650
It was a misunderstanding.

57
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,770
Mr. Han said

58
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,800
he heard from Han Yu that you've been

59
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,890
into gardening lately.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
The last time you visited him
at home, he was not around.

61
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,280
Since our garden

62
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,770
hadn't been tended to for a long time,

63
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,210
he hired

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,090
a good friend of his,

65
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
a very good horticulturist

66
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,890
called

67
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,890
Xiao Han.

68
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,090
You don't have to be shy.

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,010
If you need anything, just tell him.

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
He will definitely make our garden

71
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,920
look great.

72
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,330
Zhang.

73
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
Since he is Mr. Han's friend,

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
we can't afford to be rude.

75
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,130
Go and make a nice pot of tea.

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,210
Invite him in.

77
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,130
Mother.

78
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,650
Let's just

79
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,720
forget it.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,240
Don't interfere with his work.

81
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,090
We are not interfering.

82
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,010
This is basic hospitality.

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
Look at what you're wearing.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,800
Go up and change into
something more proper

85
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,480
and meet Mr. Xiao later.

86
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,040
I...

87
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,920
Go ahead.

88
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,720
Go.

89
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,970
I will invite Mr. Xiao in.

90
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,210
Zhang.

91
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,920
Go and make tea.

92
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,090
It would be more appropriate

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,010
for me to invite him in person.

94
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,920
Hurry up.

95
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,040
Put all these photos away.

96
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,360
Which one?

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,090
This one.

98
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,890
Give them to me.

99
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,720
And this.

100
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,690
What else?

101
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,890
And this painting.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,090
This one?

103
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:51,970
Move it there.

104
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,360
Okay.

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,130
Here.

106
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,280
I'll hold this side.

107
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,400
Here.

108
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,480
Okay.

109
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,160
Ranran.

110
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,160
Mother.

111
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,130
What are you two doing?

112
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,840
I think

113
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,330
this is not a very good painting.

114
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
I want to turn it over.

115
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,800
Not good?

116
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,160
Then why did you hang it on the ceiling?

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,800
What are you doing

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,970
sneaking around?

119
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,650
Didn't I ask you to get changed?

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,770
Why haven't you get changed?

121
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,130
- I'll go now.
- Listen.

122
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,840
Later, have tea with Mr. Han's friend

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,530
and behave normally.

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,450
Hurry up.

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,450
Okay.

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,090
Your mother said that

127
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,360
your friend was particularly aloof

128
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,130
and declined her invitation.

129
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,360
Why are you still in bed?

130
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,480
Get up now.

131
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,810
Take a shower and change your clothes.

132
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,360
Mr. Han and his family

133
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,210
are coming to our house
for afternoon tea.

134
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,450
What?

135
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,120
Mother, why did you invite them over?

136
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,450
Simply a word from you

137
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,210
and Mr. Han hired

138
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,880
a horticulturist for you.

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
You need to return this favour.

140
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,640
And they also happened to have time.

141
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,520
Also, I invited Mr. Xiao

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,290
for tea last time,
but he didn't come.

143
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,760
So this time,

144
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,970
they will bring him along.

145
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Are they here?

146
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,000
Wait. Put on a jacket.

147
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,330
Don't catch a cold.

148
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,050
Slowly.

149
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,360
Mr. Han, Mrs. Han.

150
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,290
Ranran.

151
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:47,970
Jiarong.

152
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,450
Long time no see, Ranran.

153
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,170
You look so thinner.

154
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,760
She doesn't eat properly
and is a picky eater.

155
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,120
Young people are all the same.

156
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,930
Yu is also a picky eater.

157
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes, I only eat meat.

158
00:09:59,410 --> 00:09:59,810
Let's go inside.

159
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,480
Okay.

160
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,210
Come on.

161
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,880
My brother

162
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,970
likes to be around

163
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,600
flowers and plants.

164
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,970
At home, he is also immersed
in the garden every day.

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,450
He treats these flowers and plants

166
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,090
more precious than his nephew.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Exactly.

168
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,970
Last time, Yu broke one of his plants

169
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,170
and he was so angry

170
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,330
that he said he would send Yu abroad

171
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,360
would not let him return.

172
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,210
It was

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
this man who later

174
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,240
saved the day.

175
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,640
He's very content.

176
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
This guy looks...

177
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,450
Han Yu.

178
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,970
I bought a new puzzle.

179
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,570
Do you want to do it with me?

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
Puzzle?

181
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,520
That thing is stupid and boring.

182
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,930
Well, it's quite an achievement

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,240
for us to put it together.

184
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,880
Together?

185
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,640
Okay.

186
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
I like such a stupid game.

187
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,450
Let's go upstairs.

188
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:58,970
Okay.

189
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,810
(Don't let my mother mention my name.)

190
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,520
(Don't let my mother mention my name.)
Don't let my mother mention my name.

191
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,860
(Don't let my mother mention my name.)

192
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,380
(Ran: Don't let my mother
mention my name.)

193
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,840
(Okay, I'll try.)

194
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,520
(Okay, I'll try.)
Okay, I'll try.

195
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,900
(Okay, I'll try.)

196
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,090
These flower species

197
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,090
have high pH requirements.

198
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,640
I see you didn't use a test strip.

199
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,360
You just used your
hands to determine it.

200
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
How did you figure out

201
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,640
its pH value?

202
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,050
This can be determined by
the cohesiveness of the soil

203
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,840
and its moisture content.

204
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,410
No instrumentation,

205
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,120
just by feeling?

206
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,810
You can tell

207
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,600
the basic difference by feeling it.

208
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,880
You can do that with saline soils,

209
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,410
but you're the first
person I've ever met

210
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,970
who can determine the exact proportions

211
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,240
as precisely as you can.

212
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,330
Last time you told me

213
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,970
you had worked on

214
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,210
a new plant.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Where do you grow it?

216
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,210
I have a rooftop above my house.

217
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,120
I built a simple glass greenhouse.

218
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,600
I'd like to visit your place sometime.

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,520
Are you okay with that?

220
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,570
There are not many
domestic people doing this.

221
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,290
Foreign countries are more
advanced in this area.

222
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,170
Last time I visited Japan,

223
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,290
I visited their...

224
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,600
What do you think
they are talking about?

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,240
We won't understand.

226
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,240
Exactly.

227
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,450
My brother

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,170
only cares about flowers and plants.

229
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,810
Why don't you two

230
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,210
set up a tent here?

231
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,970
You can stay here for the night.

232
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,360
Have some coffee.

233
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:38,840
You can do it later.

234
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,120
Okay.

235
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,760
What is the magic

236
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,360
of these flowers and plants?

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,840
My daughter...

238
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,570
Mrs. Qiu.

239
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,050
Would you like a refill of this coffee?

240
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,690
Sure.

241
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,970
Thank you.

242
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,000
Pour some for everyone.

243
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,930
Okay.

244
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,570
Pour some for Mr. Xiao, too.

245
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,090
Where was I?

246
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,690
Her father.

247
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,970
When her father was alive,

248
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,000
he liked to paint
flowers and plants, too.

249
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,930
My daughter took after him.

250
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,240
She painted Queen of the Night

251
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,720
and hung it on
the ceiling of her bedroom,

252
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,120
which surprised me.

253
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,840
Ranran is...

254
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,050
This is freshly baked bread.

255
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,090
Try it.

256
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,240
Here you go.

257
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,170
Okay.

258
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
Thank you.

259
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,060
(Tell them I fainted.)

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Mrs. Qiu.

261
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,090
This is bad.

262
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,520
Your daughter fainted.

263
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,690
What?

264
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,480
Let's go and see.

265
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,090
What happened?

266
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,210
Why did you suddenly faint?

267
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,210
I don't know either.

268
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,970
I was stunned.

269
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,520
Luckily I got her into bed in time.

270
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,880
What's going on?

271
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,450
Wasn't the last checkup positive?

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,690
Don't worry.

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,480
We have a doctor here.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,760
Let me see.

275
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,520
Do you have candy?

276
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,240
Candy?

277
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,360
- Candy?
- Yes.

278
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,760
Here. Eat this.

279
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,930
Don't worry. She's just
low on blood sugar.

280
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,970
Ranran.

281
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,050
Did you have proper breakfast recently?

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,840
I got up hastily just now.

283
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,000
I feel much better now.

284
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,000
Gosh.

285
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,840
I can't let anything happen to you.

286
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,520
It's all right.

287
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,480
Jiarong, I guess

288
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,000
we should go back.

289
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,760
Let Ranran take a good rest.

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,690
Don't worry too much.

291
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,330
She has been in good health recently.

292
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,290
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

293
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:09,720
It's all right.

295
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,050
Ranran, take a good rest.

296
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,720
We'll get going.

297
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,000
Take good care of her.

298
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,970
Don't pressure her too much either.

299
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,290
Don't worry.

300
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,410
- Okay.
- I'll get going.

301
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,170
Goodbye.

302
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,050
Goodbye.

303
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,760
Do you feel better now?

304
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,520
I'll pour you a glass of water.

305
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,330
Lie down.

306
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,970
Here, eat more black fungus

307
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,480
and vegetables.

308
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,970
Eat slowly.

309
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,930
Try the chicken.

310
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay, I got it.

311
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,170
Ranran.

312
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,760
The company

313
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,320
has a problem with the supplier.

314
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,320
I have to make a trip to the factory.

315
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,040
You take care of yourself.

316
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,480
I'll come back to
accompany you when I'm done.

317
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,800
Go ahead, mother.

318
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,280
Be safe on the road.

319
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,370
Eat more.

320
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,130
Mrs. Qiu.

321
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,280
How many times have I reminded you?

322
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Make sure He Ran eats
her meals regularly

323
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,410
and that the medication is taken
as prescribed by the doctor.

324
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,210
Understand?

325
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,320
Yes. Mrs. Qiu,

326
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,610
I'll be extra careful next time.

327
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,320
How come I didn't know

328
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,690
about her visit to Mr. Han?

329
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,930
I thought you wouldn't mind her

330
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,650
going to Mr. Han's.

331
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,970
It's fine that she's going
to Han Yu's house,

332
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,970
but you must let me know.

333
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,320
Put away all the mess in the house

334
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,520
and keep them in the warehouse.

335
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,410
Get rid of all the clothes
Ranran bought outside

336
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,320
secretly.

337
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,040
Yes, Mrs. Qiu.

338
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,850
I'll take care of it right away.

339
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,130
(I haven't seen you for the past
few days. Are you still mad at me?)

340
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,800
(Xiao Han)
I haven't seen you

341
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,930
(Xiao Han)
for the past few days.

342
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,720
(Xiao Han)

343
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,450
Are you still mad at me?

344
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,580
(I haven't seen you for the past
few days. Are you still mad at me?)

345
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,740
(I haven't seen you for the past
few days. Are you still mad at me?)

346
