=Episode 15=

3
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,170
Slow down.

4
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,840
Brother.

5
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,100
Play with me.

6
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,340
Play with me.

7
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,810
I'm busy. You go out and play.

8
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,170
Come on.

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll buy you a lollipop.
Go out and play.

10
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,570
I'm not a bad person.

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
I will buy you candy.

12
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,450
Go out and play.

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,290
Come on.

14
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,220
(Letter of resignation)

15
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,060
Letter of resignation.

16
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,930
Resignation letter!

17
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,200
Keep it down. Come here.

18
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,730
Grandpa.

19
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,400
My brother is quitting again.

20
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,010
He is writing a resignation letter.

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,680
I saw it!

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Let's go.

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,080
Quitting again?

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
You don't understand. There's a bit
of a misunderstanding this time.

25
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,170
What misunderstanding?

26
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,040
Your lady boss had a crush on you,

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,040
you refused

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
and she got mad and took revenge on you?

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,170
That's not it.

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,360
You are half right.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Does she really fancy you?

32
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,690
No, I mean the other half.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,450
She likes you.

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,640
Mum, what did I say?

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,690
I'm sure it won't last a month.

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,570
Who bet with me before?

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,920
Admit your defeat.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,130
Pay me now.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,970
Mum.

40
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,520
Why don't you set an example first?

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,010
Fine.

42
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,690
Grandma, you...

43
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,450
This is your fault.

44
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,640
You are a disappointment.

45
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,170
Here.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,970
Okay. Thanks, mum.

47
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,890
Here you go.

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,640
Thanks.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,410
Baby, pay up.

50
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,080
Here's my money for marshmallows.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,520
This is Yuanqi's fault.

52
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,410
Take it up with him.

53
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,600
You two young brats learnt bad examples.

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,360
You are not too young either,

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,290
yet you're not working hard.

56
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,760
That's right.

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,130
Pay up.

58
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,890
Why did you resign this time?

59
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,800
Last time your uncle
introduced you to a job.

60
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,040
Wasn't it a good one?

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,690
More money, less work and close to home.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
You quit after only two months.

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,600
Don't mention it.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,010
I'm pissed off.

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,040
I've sent many gifts. I've done favours

66
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,690
and drank a lot of alcohol

67
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,520
to get the job for him,

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,250
yet this brat just decided to quit.

69
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,410
My card buddy's daughter

70
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,850
works there.

71
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,970
She can go to work
every day if she wants to,

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,130
but if she doesn't, no one cares.

73
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,360
She can even take time off
whenever she wants.

74
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,080
It's not even a decent company.

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,760
Exactly.

76
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,520
You don't understand.

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,730
Why don't I get it?

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,450
I'm at least a business owner.

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,370
I have five storefronts and two hotels

80
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,570
in the shopping street
of Xiaozhou Village.

81
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,200
I make as much money as your boss.

82
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,400
I don't think the job

83
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,130
you found is any better.

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,130
See how quick you quit!

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,450
How come you can't

86
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,320
hold a job for long after graduation?

87
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,840
Mum, you're wrong to say that.

88
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,160
Yuanqi didn't find

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,760
a good job,

90
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
but he was a high achiever

91
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,050
from a major university.

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Exactly.

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,720
He is the only university student

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,160
in the Zhang family.

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Yes.

96
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,690
I think

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,400
you need to have a skill to find a job.

98
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,640
Yes, she's right.

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,010
Even if you don't have the skills,

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,810
you can still have
a good head on your shoulders.

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,930
Look at that boy

102
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,600
from the Wang family next door.

103
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,000
He learnt business from his father

104
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,570
before he finished junior high school

105
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,890
and now he's a big boss.

106
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,520
He just renovated his villa

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,050
and is getting married next month.

108
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,890
So,

109
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,160
Wang's grandson is getting married?

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,010
Yes.

111
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,250
Yuanqi, you have to get a grip.

112
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,890
Or I won't get a great-grandson

113
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,250
until I'm in my grave.

114
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,320
Look at your sister,

115
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,450
who graduated from secondary school.

116
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,890
She has no literacy,

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,280
yet manages to run
a homestay, earn rent income

118
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,050
and live a good life.

119
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,520
Now look at you.

120
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,810
What are you up to

121
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,640
all day long?

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,050
Mum.

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Yuanqi is busy with work.

124
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,260
Busy with work?

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
What has he achieved then?

126
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,080
I shouldn't have agreed with you

127
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,250
to let him study painting,

128
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,620
art

129
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
and all that nonsense
in the first place.

130
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,370
Exactly.

131
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,160
Why are you blaming me?

132
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,010
When Yuanqi

133
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,450
was so good at drawing,

134
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,890
I didn't see you stopping him.

135
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
I just felt sorry for my grandson.

136
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,400
Yuanqi.

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,250
Why don't you stop working

138
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,490
and stay home with me

139
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,890
to collect rent?

140
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,810
I have money.

141
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,370
I'll provide for you.

142
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,610
I want to give you

143
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,200
the row of shophouses on

144
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,450
Second Street, Xiaozhou Village.

145
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,720
Thank you, mum.

146
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,720
Stop it.

147
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,640
No, thanks.

148
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,280
I don't want your house.

149
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,140
You can leave it for someone in need.

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
I won't quit my job, I...

151
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,930
I...

152
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll try to do my best

153
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,510
to at least finish the job.

154
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,590
I'm full. Excuse me.

155
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
The shophouses in
Xiaozhou Village you mentioned...

156
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,830
Mum.

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,800
You should support

158
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,910
these two grandchildren, too.

159
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,030
Mum, I need you more, not him.

160
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,590
Mum.

161
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,350
Eat up.

163
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,960
He's the eldest grandson
who will take care of you.

164
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,790
You have to support him.

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,230
I'll leave him to you.

166
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,230
You're awake.

167
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,870
Why are you so drowsy lately?

168
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,470
I don't know why,

169
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,830
but I've been sleepy lately.

170
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,440
Really?

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,830
Are you feeling weak?

172
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,920
You should exercise more

173
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
if you don't have enough energy.

174
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,110
I'll help you.

175
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,160
Really?

176
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,280
What are you doing?

177
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,200
Nothing.

178
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,510
What are you thinking?

179
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
I just want to ask you a few questions.

180
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,830
Stop it.

181
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,320
What do you want to ask?

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,350
How many women have you had before?

183
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,800
Only a few.

184
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,440
I bet they're all pretty.

185
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,280
They just look like normal people.

186
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,280
And which one of them

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,510
is the most beautiful?

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,820
What exactly do you want to know?

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,240
What are their personalities like?

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,990
The personality of common people.

191
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,470
What about my personality?

192
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,500
♪When the night shines♪

193
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,300
♪I'm holding out♪

194
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,080
Mrs. Qiu.

195
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,320
Have you received any resignations

196
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,230
from the Human Resources Department?

197
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,840
Yes.

198
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,470
Good.

199
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,750
It's

200
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,440
Zhang Qi who has resigned.

201
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,440
Zhang Qi?

202
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,590
Zhang Qi resigned?

203
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,840
Yes, I thought you were
asking about her.

204
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,800
Why did she resign?

205
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,390
She said that she
had been given an offer

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
at the University of Singapore.

207
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,560
So she had to quit her job
to go to graduate school.

208
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,630
Mrs. Qiu, do you have any questions?

209
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Zhang Qi is indeed the most capable

210
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,470
of the new recruits.

211
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,230
Do you need me to inform HR...

212
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,350
No need.

213
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,680
It's good that she's
pursuing her studies.

214
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,510
Don't we have a meeting at 3.30pm?

215
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,470
I came to remind you that.

216
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,230
Let's go to the meeting.

217
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,080
Okay.

218
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,870
On-site execution of
this season's product fair

219
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,750
will be handled by Zhang Yuanqi
from the marketing department.

220
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,990
In the past, we used to get

221
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,590
a group of part-time
university students to do

222
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,110
all these chores for
our product promotions.

223
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,350
This time, the company

224
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,680
didn't allocate a part-time job,

225
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,120
which is obviously
making things difficult for you.

226
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,280
This mall

227
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,110
is the most crowded place in the area.

228
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,750
You're going to wear yourself out

229
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
if you work here all day.

230
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,040
It's just simple executive tasks.

231
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,320
Nothing difficult. I'll just do it

232
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,960
and get familiar with the workflow.

233
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,420
Are you alone?

234
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,900
I have over 200 boxes of goods.

235
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,820
Didn't your company send
more people over to help?

236
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,000
You can go to the counter
to register for membership,

237
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,020
where there is air conditioning.

238
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,750
Can you do it alone?

239
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,990
No problem.

240
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,360
Sir.

241
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,720
Can I borrow your gloves?

242
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,210
This is our newest

243
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,410
lactic acid sports drink,

244
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
which has been self-certified by

245
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,240
the US Food Safety Council.

246
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,410
It is made with
Lactobacillus plantarum TWK10.

247
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,720
We have conducted

248
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,570
both animal studies and
two double-blind controlled human trials

249
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,810
under strict specifications in line with

250
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,570
global food safety certification.

251
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,000
Tests have shown that

252
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,930
low doses of TWK10

253
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,760
can enhance liver glucose uptake

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,210
and improve glucose
utilisation in the body.

255
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,480
After we exercise,

256
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,240
our muscles feel sore and painful.

257
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,690
This drink helps to reduce

258
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,000
the discomfort of
lactic acid build-up after exercise,

259
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,050
thus enhancing performance.

260
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,530
If you like it,

261
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,720
you can queue up here
and scan the code to buy.

262
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
You are amazing.

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,930
We have exceeded our target today.

264
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,640
In the past,

265
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,690
this would have been
the workload of a dozen people.

266
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,410
Are you tired?

267
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,840
I see you've worked so hard today

268
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
and haven't even eaten yet.

269
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,210
I'll go back and eat after work.

270
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,810
Let me do it.

The marketing department did a good job

329
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,250
at the product promotion yesterday.

330
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,160
Keep it up.

331
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,010
Okay, meeting adjourned.

332
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,230
Remember to put away your rubbish

333
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,320
after eating in the meeting room.

334
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,670
You came early today.

335
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,990
Do you know that yesterday...

336
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,030
What?

337
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,230
Don't you recognise me anymore?

338
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,270
Zaozao.

339
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,270
I knew

340
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,710
I could count on you to take care of it.

341
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,270
You take good care of it.

342
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,190
Cats and people are different.

343
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,470
Aren't you going to
ask me how I've been doing?

344
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,360
How have you been these past few years?

345
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm not doing well.

346
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,510
A lot happened.

347
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,990
I miss having my sister...

348
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,800
Can we stop

349
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
talking about the past?

350
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,510
Sorry.

351
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
I didn't give it much thought.

352
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,710
I've travelled through
the day and night to get here.

353
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,430
I didn't expect it to be hot.

354
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,710
Can I have some water from this cup?

355
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,640
Not that cup.

356
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,670
I don't know this cup is...

357
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,470
I'll get you some water.

358
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,470
Have a seat.

359
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
Have you been living here
for the past few years?

360
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,400
It's quite artsy here.

361
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,120
It's very much your style.

362
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,120
Can I take a look around?

363
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,470
Is there

364
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,560
a greenhouse upstairs too?

365
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,950
Hello, Xiao Han is busy

366
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,270
and can't answer the phone.

367
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,950
Is there anything you
need me to convey to him?

368
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,640
Who are you?

369
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
I am Qin Zao.

370
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,360
Hello.

371
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,920
What do you have to say to Xiao Han?

372
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,190
Nothing.

373
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,840
I just want you to tell him

374
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,880
to wash my socks

375
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,510
and I'll pick them up tomorrow.

376
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,990
Okay.

377
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,320
I'll hang up then.

378
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,510
Wait.

379
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Who are you?

380
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,710
I am He Ran.

381
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
I mean who are you to Xiao Han?

382
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,190
Just look at my name on his phone

383
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,320
and you'll see.

384
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,100
(Favourite Child)

385
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,080
Okay.

386
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,990
I got it.

387
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,320
Now you know who I am.

388
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Would you like to meet me?

389
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
Sure.

390
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,950
Thank you.

391
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,230
Well,

392
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,880
there was a girl called He Ran

393
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,230
who rang you just now.

394
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,860
(Xiao Han)

395
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,820
Hello?

396
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,190
Did you just call me?

397
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,030
Qin Zao is her younger sister.

398
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I see.

399
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
Don't get the wrong idea.

400
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,750
When are you coming over tomorrow?

401
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,190
Tomorrow?

402
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,990
I'm not free tomorrow.

403
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,560
You said you were coming over tomorrow.

404
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,230
I was telling it to her.

405
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,190
Childish.

406
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,430
Don't overthink it.

407
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,430
I won't.

408
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,360
Aren't the two of us

409
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,640
having a blast right now?

410
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,800
Come over tomorrow.

411
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,320
Why?

412
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,470
I miss you.

413
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,320
I miss you, too.

414
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,400
Then I will go to you now.

415
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,430
Okay.

416
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,670
Xiao Han.

417
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,560
What are you doing here?

418
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,230
Quanquan's birthday is in a few days.

419
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,750
I'm preparing some small gifts for her.

420
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,430
I'll send them out later.

421
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,190
Quanquan's birthday?

422
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,160
Why didn't you tell me?

423
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,230
I want to give her a gift, too.

424
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,800
I'll go shopping with you

425
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,470
and send them out together.

426
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,670
Buying gifts is so meaningless.

427
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,360
I'll paint her a picture.

428
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,160
Do you still have
painting materials at home?

429
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,470
No.

430
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,160
Then let's buy some.

431
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,920
We'll go to the supermarket then.

432
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,400
No, common supermarkets don't have them.

433
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,750
How about this?
I've got a place in mind.

434
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,360
I'll take you there.

435
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,750
Come on.

436
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,080
I remember a rainy day when someone

437
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
crouched in front of my house

438
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,840
on the pretence that she couldn't find

439
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,160
her keys at the studio.

440
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,700
You don't understand.

441
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,670
This key is magical.

442
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,230
What magic?

443
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,640
When I come here alone,

444
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,400
I can't find it,

445
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,270
but when I come with the one I love,

446
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,320
I can find it.

447
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,880
I can't find it when I'm unhappy,

448
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,360
but I can find it when I'm happy.

449
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,320
Isn't this magical?

450
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
You are more magical.

451
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,190
The studio is busier
during the summer break

452
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,640
and after the holidays,
it becomes rather quiet.

453
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,800
So the principal uses it
as her collection room.

454
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,470
Inside, there are many
paintings from her collection

455
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
and her favourites.

456
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,470
There are a lot of painting tools there.

457
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,080
Be careful not to step on them.

458
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,670
What do you think of this painting?

459
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,710
It's nice.

460
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,920
However, I think

461
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,430
this fairy is too beautiful.

462
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,920
If the fairy is not beautiful,

463
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,710
how can she seduce Sanzang?

464
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,640
You drew Journey to the West.

465
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,760
Don't get sidetracked.

466
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,470
As the saying goes,

467
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,120
"If I die under a skirt,
I can still flirt as a ghost."

468
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,520
If I want to be in love,

469
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
I'm not afraid of anyone.

470
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,920
What are you looking at?

471
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,160
You're so absorbed in it.

472
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,160
Is this a picture of me?

473
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,600
Who drew this?

474
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,230
You only came to be a model once,

475
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,920
yet someone was so obsessed with you.

476
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,160
Let's go.

477
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,800
I'm not leaving.

478
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,160
This is only half done.

479
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,990
I have to help her.

480
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,880
Why don't you

481
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,990
sit still

482
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,750
and be my model.

483
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,990
Don't move.

484
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,920
You

485
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,950
don't

486
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,840
stand

487
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,880
a chance.

488
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,720
Why are you competing with a painting?

489
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,590
Wait.

490
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,680
Let me see.

491
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,110
This doesn't seem to be quite like you.

492
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,990
Looks pretty similar to me.

493
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,950
No.

494
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,070
There's something missing.

495
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,110
The person who drew this

496
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,180
has absolutely no idea
about your structure.

497
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,110
Look.

498
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,400
Skeletal structures, such as

499
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,510
the chin,

500
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,430
neck,

501
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,720
collarbone

502
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,240
and pectoral muscles.

503
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,880
What are you doing?

504
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,880
Nothing.

505
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,420
I am doing academic research.

506
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,030
And your waist.

507
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,720
You pull so many tricks

508
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,260
to take advantage of me.

509
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,100
♪So I'm giving in♪

510
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,840
You can even publish a book.

511
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,630
If I was to publish a book,

512
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,120
you'd have to write the preface for me.

513
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,990
What preface?

514
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,240
"I have

515
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,340
