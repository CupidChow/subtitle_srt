00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,230
Is Island cool?

4
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,180
Yes.

5
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,260
Let's wish them a successful show.

6
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,340
Make some noise!

7
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,980
Here. He Ran.

8
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,740
Sit here.

9
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,070
Who told you to sit here?

10
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,430
This is a sub-centre seat.

11
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,620
It's for her.

12
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,460
Get lost.

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,670
Enough. Don't make a fuss.

14
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,710
I just came by to tell you

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,460
I can't stay.

16
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,620
No, wait.

17
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,950
Just a moment.

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,430
I really have things
to do. I'll leave now.

19
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,430
Wait.

20
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,150
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,900
You've been back in
Qiongzhou for a month now,

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,310
yet you haven't even seen me once.

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
You promised to come to
my concert to support me.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,900
You didn't show up at the show

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,180
and now you're leaving

26
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,510
after just five minutes.

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,620
What's wrong with you?

28
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,380
At least I stay for five minutes.

29
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,460
Seriously, I have to meet someone.

30
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,260
I really have to go.

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,510
Who are you meeting?

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,060
A man or a woman?

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,030
A man. The cousin from last time.

34
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,780
Find a rightful owner

35
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,110
for your central position.

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,710
Stop fooling around.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,430
Bye.

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,430
Wait, He Ran.

39
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,030
I get it.

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,550
Ran is deliberately provoking you.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,550
I know women best.

42
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,340
The more she rejects you,

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,550
the more she likes you.

44
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,340
Really?

45
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,430
Yes.

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,150
Impossible.

47
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,220
You're still single yourself.

48
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm single because of my face.

49
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,150
But I'm telling you,

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,110
I am brilliant.

51
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,310
Do you mean

52
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,060
I'm not smart?

53
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,780
Let's drink.

54
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,780
That's not what I meant.

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,310
Cheers.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,060
How is your internship?

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,620
Boring.

58
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,740
Nothing to do.

59
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,620
I just want to find a place
to sleep every afternoon

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,390
and get by.

61
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,150
That doesn't sound like you.

62
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,590
The companies that my dad
found for me with his connections

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,500
all ignored me.

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,830
I did my resume and
applied to a few companies.

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,060
My New Year's wish is that

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,340
someone will hire me.

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,340
You are right.

68
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,500
It's almost Lunar New Year.

69
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,590
I haven't even noticed.

70
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,620
I wish you a happy new year.

71
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,620
Why did you wish in advance?

72
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,830
No sincerity at all.

73
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,340
You should wish me well

74
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,430
at zero o'clock

75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,620
on the night of Lunar New Year's Eve.

76
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,870
It's just a greeting.

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,900
Why all the trouble?

78
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,030
Writing and sending a message

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,510
isn't a hassle. It's called effort.

80
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,540
I know.

81
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,460
I mean

82
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,220
who would bother?

83
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,900
Someone who really cares about you.

84
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,590
When the old year is about to end

85
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,390
and the new one is about to begin,

86
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,750
people who think of you

87
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,750
will do so.

Put it on.

119
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,660
How are you?

120
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,270
Not bad.

121
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,060
You have grown up.

122
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,820
You've lost weight.

123
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,540
I'm cold.

124
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,780
I already gave you my coat.

125
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,580
But I'm still cold.

126
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,540
Why don't you wear more layers?

127
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,230
I came all the way from Qiongzhou.

128
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,900
I didn't know your hometown is so cold.

129
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,270
I'm only wearing like this

130
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,150
because I want to see you.

131
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,030
Silly girl.

132
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,390
This is the warmest.

133
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,990
Let me take you to my house.

134
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,270
All right.

135
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,470
What ethnic group is this?

136
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,030
Their clothes are nice.

137
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,660
They are Qiang people.

138
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,540
Qiang? Which Qiang?

139
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,030
Qiang flute.

140
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,230
"Qiang flute complains about the willows

141
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,660
and the spring breeze does
not pass through Yumen Pass."

142
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,750
Have you heard this poem?

143
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,540
Yes.

144
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,060
So this is where the Qiang people live.

145
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,060
This is the village where
the Qiang and Han people live.

146
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,060
Are you back together?

147
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,630
Is this your girlfriend?

148
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,940
No, she's not.

149
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,900
Take care.

150
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,900
What is your ethnicity?

151
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,180
I am a Han.

152
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,420
Too bad.

153
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Do you like their clothes?

154
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,540
I have several new sets at home.

155
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,150
I'll bring it to you.

156
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,820
Do you think I will look good in it?

157
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,510
Han.

158
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,150
Will I?

159
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,060
Be careful.

160
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,580
There's a step.

161
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,580
What did the grandma tell you just now?

162
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,540
She said you are beautiful.

163
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,580
Dialects and Qiang language
are difficult to understand.

164
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Quanquan?

165
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,820
I am not Quanquan.

166
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,230
I am her sister, Tongtong.

167
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,750
Quanquan went to grandma's house.

168
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,990
Hello.

169
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,540
You're awake.

170
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,910
You slept the whole day

171
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,140
and haven't eaten.

172
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,100
Uncle didn't want me to wake you up

173
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,620
so you can sleep in peace.

174
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,620
Where's your uncle?

175
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,060
He's making dinner.

176
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,820
Does he cook at home?

177
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,430
No, he never cooked.

178
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,470
He cooks because you're here.

179
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,860
Sister, you know what?

180
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,990
My uncle likes you so much.

181
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,780
He's willing to do anything for you.

182
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,670
You are so sweet.

183
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,750
You're not sent here

184
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,860
by your uncle to cheer me up, are you?

185
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,230
No.

186
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,270
My uncle is not that kind of person.

187
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,910
I can tell by the way he looks at you.

188
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,380
I also know about you two
in Xiaozhou Village.

189
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,140
Amazing.

190
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,510
Sister, be careful.

191
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,820
Thank you.

192
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
No problem.

193
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,230
Here.

194
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,430
Come on, eat.

195
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,100
She is my mother.

196
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,860
She is a Qiang.

197
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,620
My father is a Han.

198
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,270
I take my father's surname.

199
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,780
Hello, madam.

200
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,430
I'll enjoy the meal.

201
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,910
I've been hungry today.

202
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,340
Try my uncle's cooking.

203
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,430
Your mother will have
nothing to eat. Stop it.

204
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,300
Thank you.

205
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,620
Delicious.

206
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,950
Xiao Han.

207
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,910
Why doesn't your mother say anything

208
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,230
and just smile at me?

209
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,860
She's been in this village all her life

210
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,100
and hasn't travelled much.

211
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,620
So she's not very good
at speaking Mandarin.

212
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,470
She's afraid you won't understand.

213
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,270
Then you can translate for me.

214
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,270
Do you want to chat with her?

215
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,510
Eat up.

216
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,230
Okay, let me translate for you.

217
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,820
You tell her

218
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,910
that we're just friends.

219
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,430
not that you're bringing
your future wife home

220
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,100
to meet your parents.

221
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,580
She mustn't get the wrong idea.

222
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,670
Are you sure?

223
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,950
Yes.

224
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,510
Why, are you not sure?

225
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,190
Okay.

226
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,580
I'll tell her exactly what you said.

227
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,540
Can I make her my wife?

228
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,060
We have a guest in our home.

229
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,910
She is a beautiful,

230
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,540
nice lady.

231
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,750
Go ahead.

232
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,140
She said she didn't misunderstand you

233
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,620
and told you not to feel pressured

234
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,910
since you're here as a guest.

235
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,100
She said there's
a lot to see around here

236
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,670
and asked if you wanted
to go for a walk.

237
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,140
Did you translate it correctly?

238
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,540
Then why is your mother looking so calm

239
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,910
and happy now?

240
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,430
Eat up.

241
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,470
Kid.

242
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,710
Did you understand

243
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,950
what they said to each other?

244
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,190
Tell me.

245
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,380
Did your uncle translate as I said?

246
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,860
He didn't lie.

247
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,540
My uncle never lied.

248
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,620
Unlike you. You don't mean what you say.

249
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,300
Hurry up and eat.

250
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,230
Eat up.

251
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Your uncle has quite the composure.

252
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,060
If he does,

253
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,340
he wouldn't have picked you up.

254
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,340
Then

255
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,380
it's not just me

256
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,300
who's not speaking my mind.

257
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,670
He's the same.

258
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,100
Xiao Han

259
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,030
Is there no reception here?

260
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,190
I'd like to make a phone call later.

261
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,780
You need to get to the top
of the hill to get a signal.

262
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,380
Eat up. I will take you up
after you're done.

263
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,190
Are you ready?

264
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,750
Yes.

265
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,820
It's cold up there. Wear more layers.

266
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,860
I like your down jacket.

267
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,030
The colour is nice and it's very warm.

268
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,190
If you like it, you can have it.

269
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,380
Are you sure?

270
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,750
I didn't realise

271
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,670
you are so generous.

272
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,910
Then what is your most valuable thing?

273
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,620
Take it out and give it to me.

274
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,340
Hold this.

275
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,470
I want something valuable.

276
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,380
It is valuable.

277
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,380
What is this?

278
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,750
Oxygen bottle.

279
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,030
Why do you give me this?

280
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,780
This is a plateau with a high altitude.

281
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,100
You may get altitude sickness up there.

282
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,470
Bring this just in case.

283
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,540
You're afraid I'll run out of oxygen.

284
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,380
You will be there with me.

285
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,620
You can give me oxygen.

286
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,340
Wait for me.

287
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,670
The nearby base station is
undergoing maintenance.

288
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,100
The signal is not stable.

289
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,300
I can't walk anymore.

290
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,030
You are too weak.

291
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,540
You should exercise more.

292
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,140
I wouldn't have
bothered to walk this far

293
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,670
if I hadn't followed you.

294
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,750
I never thought

295
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,670
I'd be climbing a mountain
for the first time in my life

296
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,140
to find a signal.

297
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,230
Slow down.

298
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,510
We'll be there soon.

299
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,990
Liar. There's still a long way to go.

300
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,190
It's just up ahead.

301
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,910
There is a signal.

302
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,820
Mother.

303
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,470
I'm hanging out with
my classmates in the mountain.

304
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,540
Don't worry.

305
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,710
The signal here is poor.

306
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,140
I can't hear you.

307
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,750
Anyway, don't worry.

308
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,060
I'll send you photos

309
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,140
and messages in the next few days.

310
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,620
Okay.

311
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,270
I'll hang up now.

312
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,990
Bye. The signal is poor.

313
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,300
Xiao Han.

314
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,190
There is no signal in the village.

315
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,750
So how come you picked up

316
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,990
the phone right away

317
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,780
when I called you
on Lunar New Year's Eve?

318
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,190
I happened to be strolling

319
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,820
at the top of the hill.

320
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,820
You've got nothing better to do

321
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,060
than to go for a walk on top of
a hill in the middle of winter.

322
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,990
It can be over
ten degrees below zero at night.

323
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,780
And there are lots of mosquitoes here.

324
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,910
No mosquitoes in winter.

325
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,190
That's not the point.

326
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,860
The point is

327
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,580
how did you know I would call you?

328
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,270
Was it because

329
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,060
you texted me?

330
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,710
I stopped using that number
a long time ago.

331
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,300
How long would you have waited here

332
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,950
if I hadn't read that message?

333
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,380
One hour?

334
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,540
One night?

335
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,100
One day?

336
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,380
Or longer?

337
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,340
I'll be waiting.

338
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,910
Silly.

339
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,060
A meteor.

340
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,860
We can really see a meteor here.

341
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,750
He Ran.

342
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,230
In future, if you have any wishes,

343
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,860
just tell me.

344
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,470
I'd like to ask you a question.

345
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,580
Why gerberas?

346
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,910
Shouldn't you be growing roses?

347
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,190
It's because of the blooming season.

348
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,540
Gerberas bloom late.

349
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,820
When they bloom, the other flowers fade.

350
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,470
I know.

351
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,540
You are trying to say that...

352
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,990
You are my last woman.

353
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,510
Got it.

354
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,780
Xiao Han.

355
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,950
My head hurts.

356
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,620
What's wrong?

357
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,100
Does it hurt here?

358
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,270
It's okay.

359
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,030
It should be altitude sickness.

360
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,540
Where's the oxygen bottle
I asked you to bring?

361
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,540
Inhale it and you should be fine.

362
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,430
I find it troublesome.

363
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,030
So I left it on the stool by the door.

364
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,750
Did you do it on purpose?

365
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,030
My head.

366
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,750
I need oxygen.

367
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,060
I need oxygen. Help me.

368
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,030
I can't believe you.

369
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,860
I'm out of oxygen.
I'm going to pass out.

370
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,990
Silly.

371
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,710
This will make you even more hypoxic.

372
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,540
Sister.

373
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,860
You will be

374
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,950
the prettiest girl in our village

375
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,540
in this outfit.

376
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,990
Then you are the cutest girl

377
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,270
in this village.

378
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,580
My uncle has a good taste.

379
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,270
By the way,

380
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,990
grandma said in the morning
that she has a gift for you.

381
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,780
A gift? What kind of gift?

382
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,620
Let's go. I'll take you there.

383
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,990
It fits perfectly.

384
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,340
This is not right.

385
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,750
No.

386
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,300
It's perfect.

387
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,340
I don't think so.

388
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,340
It's perfect for her.

389
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,470
What did your uncle say?

390
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,380
No.

391
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,470
He said it's not

392
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,510
a suitable gift.

393
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,670
Why?

394
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,710
Maybe he's afraid you don't like it.

395
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,820
Who said I don't like it?

396
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,300
Look how beautiful this bracelet is.

397
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,540
It matches my outfit.

398
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,780
I'll take it.

399
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,860
Tell your mother

400
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,670
that I'm grateful

401
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,910
and that I love this gift.

402
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,910
Are you sure?

403
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,230
Yes.

404
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,340
Go ahead.

405
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,750
Mother.

406
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,950
Thank you.

407
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,300
I

408
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,860
don't think

409
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,190
you should take it.

410
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,780
Why not?

411
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,140
It's mine now. I like it.

412
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,620
As you please.

413
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,190
I have to go out for
some errands this afternoon.

414
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,510
Is it okay

415
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,950
if you stay home with Tongtong?

416
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,380
Sure.

417
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,750
Go ahead. I'll wait for you.

418
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,540
Aunt-in-law.

419
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,830
Aunt-in-law.

420
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,620
All the uncles and aunts
in the village are here.

421
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,140
They want to chat with you.

422
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,580
Let me take you to meet them.

423
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,740
But I can't understand them.

424
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,950
Don't worry. Many can speak Mandarin.

425
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,470
And I can be your interpreter.

426
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,260
Let's go.

427
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,430
By the way, what did you
call me just now?

428
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,100
Nothing.

429
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,470
Come on.

430
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,620
Don't make them wait.

431
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,510
Okay.

432
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,790
Be careful.

433
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,140
Sister.

434
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,030
These are gifts from everyone to you.

435
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,580
The villagers are not wealthy,

436
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,740
but they give you

437
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,660
the best things they have.

438
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,660
I hope you like them.

439
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,030
Of course.

440
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,060
Grandma, she is my aunt-in-law.

441
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,620
What do you think of her?

442
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,620
Very good.

443
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,470
Grandma, isn't my aunt-in-law pretty?

444
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,220
Pretty.

445
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,660
She's pretty.

446
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,990
Little sister, look.

447
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,700
Is my aunt-in-law pretty?

448
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,660
Pretty.

449
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,910
You are so sweet.

450
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,790
This is for you.

451
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,830
Tongtong.

452
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,990
Everyone is so friendly.

453
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,990
Do I have to give something in return?

454
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,990
That will be better.

455
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,220
Should I transfer them money

456
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,390
through WeChat?

457
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,140
No.

458
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,790
The villagers

459
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,030
don't use that kind of thing.

460
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,790
Is there any ATM near here?

461
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,180
I will give them cash.

462
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,910
Our customs

463
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,790
are different from
those of your big city.

464
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,180
Nobody gives money.

465
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,260
They give items in return.

466
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,700
Then what can I give?

467
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,870
Tell me. I'll buy them.

468
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,140
Peanuts,

469
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,100
red dates, longan, etc.

470
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,260
It's a good symbol.

471
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,910
Everyone will be happy to receive it.

472
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,030
Okay, no problem.

473
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,660
Let's go buy them.

474
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,830
I'll give them each a gift in return.

475
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,700
Okay.

476
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,140
I'll be off.

477
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,510
- Bye.
- Take care.

478
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,350
Goodbye.

479
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,430
Handsome man.

480
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,180
Congratulations.

481
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,060
Han, congratulations.

482
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,140
I wish you all happiness.

483
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,100
You are back.

484
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,060
Why do you look so happy?

485
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,910
Of course I'm happy.

486
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,740
You know what?

487
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,060
I really like it here.

488
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,310
Look at these things.

489
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,870
They were gifts from the people here.

490
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,260
They came to see me in the afternoon.

491
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,220
Tongtong also taught me
to return gifts to them.

492
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,220
I've bought everything

493
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,390
and gave them one by one.

494
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,390
You returned their gifts?

495
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,260
Yes.

496
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,830
Do you want to eat this? It's sweet.

497
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,700
Wait for me.

498
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,660
Tongtong.

499
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,310
Tongtong.

500
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,060
Uncle.

501
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,910
Don't fool around like that next time.

502
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,430
Then let me explain to her.

503
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,740
What's wrong?

504
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,870
Have a baby soon!

505
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,910
I have something to do.
I'll be out for a while.

506
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,470
So when are we going to have a baby?

507
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,540
Xiao Han.

508
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,060
What's wrong?

509
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,060
Are you asleep?

510
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,740
Yes.

511
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,790
I'm cold. I can't sleep.

512
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,830
Xiao Han.

513
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,790
Coming.

514
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,140
This is the goose down blanket

515
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,990
my mother made today.

516
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,950
Use this and you'll feel better.

517
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,950
Lie down.

518
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,030
Sleep early.

519
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,030
Goodnight.

520
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,510
Xiao Han.

521
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,310
Are you still up?

522
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,950
The blanket is too thin.

523
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,430
I'm still cold and can't sleep.

524
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,790
Go back to your room.
I'll be right over.

525
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,620
What is this?

526
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,660
Foot warmer.

527
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,510
I put hot water inside for you.

528
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,100
It's often used

529
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,470
to keep the villager warm in the winter.

530
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,140
It should be warm in a few minutes.

531
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,510
Sleep tight.

532
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,390
Why are you here again?

533
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,660
It's too cold. I need to sleep.

534
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,580
What about the foot warmer?

535
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,620
It has cooled off.

536
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,140
I'll get you some hot water.

537
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,310
No.

538
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,540
It's late. Don't trouble yourself.
Go to sleep.

539
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,990
What about you?

540
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,470
I'm sleepy, too. I want to sleep.

541
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
Don't worry.

542
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,470
I promise I'll just sleep

543
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,740
and do nothing.
