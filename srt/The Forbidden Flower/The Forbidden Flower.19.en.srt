=The Forbidden Flower=

2
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,740
=Episode 19=

3
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,750
He Ran.

4
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,310
Are you

5
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,750
looking for Xiao Han?

6
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,960
Yes, I am Xiao Han's old friend.

7
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,920
I came to see him about something,

8
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,900
but he wasn't here.
I was just about to leave.

9
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,560
Your phone

10
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,800
is ringing.

11
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,630
Won't you answer it?

12
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,430
Yes.

13
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,800
I found the buyer. He is a big boss.

14
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,190
He's willing to pay a high price,

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,360
but he'd like to see the painting first.

16
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Can you get the painting?

17
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
The buyer asked me
to reply to him today.

18
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm in the middle of something.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,960
I'll call you later. Bye.

20
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,280
Well, since Xiao Han is not here,

21
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,150
I will leave.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,910
Goodbye.

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,590
Wait.

24
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,560
Yes?

25
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,870
What's your name?

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,800
My name is Qin Zao.

27
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Qin Zao.

28
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,280
Okay, I'll remember it.

29
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,430
Eat more.

30
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,160
Fatty.

31
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,870
What's wrong with Xiao Han recently?

32
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,240
He's not home every day

33
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,270
and I can't get through to his phone.

34
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,310
He's disappeared.

35
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,000
Did he take on some urgent job?

36
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,070
I saw him at

37
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,240
the building materials
market the other day,

38
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,510
saying he was
renovating some house.

39
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Renovation?

40
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,510
He's good at everything, I guess.

41
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,920
See?

42
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,630
You're too young to understand.

43
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,920
The more talented a man is,

44
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
the busier he is

45
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,870
and the busier he is, the better.

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,920
Listen. When Xiao walks
around Xiaozhou Village,

47
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,870
all the ladies gaze at him

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
and want to jump on him.

49
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,390
Let's not talk about him today.

50
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,520
I need to have a word with you.

51
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,560
Look at you.

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,510
Every time you pass by my place here,

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
you don't even look inside.

54
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,680
You go straight to Xiao's place.

55
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,950
Still,

56
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm being

57
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,830
generous enough

58
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,640
to come here and eat with you.

59
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,750
Don't be shy. Eat up!

60
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,560
Zhang.

61
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,750
Give us chicken wings.

62
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
This lady here needs to eat.

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,830
Look how thin she looks. Eat.

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,070
Fatty.

65
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,800
Do you think

66
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,160
Xiao Han is really busy

67
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,070
or is he annoyed with me, avoiding me

68
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,720
and no longer wants me?

69
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,600
You asked me three questions.

70
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,240
Firstly, he's really busy.

71
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,320
Secondly, he won't be annoyed with you.

72
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,190
Third,

73
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,000
he will never abandon you.

74
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,600
You, on the other hand,

75
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,480
don't you ever abandon him.

76
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,950
That won't happen, okay?

77
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,190
Listen.

78
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Xiao Han

79
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,480
loves you to the core.

80
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,070
No one knows Xiao

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,830
better than I do.

82
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
After all these years

83
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,310
of being on his own,

84
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,070
it's not easy for him

85
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,510
to open his heart

86
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
to a woman.

87
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,870
So I hope

88
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,160
you won't let him down

89
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,120
or leave him.

90
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,360
I, He Ran,

91
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
would never leave him.

92
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,000
How could I possibly dump him?

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,720
- Great.
- I love him so much.

94
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
- Come on.
- Gosh.

95
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,920
Cheers.

96
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm glad to hear that.

97
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,430
Drink slowly. This alcohol is strong.

98
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
If you drink too much,
Xiao will give me a hard time.

99
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,120
Are you afraid of Xiao?

100
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,360
You know what?

101
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,040
I give him trouble every day.

102
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,600
But I will behave more.

103
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,200
Let's eat more.

104
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,200
Fatty.

105
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,600
I'll tell you a secret.

106
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,790
What is it?

107
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,720
This is

108
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
my first time drinking alcohol.

109
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,960
Your first time.

110
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm happy.

111
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,550
No.

112
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,320
Stop. Listen.

113
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,750
You can get drunk.

114
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,030
I won't, really.

115
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,790
Xiao.

116
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Chicken wings!

117
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Hurry up.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,720
Coming.

119
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,550
Stop drinking. Eat up.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,390
Look. It's empty.

121
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,150
Flower pot.

122
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,390
Xiao Han.

123
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,750
Qin Zao?

124
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,750
It's you again.

125
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,510
Where is Xiao Han?

126
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,030
He's not home.

127
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,960
Then how did you get in?

128
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,550
The door...

129
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,910
The door is not locked.

130
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,200
Since you are back,

131
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
then I'll go first.

132
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
Wait.

133
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,320
Explain to me.

134
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,270
What is going on?

135
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,840
If you didn't want the money,

136
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,630
you could have just given it back to me.

137
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,440
Why did you have to go to Xiao Han?

138
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,080
It's not what you think it is.

139
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,240
Then tell me.

140
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Are you hiding something from Xiao Han?

141
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,000
Or else what are you trying

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,790
to do here today?

143
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,720
No, I don't mean any harm to Xiao Han.

144
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,760
This is a bit complicated,

145
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
but don't worry,

146
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,320
I'm not trying to break you two up.

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,630
Do you think I'll believe it?

148
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,440
Do you think you can fool me?

149
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,840
Money.

150
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,030
I owe too much money

151
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,600
and the debt collectors really...

152
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,150
Then why did you reject my card?

153
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
This money is not enough

154
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,120
to solve any problems!

155
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,360
No, I didn't mean that.

156
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,840
What exactly do you want?

157
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,960
Is this not even enough?

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't go overboard!

159
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,200
No, I'm not.

160
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,030
Are you not feeling well?

161
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:03,750
Wait.

162
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Don't touch me.

163
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,390
I really didn't mean that.

164
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,320
I'll ask you one last time.

165
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,910
Are you going to leave or not?

166
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,670
Fine.

167
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,750
Please behave yourself.

168
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,200
He Ran.

169
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,440
He Ran.

170
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,630
Don't scare me, He Ran.

171
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,030
He Ran.

172
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,320
Wake up, He Ran.

173
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,020
Hello.

174
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,150
Did you get the painting?

175
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,750
Hurry up.

176
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,790
Ambulance?

177
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,670
A girl collapsed in Xiaozhou Village.

178
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,750
Can you come and pick her up?

179
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,270
Okay, thank you.

180
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,270
He Ran.

181
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,030
He Ran.

182
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,240
Where have you been?

183
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,360
Why didn't you answer the phone?

184
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,660
Hello.

185
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,270
He Ran fainted.

186
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,910
How is it?

187
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,150
How do you feel? Better?

188
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,720
Why are you here?

189
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,360
I called you and a woman answered.

190
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,720
She said you fainted.

191
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,960
So I went to pick you up.

192
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,960
Where is that woman?

193
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,510
Outside the ward.

194
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't think she is a good person.

195
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,750
So I didn't let her in.

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,910
Slowly.

197
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,030
What is going on with you?

198
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,030
Aren't you usually fine?

199
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,600
Why did you suddenly have an episode?

200
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm fine. Don't make a fuss.

201
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,150
I'm just having a fever.

202
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,880
Your fever is not the same as a normal person's.

203
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,150
What do you mean?

204
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Am I not a normal person?

205
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,720
No, I...

206
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,510
I didn't mean that.

207
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,960
Don't keep picking on me.

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,480
How about this?

209
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,960
I will call my aunt

210
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
to give you a check-up.

211
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,840
Okay?

212
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,080
No need. I'm fine.

213
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,550
Don't be stubborn.

214
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,600
Do you have a death wish?

215
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,720
Be careful.

216
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,670
Han Yu.

217
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,720
I cherish my life

218
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,030
more than anyone else right now.

219
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
No.

220
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,200
He Ran, I mean

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,870
it's better to have my aunt come

222
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,390
and give you a good examination.

223
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,150
No.

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,870
Where are you going?

225
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,600
Toilet.

226
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,790
Stop following me.

227
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,030
Also, don't tell my mother

228
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,240
about today.

229
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,150
Hold it higher.

230
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,910
Beware of backflow.

231
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,790
She has leukemia?

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Yes.

233
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,790
She's stable now.

234
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,120
She usually looks quite healthy.

235
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
She still needs to stay for observation.

236
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,960
Thank you.

237
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,960
If you have anything to ask, just ask.

238
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,030
No, I just...

239
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,120
Do you have leukemia?

240
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,360
It was cured,

241
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
but now it's relapsing.

242
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,750
What's with that response?

243
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,360
It's not like I'm going to die tomorrow.

244
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,030
Anyway,

245
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,720
I think you are a kind girl.

246
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,750
I still

247
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,910
wish you well.

248
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,720
Thank you.

249
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,750
Thank you for saying

250
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,320
I am a kind girl.

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,750
Does Xiao Han know?

252
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,670
He doesn't.

253
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,870
Aren't you going to tell him?

254
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,390
He doesn't understand the disease.

255
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,960
Knowing it will only add to the trouble.

256
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,960
I don't want you to tell him, either.

257
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,390
But...

258
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,030
Because I'm not a kind girl.

259
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,670
The one who is truly kind is Xiao Han.

260
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,600
If he knows about my disease,

261
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,150
he will never leave me.

262
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,240
The only way I can leave him

263
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,440
on my own accord is if he doesn't know.

264
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,870
Which outcome do you prefer?

265
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,870
Thank you.

266
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,440
Sorry.

267
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,510
We need to have the painting

268
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,640
authenticated by a professional.

269
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,000
No problem.

270
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,440
Is the painting really

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,640
worth that much, as you quoted before?

272
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,960
Of course,

273
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,510
but only if

274
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,830
the painting is real.

275
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,590
I heard that the painter

276
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,590
has passed away.

277
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,070
Yes.

278
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,310
If not mistaken, it was many years ago.

279
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,480
I met him once at a painting exhibition.

280
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,440
Are you sure?

281
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,920
Yes, it's a fake.

282
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,830
I'm sorry, Ms. Qin.

283
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm afraid we can't buy this painting.

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,830
This is impossible.

285
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,030
My ex-husband

286
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,440
had this painting
authenticated by a specialist.

287
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
It's definitely real. Look.

288
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,070
The handwritten signature
and stamp are here.

289
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,310
This is definitely authentic.

290
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,960
Your ex-husband?

291
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,110
Is he

292
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,200
a professional

293
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,720
authenticator of painting?

294
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
Not really.

295
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,720
He was a co-owner of a gallery,

296
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
but he must surely know something

297
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,680
about such an expensive painting.

298
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm sorry,

299
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
but our deal

300
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,510
is definitely not going to work out.

301
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,350
Wait.

302
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,110
I am confident about this.

303
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,400
Get some more experts

304
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,350
to take a good look at it.

305
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,550
No need.

306
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,510
If I may ask, where did you

307
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,310
get this painting from?

308
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,790
I

309
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,680
got it from a salon in Xiaozhou Village.

310
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,310
It's not really a salon.

311
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,830
It's my friend's

312
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,350
garden workshop.

313
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,790
I thought my ex-husband
would know something

314
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,240
about such an expensive painting.

315
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,510
I also didn't believe it at first.

316
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,480
I should never have believed

317
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,790
that such a good thing
could happen to me.

318
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,400
I may be a little out of my depth.

319
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm sorry

320
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,960
to have taken up your time.

321
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll go first.

322
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,640
I have done what you ordered.

323
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,160
Zhang Yuanqi.

324
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,920
Why are you dressed like that?

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,760
There's a client
appreciation dinner tonight.

326
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't try to fool me.

327
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,400
I never saw you dressed like this before

328
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,350
at more formal events.
Where are you going?

329
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,790
I'm in a relationship.

330
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,830
Tonight is our first official date.

331
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,680
Really? Who is she?

332
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm in a rush.

333
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,070
Tell me.

334
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,960
I'll introduce her to you some day.

335
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Zhang Yuanqi, how could you?

336
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,510
Look how antsy you are.

337
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,680
In a relationship?

338
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,830
Who could she be?

339
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,720
Why all the secrecy?

340
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,440
I wonder if I know her.

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,680
This doesn't look like

342
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,340
my brother's painting style either.

343
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,460
(He Ran)

344
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,110
He Ran?

345
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,000
Is it the He Ran I know?

346
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,310
How did they know each other?

347
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,030
No. Isn't He Ran in
a relationship with Xiao Han?

348
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,310
I'm in a relationship.

349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,160
Could it be that they...

350
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,780
Hello.

351
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,960
What's the matter?

352
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,640
Do you know He Ran?

353
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,960
Yes, she is my junior.

354
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,750
Are you two dating?

355
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,310
What are you thinking?

356
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,400
Sister, I have to hang up.

357
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,070
The signal is bad here.

358
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,720
Talk to you later. Bye

359
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,300
Hello?

360
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,070
Zhang Yuanqi.

361
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,860
Hello?

362
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,510
Xiaoli.

363
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,510
What a coincidence.

364
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,070
Did the game just end?

365
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,830
No.

366
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,920
It ended a while ago.

367
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
Did you just get back from a trip?

368
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,440
I don't see He Ran.

369
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,550
You two

370
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,070
have been doing well, right?

371
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,960
There's just one thing

372
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,750
I don't know if I should tell you.

373
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,200
I have a younger brother

374
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,880
who likes to draw too,

375
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,240
but he is

376
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,590
definitely not as good as He Ran.

377
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,000
Anyway, girls' mind changes quickly.

378
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,400
Pay more attention to He Ran.

379
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,400
I have another round
of game. See you.

Here I come.

412
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,000
Have you washed it?

413
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,960
Here.

414
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,720
Sit down.

415
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,400
Thank you so much

416
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,680
for coming here to fix the toilet again.

417
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,790
Mrs. Qiu is not at home today.

418
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,880
Take a break and have
a glass of water before you go.

419
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,300
(Young Boy)

420
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,860
Hello.

421
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,550
I didn't see you. Are you here yet?

422
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,270
I've got a situation here.

423
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,920
I'll be there later.

424
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,590
Okay.

425
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,880
I'll be waiting for you. See you.

426
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,310
My daughter took after him.

427
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
She painted epiphyllum

428
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,550
and hung it on
the ceiling of her bedroom,

429
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,960
which surprised me.

430
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,030
What are you two doing?

431
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,790
I think this is not
a very good painting.

432
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,880
I want to turn it over.

433
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,790
Why are you sneaking around?

434
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Didn't I ask you to get changed?

435
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,110
Why haven't you changed?

436
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,680
Since he is Mr. Han's friend,

437
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,440
we can't afford to be rude.

438
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,550
Go and make a nice pot of tea.

439
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,400
Invite him in.

440
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,590
Mother.

441
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,550
Let's just

442
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,880
forget it. Don't interfere

443
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,590
with his work.

444
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,590
It's him.

445
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,460
(Young Boy)

446
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,260
(Young Boy)

447
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,100
(Lady Boss)

448
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,960
Here.

449
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,920
Slowly.

450
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,550
You've just had your blood drawn.

451
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,110
Lie down and get some rest.

452
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,310
Han Yu.

453
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,310
I'm thirsty.

454
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,750
Can you get me some water?

455
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,070
Okay.

456
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,700
Hello.

457
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,750
I miss you.

458
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,200
Me, too.

459
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,400
I've been busy and haven't
been able to talk to you.

460
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,480
Are you done with your work now?

461
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,240
Yes.

462
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,350
Do you want to come and see me?

463
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,590
I'm so forgetful.

464
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,750
You have water here.

465
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,830
You...

466
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,880
Why are you wearing a jacket?

467
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,000
He Ran.

468
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,680
You can't leave.

469
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,240
The...

470
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,440
The test results haven't come out yet.

471
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,160
Besides, my aunt is already on the way.

472
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,880
She told me to watch over you.

473
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,200
This is important. I have to go out.

474
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,920
Wait.

475
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,200
Is it much more
important than your life?

476
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,680
if you keep doing like this,

477
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm going to call your mother.

478
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,350
No.

479
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,000
If you call my mother,
I'm done with you.

480
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,200
You...

481
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,440
Give me back.

482
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,270
Do whatever you want.

483
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,590
If something happens to you,

484
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,440
both of us

485
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,310
will

486
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,310
be doomed.

487
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,110
I'm just anaemic.

488
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,160
I'm really fine.

489
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,440
You can't fool me. If something...

490
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,920
No.

491
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,920
He...

492
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
He...

493
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,830
He Ran.

494
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You...

495
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,240
Listen. Stop kidding me.

496
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,070
Are you putting on a show?

497
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,590
He Ran.

498
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,960
He Ran?

499
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,680
Doctor, nurse.

500
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,880
Quick! Someone's fainted!

501
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,640
He Ran.

502
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,550
He Ran.

503
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,920
Do you hear me? He Ran.

504
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,240
She passed out.

505
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,680
Hurry up.

506
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,830
Mother.

507
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,590
No, I mean Mrs. Qiu.

508
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,110
He Ran fainted again.

509
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,110
You should hurry over.

510
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
I know you're not asleep.

511
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,440
Stop pretending.

512
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,190
I don't want to say too much.

513
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,110
Break up with him.

514
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,630
I love him.

515
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
Does he know you're sick?

516
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,360
Tell me.

517
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,280
Does he know you're sick?

518
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,880
Tell me!

519
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,070
How long have you been
sneaking out of the house?

520
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,230
How long are you going
to keep this from me?

521
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,070
