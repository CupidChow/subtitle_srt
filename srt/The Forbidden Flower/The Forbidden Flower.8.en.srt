Who put them back?

Who put them back?

7
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,440
Who?

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,440
I did.

9
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,160
He Ran.

10
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Please.

11
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,370
Put all this

12
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,850
away.

13
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,200
He Ran.

14
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,440
Can you be considerate of me?

15
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,640
Considerate?

16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,880
Why?

17
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,720
Are you even bothered

18
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,160
by father's stuff now?

19
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,780
He's gone.

20
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,250
Your father is gone.

21
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,690
What do you want me to do,

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,010
look at these things and cry every day?

23
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,530
Ranran.

24
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,010
After all these years,

25
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,880
I don't even have
the courage to move on.

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
I've cared enough about your feelings.

27
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,920
I've tried so hard to understand you.

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,850
No, you haven't.

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,480
I...

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,690
You're not trying to understand me.

31
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,160
You're controlling me.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm controlling you?

33
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,720
For what?

34
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,880
Can you take care of yourself?

35
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,040
Everything I do is for your own good.

36
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,440
I control you? What did I do?

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
You're not doing it for me!

38
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,410
You're doing it for yourself.

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,130
You want me to live the way you do.

40
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,440
Shut up.

41
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,480
Now you're throwing
away all father's stuff.

42
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,810
Are you trying to find
a new man out there?

43
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,760
Shut up!

44
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,320
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,970
Ranran.

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,370
I...

47
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,250
I didn't mean it.

48
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,370
Ranran.

49
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,730
I didn't mean it.

50
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,010
I was too emotional.

51
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
Ranran, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,640
I won't die.

53
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,810
Can you stop saying that word?

54
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,050
Why?

55
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,370
Isn't it better if I die?

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
If I also died,

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
you'll have no burden

58
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,370
and you can go on with your new life.

59
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,250
Mother.

60
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:53,840
Is that...

61
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,250
Is that what you think of your mother?

62
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,440
Do you think your mother
is that kind of a person?

63
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
Or what?

64
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,610
Calm down.

65
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,080
Don't be so impulsive.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,130
It's raining outside.

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,400
Ran.

68
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
I see.

69
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,520
You are just like your father.

70
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,080
You and your father are the same.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,880
You're selfless

72
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,640
and you're the greatest.

73
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,280
Your father could just leave

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
and you could, too.

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,370
You are not afraid of anything,

76
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,400
not even death.

77
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,280
I am...

78
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,490
I am the weakest.

79
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm afraid of everything.

80
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,880
Go.

81
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,840
Leave.

82
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,570
Just leave!

83
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,640
Go.

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,130
If you want to be free,

85
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,810
you can go.

86
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,250
No one controls you.

87
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,010
You're not even afraid of death.

88
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,170
Take your father's things with you.

89
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,760
You are finally back.

90
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,130
My legs are numb.

91
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,520
Thank you.

92
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,680
Slowly, it's hot.

93
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,040
Thank you.

94
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,680
Thank you.

95
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,040
I...

96
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,490
I didn't mean to trouble you.

97
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,450
I really have nowhere to go.

98
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,800
I couldn't find the key to the studio.

99
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,280
If I wanted to

100
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,010
stay here for the night,

101
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,880
would you ask me to leave?

102
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,880
I can sleep on the sofa.

103
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,090
You can sleep in the bedroom upstairs.

104
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,880
What about you?

105
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,520
I've got some plants to look after
in the greenhouse tonight.

106
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,520
I'll be up late.

107
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,490
There are new sheets
and blankets in the cupboard.

108
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,610
Okay.

109
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,250
Come in.

110
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,560
Is the epiphyllum still here?

111
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,560
Has it bloomed?

112
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,730
No.

113
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,040
Xiao Han.

114
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,280
Let's make a bet, shall we?

115
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,610
Bet on what?

116
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,040
Let's bet on whether it will

117
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,680
blossom tonight.

118
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,800
It's almost dawn

119
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,520
and the night will soon be over.

120
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,250
It's okay.

121
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,800
Just bet on tonight.

122
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,880
Bet on what?

123
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,850
If it blooms,

124
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,970
we will

125
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,490
be together.

126
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,160
If it doesn't,

127
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,130
will you give up?

128
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,800
If the epiphyllum doesn't bloom tonight,

129
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,450
I'll give up.

130
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,850
I will

131
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,800
never come to you again.

132
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,370

(The number you've dialed)

159
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,280
(is currently unavailable.)

160
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
(Please try again later.)

161
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,080
What's going on?

162
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,690
Why can't I reach her?

163
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,650
Mrs. Qiu, maybe it's not
that you can't get through.

164
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,650
It's just that
the phone is dead again

165
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,730
and turned off itself.

166
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,760
Well,

167
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,040
I think Ran must have gone to

168
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,890
Yu's house.

169
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,760
After all, they grew up together.

170
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,760
Don't worry, Mrs. Qiu.

171
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,450
Han Yu doesn't pick up either.

172
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,520
Yu is probably still
sleeping at this hour.

173
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,760
He'll definitely call you back

174
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,450
when he wakes up.

175
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,010
What's going on?

176
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,930
No one in the family answers my calls.

177
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,690
No.

178
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm going over there now.

179
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,690
Mrs. Qiu.

180
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,600
Mrs. Qiu, please calm down.

181
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,890
Why don't you wait here?

182
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,890
Think about it.

183
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,210
You and Ran are both still in a rage.

184
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
What if you get into a fight again?

185
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,280
I'll go.

186
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,210
I'll go and look for her, okay?

187
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,890
I'll see how Ran is handling it

188
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
before you decide
if you want to go yourself.

189
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,650
Go ahead.

190
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,760
Now.

191
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,690
Right away.

192
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,760
Xiao Han.

193
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,650
Xiao Han.

194
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,930
Xiao Han.

195
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Who are you?

196
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,840
What time is it? Let me sleep.

197
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,210
Yu, you finally answered my call.

198
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,450
Is Ran at your house?

199
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,010
Yu?

200
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,040
No.

201
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,890
I'll go to you right away.

202
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,930
Zhang.

203
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,970
Clean my car. Hurry up.

204
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,600
I'll visit Mr. Liang.

205
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,410
No, I'm not asking you to clean my car.

206
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,520
I'll talk to you later.

207
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,250
Thank you. You may hang up first.

208
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,010
Bye.

209
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,970
Bye.

210
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,280
Gosh, Mr. Liang.

211
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,490
Where did you come from?

212
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,320
Here.

213
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,040
Here?

214
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,080
What's wrong with the sad face?

215
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,760
Have you seen Xiao Han?

216
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,210
He has disappeared again.

217
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,210
Disappeared?

218
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,410
It's Sunday.

219
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,840
He should have gone to
the flower, bird and fish market.

220
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,520
Really?

221
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,650
I'll go find him.

222
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,170
Wait.

223
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,250
I'll drive you there.

224
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,730
Zhang, stop it.

225
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,840
No, I run faster.

226
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,490
Run?

227
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,210
Can you be faster than a car?

228
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,800
Gosh.

229
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,490
What a coincidence. You are here, too.

230
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,320
How much is it?

231
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,450
RMB 12.

232
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,560
Your drink.

233
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,280
It's for you.

234
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I fell asleep last night.

235
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,600
Has the epiphyllum bloomed?

236
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,730
I fell asleep, too.

237
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,890
What a shame.

238
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,730
Xiao Han, where are you going to work?

239
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll go with you.

240
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,730
You know what? I just saw Fatty.

241
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,930
He's doing really well recently.

242
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,450
He's gotten rich. He's got a new car.

243
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,970
Gosh. Seriously?

244
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,410
She called you?

245
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,970
She even has your personal phone number.

246
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
What are you talking about?

247
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,250
Han Yu has only one number.

248
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,280
No, what I mean is that

249
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,410
He Ran's caretaker

250
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,600
even has your number.

251
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,010
Yes.

252
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,450
Didn't he tell us before

253
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,730
that the caretaker was
interested in him?

254
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,280
She is so bold.

255
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,490
I can't believe she called him
so early in the morning.

256
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
What did she tell you?

257
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,010
She asked me

258
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,280
if He Ran was at my house.

259
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,250
That was an excuse!

260
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,010
I told her she wasn't around

261
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,490
and she never goes to

262
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
my place for nothing.

263
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,730
What else? What did she ask?

264
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:34,690
Then...

265
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,280
Then,

266
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,450
she sounded very anxious.

267
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,120
So I asked her what was up.

268
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
She told me

269
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,250
she couldn't talk
about it over the phone

270
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,170
and had to tell me in person.

271
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,890
You...

272
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,490
Don't you think this is ridiculous?

273
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,760
It's a setup.

274
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,650
See?

275
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,690
She's a real player.

276
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,690
What are you talking about?

277
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,210
Give me another pot of this.

278
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,250
Okay. There are different colours.

279
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,780
Xiao Han.

280
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,740
- It's blooming season.
- Good morning.

281
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,730
It is the blooming season.

282
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,170
You came at the right time.

283
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,890
Yes.

284
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
Lin.

285
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,360
You're here.

286
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,210
Here.

287
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,890
Help me with this.

288
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,690
These flowers arrived yesterday

289
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,690
and they have become
like this in one night.

290
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,520
There's nothing wrong with

291
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,520
the lighting or the humidity.

292
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,490
I did everything I could.

293
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,250
Take a look.

294
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:38,890
Hello.

295
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,010
Hello.

296
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,490
Is she your friend?

297
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,210
You are quite young. Are you a student?

298
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,250
I'll go for a walk over there.
I'll come back for you later.

299
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,280
You guys get on with it.

300
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,170
Miss, are you looking for roses?

301
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,520
I'm just looking around.

302
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,210
These just arrived
this morning. Buy some.

303
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,210
No, thanks.

304
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,650
You'll get a discount if you buy more.

305
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,800
Ask your boyfriend to buy it for you.

306
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,890
The man who was with you just now.

307
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,840
He must be your boyfriend.

308
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,890
Ask him to buy you some roses.

309
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:22,970
Okay.

310
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,210
I'll ask him to buy me some.

311
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,970
Great. His girlfriend is
so good-looking.

312
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,450
He should give her more flowers.

313
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,360
Exactly.

314
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,490
Have you done browsing?

315
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,520
Are you hungry?

316
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:42,730
Yes.

317
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:51,890
Young man,

318
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,280
buy some flowers for your girlfriend.

319
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,320
The roses are fresh.

320
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,600
Buy some.

321
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,450
Your girlfriend is so pretty.

322
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,970
You should buy more.

323
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,760
No, thanks.

324
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,210
Are you angry?

325
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,600
No.

326
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,410
I didn't say anything.

327
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
She was the one who misunderstood.

328
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,600
She thought

329
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,730
I was your girlfriend.

330
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,840
If you really didn't want her
to take it the wrong way,

331
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,560
you could have just explained to her.

332
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,210
Why should I explain to her?

333
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,010
Of course you should.

334
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,210
Otherwise,

335
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,490
she'd take it seriously

336
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,250
that I am your girlfriend.

337
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,490
He Ran.

338
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,600
This fish looks like you.

339
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,490
It's nothing like me.

340
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,170
I have bigger eyes, okay?

341
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,520
It's been following me.

342
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,930
If it likes you so much,

343
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,760
why don't you buy it?

344
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,280
Take it home and raise it.

345
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,800
No.

346
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,010
It's troublesome.

347
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,970
It's so lovely.

348
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,450
He has no taste.

(Menu)

350
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,010
(Menu)
What would you like to eat?

351
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,170
No need. I'm not hungry.

352
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,410
One wanton noodles.

353
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,280
Okay.

354
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Thank you.

355
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,800
Here you go.

356
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,080
Thank you.

357
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,840
Wait.

358
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:44,840
Ma'am.

359
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,730
Bring me an empty bowl.

360
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,560
- Okay.
- Thanks.

361
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,970
I'll order another bowl for you.

362
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,010
- Ma'am.
- No.

363
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,890
I can't finish it.

364
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,650
I have a small appetite.

365
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:58,970
Thank you.

366
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,120
Do it for me.

367
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,040
Is it enough?

368
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,210
Yes.

369
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,560
Didn't you say you weren't hungry?

370
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:30,970
I'm not hungry.

371
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,120
I just want to eat

372
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,760
from your bowl.

373
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,600
What?

374
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,410
There's a pretty girl
over there peeking at you.

375
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,080
Take a look.

376
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,840
You've mistaken.

377
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,010
No. She is looking at you.

378
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,080
Eat your noodles.

379
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,040
She's really looking at you.

380
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,930
Stop eating.

381
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,040
What's interesting about me?

382
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,250
You're indeed boring.

383
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,210
You're just a grungy working man.

384
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,650
She's probably

385
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,690
as blindsided as I am.

386
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,250
Look how pretty that girl is.

387
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,800
No.

388
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,600
Just take a look.

389
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,930
Come on.

390
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,800
She's pretty.

391
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,600
So who's prettier? Me or her?

392
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,210
She is prettier.

393
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,560
What about me and Man?

394
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,600
Man is prettier than you.

395
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,760
What about me and Xiao Li?

396
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,840
Xiao Li is also prettier than you.

397
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,890
If everyone is prettier than me,

398
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,410
then why are you eating with me?

399
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,210
Maybe it's like you said,

400
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,890
I'm blindsided.

401
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,250
How come?

402
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,560
You've got

403
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,840
a good eye.

404
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,250
Do you think

405
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,040
I would look better

406
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
with a different hairstyle?

407
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,800
I'd look better with
a new hairstyle, right?

408
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,450
You are pretty as you are.

409
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,890
Ma'am, bill, please.

410
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,970
RMB 12.

411
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,520
Am I a bit chubby?

412
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,170
Would it be better if I were thinner?

413
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,320
Just be yourself.

414
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,520
No,

415
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,970
I'm only happy if you like me.

416
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,040
What?

417
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,080
That girl is still peeking at you.

418
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,080
Sir, your change.

419
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,360
They were really looking at you.

420
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,800
Why are you so jealous?

421
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,080
I'm not jealous, I...

422
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,250
What?

423
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,690
Can I hold your arm?

424
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,040
Just this once.

425
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,490
No.
