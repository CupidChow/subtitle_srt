3
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,680
Let me recommend you a movie.

4
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,970
What movie?

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,880
A niche movie.

6
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,970
The episodes are nice.

7
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
You can go watch it.

8
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,370
How niche?

9
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,330
Is it nice?

10
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,440
You'll like it.

11
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,650
What if I don't like it?

12
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,680
Will you be responsible for it?

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,160
How do you want me to
be responsible for it?

14
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,810
I need to watch it at home first.

15
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,770
Sure.

16
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
You can contact me any time.

17
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,840
If

18
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,530
you want me to be responsible for it.

19
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
Xiao Han.

20
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,600
Xiao Han.

21

Xiao Han.

22
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,800
Xiao Han.

23
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,840
Why are you awake?

24
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,160
Why are you not wearing shoes?

25
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,530
Don't move.

26
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,920
Stay there and don't move.

27
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,650
Xiao Han.

28
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,010
Have I said this to you?

29
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,160
I love you.

30
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,840
I said,

31
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,450
I love you.

32
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,530
I love you so much.

33
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,530
Although

34
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I've never

35
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,400
loved anyone like this,

36
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,530
now I know.

37

(Little Child)

76
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,290
Are we meeting up?

77
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,640
No.

78
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,210
Where?

79
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,760
There's a garden in Xiaozhou Village.

80
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,170
We'll meet there.

81
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,810
Okay.

82
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,480
You asked me to come here at midnight.

83
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,760
Do you just want me to take a walk
with you in the garden?

84
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,290
I've never seen you in this dress.

85
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,120
It's nice.

86
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,570
Let me bring you to a place.
Come with me.

87
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,170
Where are we going?

88
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
You'll know when we're there.

89
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,410
I'm fine.

90
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,720
You look good in dress.

91
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,050
I...

92
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm just casually wearing something.

93
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,600
Casual is good.

94
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,300
You can be more casual.

95
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,880
Where are we going?

96
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,000
There's an abandoned cabin.

97
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,160
I always came here with my friends.

98
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,090
A cabin?

99
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,000
The secret base

100
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,450
when you were little?

101
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,720
You can say so.

102
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
This is the cabin.

103
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,840
They used to say that

104
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,170
a demon is staying in here.

105
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,840
It eats the boys passing by.

106
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,760
Only the boys?

107
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,090
Is it a female demon?

108
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,050
I'm not sure of its gender.

109
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,930
It must be a woman.

110
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,000
Otherwise, why would it eat boys?

111
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
What you said makes sense.

112
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,760
It should be a female demon.

113
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,290
Have you never gone in?

114
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,240
No.

115
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,760
I'm timid, so I didn't go in.

116
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,170
But I've always been curious

117
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,240
about what's inside.

118
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,330
You're too timid.

119
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,170
Let's go, little boy.

120
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,290
I'll bring you in

121
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,970
and see what's inside.

122
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,690
There's nothing here.

123
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,330
There's not even a window.

124
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,840
This is the secret base that

125
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,050
I always came when I was little.

126
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,000
Why did you turn off the light?

127
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,290
It's dark here.

128
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,360
Why?

129
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,090
Are you scared?

130
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,240
Scared?

131
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,600
Are you even scary?

132
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,170
You

133
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,330
should be scared of me.

134
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,690
Let's go, female demon.

135
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,880

Your sister and Xiao Han
didn't get married.

Who was messing up with you?

168
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
You promised me yesterday that

169
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,170
you won't come look
for Xiao Han anymore.

170

How could I ever trust you?

172

and he's heavily in debt.

176
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,650
Those debt collectors are crazy.

177
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,960
I was lucky today.

178
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,450
Otherwise, I couldn't have escaped.

179
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,080
Ex-husband.

180
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,930
Since he's your ex-husband,

181
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,800
you should have divorced him.

182
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,800
They should look for him
as he's in debt.

183
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,690
Why did they look for you?

184
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,240
You're still together?

185
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,890
You're suffering together?

186
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,760
It's too complicated
and hard to explain.

187
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,720
Also,

188
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,890
someone is collecting debt from you.

189
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,890
You should call the police.

190
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
Ask the police to help you.

191
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,210
Why did you look for Xiao Han?

192
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,080
We're in the wrong.

193
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
You should look for a place and hide

194
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,520
so that they can't find you.

195
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,210
Isn't that great?

196
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,930
I don't have money.

197
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,240
You were married to a rich foreigner

198
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,520
for many years.

199
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,480
Didn't you save some money for yourself?

200
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,760
Qin Zao,

201
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
you didn't keep a backup.

202
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,610
No, you thought that

203
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,890
your backup is Xiao Han.

204
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,410
I'm sorry.

205
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,000
I really didn't want to trouble you.

206
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,930
Stop it.

207
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,890
Your trick works on Xiao Han,
but not on me.

208
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,280
Hold your tears.

209
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,720
Tell me clearly.

210
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,930
What do you want exactly?

211
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,970
Xiao Han can't give you much money.

212
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,170
I'm not here for money.

213
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm just...

214
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,080
They come to my house to break things
every night.

215
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,930
I'm really

216
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,610
scared.

217
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,460
I just want to talk to him. Can I?

218
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,320
You're not scared
after you've found a man?

219
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,680
That's not what I mean.

220
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,130
What do you mean then?

221
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,890
Help her with the medicine.

222
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,000
No need. I can do it myself.

223
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,280
That's great.

224
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,560
I'm strong.

225
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,170
I might hurt you again.

226
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
What's your plan?

227
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,410
Do you have a place to stay?

228
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,280
Can I...

229
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,280
No, you can't.

230
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm telling you.

231
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,130
You can't stay here.

232
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,760
Not even a second.

233
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,210
No.

234
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,370
I'll book a hotel for you.

235
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,280
What about this?

236
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,210
I know a good place.

237
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,760
I'll bring you there.

238
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,240
Let me send you there.

239
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,720
Let's go.

240
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,940
(Xiaoyeli Inn)

241
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,040
58 plus 50.

242
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,720
Plus ten.

243
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,370
Plus...

244
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,760
Little girl, why are you here?

245
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,890
Why are you looking for me at night?

246
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,210
My friend

247
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,610
wants to stay here for a night.

248
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,520
Do you think it's okay?

249
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,520
Of course.

250
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,080
I have a lot of rooms here.

251
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,850
It's all vacant.
Choose any room you like.

252
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,610
You can stay as long as you want.

253
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,890
You've gone through so much today.

254
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,040
Take a good rest.

255
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm going back to Xiao Han's place.

256
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,720
Go ahead.

257
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,850
Thank you.

258
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,480
I like to fulfill people's wish.

259
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,320
Don't worry.

260
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,210
Bye bye.

261
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,800
The living room in first floor is huge.

262
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,450
The window in second floor is huge.

263
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,650
Which floor do you want to stay in?

264
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,690
Any floor.

265
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,280
Okay.

266
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,080
Second floor then.

267
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,280
Come with me.

268
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,280
Are you thinking of her

269
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,560
or waiting for me?

270
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,280
Waiting for you.

271
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,560
Why didn't you ask me...

272
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,000
About what?

273
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,410
Why didn't you ask me

274
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,720
where I sent her to?

275
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,410
No need to ask anymore.

276
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,760
Stop scratching.

277
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,000
It will only get itchier.

278
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,410
Who is it?

279
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
It's me. Are you awake?

280
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,720
What happened?
You didn't sleep the whole night?

281
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,170
Forget it.

282
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,690
There are too many mosquitoes here.

283
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,930
It's my bad. I forgot to burn
the mosquito coil for you.

284
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,130
I'm sorry.

285
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,850
Since you're awake,

286
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,370
come downstairs.
Someone is looking for you.

287
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,610
Who is it?

288
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,970
Don't be nervous.
It's someone you'd like to see.

289
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,890
Brother-in-law.

290
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,410
I knew you...

291
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,450
Let's talk.

292
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,080
I knew you still care about me.

293
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,370
You won't leave me alone.

294
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,690
This is your sister's insurance claim.

295
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,170
The approval review process
was complicated.

296
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,690
I only got the money

297
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,850
on the second year you left the country.

298
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,280
I didn't use the money.

299
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,560
I'm giving the money to you.

300
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,850
Actually, you've given me a lot.

301
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,240
I didn't work hard.

302
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,170
This is what I can do for you

303
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,520
within my capacity.

304
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,410
I hope you'll stop looking for He Ran.

305
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,370
Do you hear me?

306
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,410
Besides this,

307
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,410
I can give you nothing.

308
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,500
(Bank card)

309
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,130
Who are you looking for?

310
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,610
Let me help you.

311
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,560
Han Yu.

312
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,280
Are you free tomorrow?

313
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,040
My lady.

314
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,040
It's 3 a.m. now. Are you mad?

315
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,720
I'm buying you a meal.
Will you come see me?

316
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,650
What? A meal?

317
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,320
Really?

318
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,210
Is this a formal date?

319
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,480
Let's talk when we meet.
Are you coming or not?

320
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,130
But...

321
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,320
This date is killing me.

322
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,930
You're asking me at 3 a.m.

323
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Fine, I'll be there.

324
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,720
See you tomorrow.

325
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,760
You...

326
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,740
(CAFE)

327
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,080
Here.

328
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,720
I've ordered the food.

329
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,130
Try it.

330
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,850
Stop.

331
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,240
Don't be so annoyed, okay?

332
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,610
You asked me out.

333
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,480
You asked me out at midnight.

334
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,040
You've caused me to

335
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,800
be so hyped and I can't sleep well.

336
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,280
Stop pulling a long face.

337
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,890
Okay.

338
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,450
Let's get straight to the business.

339
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,560
Get straight to the business?

340
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,450
Han Yu,

341
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,800
lend me some money.

342
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,850
Lend you some money?

343
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,800
How much do you want to borrow?

344
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,000
One million.

345
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,650
One million?

346
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,610
Hold on.

347
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,410
For what?

348
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,970
I'll tell you the reason later.

349
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,170
No. You...

350
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,280
One million is not a small amount.

351
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,450
I just need some money urgently.

352
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,040
If you don't tell me the reason,

353
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
I won't lend it to you.

354
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
I'm not using it for

355
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,240
illegal things.

356
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,610
Wait.

357
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,080
He Ran.

358
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,410
Based on your short temper,

359
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
you must have caused
a trouble out there,

360
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,240
am I right?

361
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,560
It's okay. No.

362
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,520
Don't worry.

363
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,080
Tell me if there's anything.
I'll help you.

364
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,720
If I'm not able to help you,

365
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,450
I'll ask my uncle to help you.

366
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,610
Will you lend me the money or not?

367
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,970
Let me tell you.

368
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,610
That's all my saving in there.

369
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
You owe me a sports car.

370
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,850
Don't bother to look for me

371
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,130
these two days.

372
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,040
Okay.

373
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm leaving. Pay the bill.

374
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,410
No. Wait.

375
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,850
You're buying me a meal.

376
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,760
You didn't eat anything

377
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,890
and you want me to pay for it?

378
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm buying you a meal,
but you're paying for it.

379
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,520
It's just right. Is there a problem?

380
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:30,930
He Ran,

381
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,760
be a human, okay?

382
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,240
I'm not a human.

383
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,610
Why do you have an ID
if you're not a human?

384
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,240
Even a dog has its ID.

385
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,850
That's for a dog.

386
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,140
(Medicine)

387
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,100
(Open)

388
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,130
Hello.

389
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,890
I'd like to check my body temperature.

390
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,480
Okay.

391
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,170
Thank you.

392
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,410
Can you give me an antipyretic?

393
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,480
Okay, hold on.

394
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,690
Here you go.

395
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,210
(Antipyretic)

396
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,520
(Antipyretic)
Can you give me a glass of water?

397
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,780
(Antipyretic)

398
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,520
- Here.
- Thank you.

399
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,140
(Qin Zao)

400
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,250
Let's meet up.

401
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,370
The same restaurant.

402
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,450
One million.

403
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,410
The password is 034923.

404
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,600
Take it.

405
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:38,890
What do you mean?

406
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,560
Nothing.

407
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,410
Take the money and leave Qiongzhou.

408
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,930
Never look for Xiao Han anymore.

409
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,200
You know

410
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,250
Xiao Han has been living a poor life.

411
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,970
He can't give you much money.

412
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,040
Where did you get so much money?

413
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,680
This is your money. I can't take it.

414
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,930
You don't have to know
where I got the money.

415
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,970
If you really need money

416
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,520
and you looked for Xiao Han
because you're scared,

417
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,000
you should take the money

418
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,120
and leave this place.

419
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,450
Otherwise,

420
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,450
I doubt what you said is true.

421
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,410
Do you understand?

422
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,290
Can you give me a few days
to think about it?

423
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,290
Sure. Is three days enough?

424
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes.

425
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,600
Okay.

426
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
Little sis.

427
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,560
Thank you.

428
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:35,770
No need.

429
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,290
