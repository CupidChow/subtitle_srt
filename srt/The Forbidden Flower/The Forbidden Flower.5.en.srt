(Barber)

4
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,100
Hi.

5
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,020
Anything?

6
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,620
Something has really happened this time.

7
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,140
Father.

8
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,220
Father?

9
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,540
You...

10
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,460
You have a child?

11
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,340
He's my father.

12
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,580
I told you

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,380
not to call me this outside.

14
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,340
So,

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,780
she's not your child?

16
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
She's my elder brother's child.

17
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,300
Why is she calling you father?

18
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,660
Can you be my father?

19
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,180
Can't you be my father?

20
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,020
Why don't

21
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,700
we talk in the house?

22
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
I have some nice food.

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,740
We can talk and eat at the same time.

24
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,420
How did you get to know her?

25
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,660
I was in the supermarket buying...

26
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,620
Actually, it's nothing.

27
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,820
I was buying something
in the supermarket

28
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,220
and I bumped into her.

29
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,740
The painting fell out.

30
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,420
Then

31
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,980
I brought her back here.

32
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,180
I'll go get something.

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,020
Child, eat an apple.

34
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,820
Don't call me child.

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,620
You're a child.

36
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,700
You're a child.

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,820
I'm a child,

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,420
but you shouldn't call me child.

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,700
Was the guy in the supermarket

40
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,740
your boyfriend?

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,540
I can tell something is wrong
with you two.

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,700
He's not my boyfriend.

43
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,940
Why were you feeling nervous?

44
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,580
Weren't you feeling nervous, too?

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,100
After all, you were lying.

46
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,020
Fine.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,380
When your uncle comes back,

48
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,900
I'll tell him the truth.

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,500
After all, I can explain myself.

50
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,260
As for you,

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,420
I'm not sure.

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,940
When I have money,

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,740
I'll pay you back the money
for the painting materials.

54
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,540
Are you saying that we shouldn't mention

55
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,300
anything that has happened?

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,260
Liar, bad woman,

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,020
troublemaker!

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,900
Quanquan.

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,140
Listen to me.

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Stealing is bad.

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,620
You can't take something
that's not yours.

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,540
I can ask your uncle to

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,020
send you to my studio.

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,180
I can teach you for free

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,860
and give you brand new
painting materials.

66
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,900
How does that sound?

67
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,740
In my hometown,

68
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,820
I normally get the good first

69
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,140
and my grandmother
would pay for it later.

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,580
I thought it works the same here.

71
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,020
I know I was wrong.

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,340
I won't do it again.

73
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,300
Can you teach me painting?

74
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,860
It depends on whether you trust

75
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,700
the liar or not.

76
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,980
I wanted to ask him

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,020
to thank you personally.

78
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,180
I didn't expect he ran away

79
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,180
just like that.

80
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,820
You're being too kind.

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,980
You insisted on giving me money
in the hospital.

82
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,980
Now, you've giving me a job.
I should thank you instead.

83
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,780
You mentioned a friend just now.

84
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,460
What? The drink is too hot?

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,660
It's nice.

86
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,860
What's going on with your friend?

87
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,380
Is he a great horticulturist?

88
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,340
Yes.

89
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,300
Let him handle your garden.

90
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,980
He'll do a great job.

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,700
What's your friend's name?

92
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,940
Xiao Han.

93
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,580
You're back.

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

95
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,460
Wash your hands and eat.

96
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,020
Are you busy lately?

97
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,060
Yes.

98
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,740
You're busy? Great.

99
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,180
When you're working in the daytime,

100
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,460
I'll take care of Quanquan for you.

101
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,060
Let her come to our studio.

102
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,300
I'll teach her painting.

103
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,300
When you get off work...

104
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,300
No need.

105
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,140
I'll send Quanquan back
to hometown tomorrow.

106
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,420
Quanquan.

107
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,780
Don't listen to him.

108
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,980
Just eat.

109
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,060
Let me check him out.

110
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,100
You're not eating?

111
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,140
I'm waiting for you.

112
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,940
I'm still working.

113
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,140
It's okay.

114
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,020
I'm not hungry.

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,980
Let me stay here with you.

116
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,020
There are mosquitoes in the greenhouse.
You'll get bitten

117
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
wearing like this.

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,900
What should I do?

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,220
Change into your pants.

120
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,980
I didn't bring any pants.

121
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,260
Why don't

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,460
you help me get

123
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,900
some mosquito repellent?

124
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,100
What flower is this with the big leaves?

125
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,580
Epiphyllum.

126
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,660
So, this is epiphyllum.

127
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
The legendary

128
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,300
flower that only blossoms for a second.

129
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,420
Epiphyllum hardly blossoms.

130
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
Has it blossomed before?

131
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,380
No.

132
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
Why?

133
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,340
I guess it's not time yet.

134
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,380
You...

135
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,020
There's a mosquito.

136
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,420
It's flown away.

137
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,140
It's on your leg.

138
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,740
What's it?

139
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,620
A mosquito.

140
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,460
What's wrong with you?

141
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,140
I was bitten by the mosquito

142
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,900
and you didn't kill it for me.

143
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,860
It stopped on you. I can't kill it.

144
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,740
I think you did in on purpose.

145
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,540
Are you okay?

146
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,580
I'm okay.

147
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,100
Is your hand okay?

148
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,620
- I'm sorry.
- Don't play a fool here.

149
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,540
I didn't mean to fall down.

I did it on purpose this time.

Is your hand okay?

162
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,740
Sit down there.

163
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,660
Why did you go to the kitchen?

164
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm thirsty. I was getting
some water in the kitchen.

165
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,660
The water dispenser is
in the living room.

166
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,420
I wanted to get a bowl to get the water.

167
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,860
There's paper cup on
the water dispenser.

168
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Didn't you see it?

169
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,620
I didn't.

170
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,900
Are you blind?

171
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,940
All right.

172
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,780
It's getting late. Go home first.

173
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,500
You're already chasing me away?

174
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,260
Uncle, I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

175
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
No, I...

176
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,620
Look at how bad my legs are bitten.

177
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,220
I can't handle this in the studio.

178
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,860
Do you have

179
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,220
green balm for me?

180
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,580
It's at the second floor.

181
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll got get it in the bedroom.

182
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,220
I'll go. I'll get it for you.

183
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Why

184
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,900
is the mosquito

185
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,620
not biting you?

186
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,980
It only bites me alone?

187
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,980
Maybe it prefers

188
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,020
people that're not pure.

189
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,860
Which one

190
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,700
are you talking about?

191
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,620
Is it the mosquito or you?

192
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,700
The mosquito.

193
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,460
What about you?

194
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,020
I didn't bite you.

195
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm asking you.

196
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,820
Do you like people that're not pure?

197
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,020

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,260
I'm used to living alone.

234
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,340
I don't eat on time. I'm afraid I...

235
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,540
Can I stay a few days longer?

236
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,540
Go to bed now.

237
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,940
I'm not a picky eater.

238
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,060
I can eat instant noodles
if you don't cook.

239
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,580
I'll be nice.

240
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,820
Tell me if you don't like anything.

241
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,380
I promise I won't do it.

242
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,060
Send me back only

243
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,740
when the school reopens,

244
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,580
okay?

245
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,660
Actually, when you see this painting,

246
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,820
you may ask me,

247
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,460
is there such a flower

248
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,020
in the world?

249
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,260
Actually, there's none.

250
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,780
All right, you can

251
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,300
write down the flower
that you want to paint.

252
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,340
We'll talk about it later.

253
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,180
Okay, Ms. He.

254
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,020
Good morning.

255
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,940
That day, you told me that

256
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,540
I can send Quanquan to the studio

257
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,180
and you'll take care of her,
does that still count?

258
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,380
Of course.

259
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,300
I happen to have something on
these few days.

260
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
Please take care of her.

261
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,220
Come on.

262
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,940
Look. They're my students.

263
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,980
Isn't it great?

264
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,300
Okay, it's recess time.

265
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
Go have fun.

266
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,180
- Thank you, Ms. He.
- Thank you, Ms. He.

267
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
What do you think

268
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,220
about the paintings?

269
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,620
It's great.

270
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,180
Really?

271
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,220
I painted all these.

272
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,140
It's not good then.

273
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,380
What a shame.

274
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,700
Why?

275
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,220
I wanted to teach you myself.

276
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,580
But since you don't like that,

277
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
then I can't.

278
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,860
You're willing to teach me?

279
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,380
It depends on my mood.

280
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,100
You can say something nice

281
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,100
to make me happy.

282
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm not saying it.

283
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,820
You're stubborn.

284
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,180
You like painting flowers?

285
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,100
Yes.

286
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,740
My uncle likes flowers.

287
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,700
Is that the reason why you like him?

288
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,980
Reason?

289
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,300
I just like him.

290
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I like him as how he is.

291
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,660
You won't understand.

292
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,020
Let's go.

293
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,180
I'll show you over there

294
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,940
the new painting materials
and painting frame.

295
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,420
You must thank me for that.

296
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,900
Let me do it. Take a rest.

297
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,420
You're Xiao Han?

298
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,820
I brought water. It's there.

299
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,980
You can drink it.

300
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,300
Okay.

301
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,700
Thank you.

302
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,740
Why are you here?

303
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,020
What?

304
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,860
What are you talking about?
Why can't I come here?

305
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,860
Where's He Ran?

306
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,340
She's sleeping.

307
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,260
I'll look for her upstairs.

308
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,620
No.

309
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,860
Wait!

310
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,380
Yu!

311
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,780
Slow down.

312
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,980
Wait.

313
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,620
What?

314
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,340
Well...

315
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Ran

316
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
is not feeling well today.

317
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,060
She's sleeping after
taking the medicine.

318
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Why don't you come again another day?

319
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,500
She's not feeling well?

320
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,820
What's going on?

321
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,140
Is she having anemia again?

322
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,100
No.

323
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,980
She's caught a cold.
She just needs some rest.

324
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,660
Okay.

325
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,340
I'll look for her upstairs.

326
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
What now?

327
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,940
Well, this is the best timing.

328
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,140
You're here just in time.

329
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,140
Well, Yu.

330
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,220
The light in the kitchen is damaged.

331
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Ran and I are not tall enough
to reach it.

332
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,380
I'm getting ready to go out

333
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
and get someone to fix it.

334
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,180
And you're here.

335
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,180
That's great.

336
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,940
Why don't

337
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,180
you help us fix it?

338
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,220
I think

339
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
you're tall enough to reach it.

340
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,180
Are you joking? I'm 1.85m tall.

341
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,460
Really?

342
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,940
You're really tall.

343
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,940
You're also very handsome.

344
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,980
That's great.

345
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,820
Not too bad.

346
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,820
That's the light.

347
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,300
No problem. Leave it to me.

348
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,260
Do you need a stool?

349
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,740
Are you joking?

350
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,660
Do I even need a stool?

351
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,420
You're right.

352
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,260
Give me a stool.

353
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,140
Here you go, Yu.

354
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,620
Well, Yu,

355
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,740
go ahead.

356
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,140
I'll go get you a glass of water.

357
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,940
Sure.

358
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,100
(Ran, come home quickly.)

359
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,300
(Han Yu is here.)

360
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,740
Help me take care of her. Thank you.

361
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,820
Where are you going?

362
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,700
♪O mio babbino caro♪

363
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:43,020
♪Mi piace, è bello bello♪

364
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,540
It's so tiring.

365
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,660
How did it go?

366
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,780
It's so easy.

367
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,220
You're good.

368
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,340
Here. Drink some water.

369
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
That's why I said

370
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,580
Yu is the best.

371
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,740
Thank you so much.

372
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,620
No problem.

373
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,140
I almost forgot.
I need to look for He Ran.

374
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,140
Yu, well...

375
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Have you taken

376
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,380
lunch?

377
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,580
I haven't. What's the matter?

378
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,940
Look here.

379
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
I've made some buns.

380
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,580
It's freshly baked. Give it a try.

381
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
No, I'm on a diet.

382
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
You're so skinny.

383
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,540
Why do you need to lose weight?

384
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,340
No.

385
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,660
Come on. Don't be shy.

386
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,220
Have a taste.

387
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,220
You're also very handsome.

388
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,500
That's great.

389
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,500
Yu is the best.

390
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
You're so skinny.

391
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,260
Why do you need to lose weight?

392
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,100
Well, I need to check on He Ran.

393
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,100
Let go.

394
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,780
Hey, you should

395
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,980
watch your manner.

396
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,540
We should keep a distance.

397
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,660
Hold on.

398
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,300
What's wrong with her?

399
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,700
How did you handle the rubbish?

400
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,220
Why did you throw it in my yard?

401
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,580
The night willow herb
that I've just planted

402
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,580
is all dead now.

403
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,020
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,380
We were not being careful

405
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,580
when we threw the rubbish.

406
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,860
Not being careful?

407
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,460
That's all you can say?

408
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,860
What about my night willow herb?

409
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
The flower has withered.
If the owner was asking for it,

410
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,220
who would take the responsibility?

411
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,060
I will.

412
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,300
What herb is dead?

413
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,060
I will take the responsibility.
Tell me about it.

414
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,140
Who are you?

415
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,940
I'm the...

416
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,020
No.

417
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,220
I

418
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,020
am the host of this house.

419
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,900
Tell me if there's anything.
Don't shout here.

420
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,220
Do you know you're so noisy
that others can't sleep?

421
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,780
You simply threw rubbish everywhere
and I'm shouting here?

422
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,580
Why am I shouting here?
How am I shouting here

423
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,500
Stop shouting.

424
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,100
It's just rubbish, right?

425
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,420
Stop shouting.

426
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,020
Let me tell you.

427
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,060
I'll give you a lesson today.

428
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,020
No.

429
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,100
Let's talk nicely.

430
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,780
Stop talking nonsense to me.

431
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
You can't hit me.

432
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,380
Let me tell you.

433
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,660
You can't hit me.

434
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,300
You must not act recklessly, young man.

435
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,180
What?

436
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,300
Don't be angry.

437
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,540
Look. Let me tell you.

438
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,100
Look. Let me tell you.

439
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
You can't hit me.

440
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,940
You're young. So, you don't know.

441
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,060
I'll hit you!

442
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,500
Why did you hit

443
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,780
me?

444
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,500
Ma'am.

445
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
You're finally back home.

446
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,900
Did Han Yu find out that I was not home?

447
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,220
No, I've been stalling him.

448
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,060
Okay, thank you.

449
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,380
- I'll go up now.
- Go ahead.

450
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,060
Han Yu, why are you here?

451
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,180
What happened to your face?
Did someone hit you?

452
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,500
I fell down accidentally.

453
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,460
You're not a child anymore.

454
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,500
Be careful when you walk next time.

455
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,100
No.

456
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,900
You...

457
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,300
You were sleeping.

458
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,100
You didn't know that

459
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,620
someone was here to make a scene.

460
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,300
Who was that?

461
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,540
A man from next door.

462
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,380
I don't know who he is.

463
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
He was shouting downstairs

464
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,180
and he didn't want to stop.

465
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,460
But, no worries.

466
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,900
I've kept him under control.

467
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,980
I took him out with only one arm.

468
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,660
I've kept him under control

469
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,860
totally.

470
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,260
And you were hit by him?

471
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,380
No, I...

472
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,180
I said that I fell down.

473
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,140
Well, the thing is,

474
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,900
I wanted to see you

475
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,500
so badly that

476
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,660
I didn't watch where I was going.

477
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,140
That's

478
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,180
your response?

479
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,900
I got hurt because

480
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,060
I was trying to protect your home.

481
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,180
Shouldn't you...

482
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,700
Shouldn't you

483
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,740
apply some medicine for me

484
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,820
and check the wound?

485
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,580
Ma'am,

486
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,420
apply some medicine for him.

487
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,500
Coming.

488
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,340
No need to trouble her.

489
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,060
I mean it.

490
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,900
Come on. Let me help you.

491
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,340
Don't get infected.

492
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
It's not good to have a scar.

493
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,860
Your skin is all scratched.

494
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,740
Hold on. Stop.

495
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,900
You...

496
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
Don't move.

497
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,620
It just occurs to me that...

498
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,620
I'm leaving now.

499
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,980
No, clean your wound first.

500
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,780
He's leaving.

501
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,940
Thank you for your help today.

502
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:24,940
No problem.

503
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,300
Luckily you came home in time.

504
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,140
The gentleman next door
was helping us, too.

505
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,380
I asked him to help.

506
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,020
Thank him for me.

507
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,220
Sure.

508
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,660
Go up and take a rest.

509
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,820
I'll call you when the meal is ready.

510
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,580
Okay.

511
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,940
Why is there someone else?

512
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,940
Usually

513
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,100
he'd only allow others
to take the soil and water for him.

514
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,500
Why would he allow others to
handle the garden?

515
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,300
They're having fun.

516
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,460
No wonder he won't allow me
to go to his garden.

517
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,020
I want to see how this guy looks.

518
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,140
Aunt.

519
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,300
I'm at home.

520
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,500
The restaurant in Xiaozhou Village?

521
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,820
Okay.

522
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,060
I'll be there.

523
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,140
Okay. Bye.

524
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,340
Ms. He, bye.

525
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,820
Bye.

526
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,820
Something happened to me today,

527
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,060
I'm not going to teach you painting.

528
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,460
You looked for your boyfriend,
didn't you?

529
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,420
I've told you many times.

530
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,580
He's not my boyfriend.

531
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,540
I don't believe you.

532
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,420
It's up to you.

533
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,460
Let's go. Pack your stuff.

534
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,500
Ms. He, someone is looking
for you outside.

535
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,700
Okay, thank you.

536
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,580
It must be your boyfriend.

537
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,580
It could be.

538
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,660
See?

539
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,300
I was right.

540
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,100
Are you here to pick up Quanquan?

541
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,580
Buy us dinner.

542
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,700
The man in the supermarket!

543
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,060
He Ran, it's your boyfriend!

544
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,780
Quan.

545
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,380
Quanquan.

546
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,460
You can't talk like that.

547
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,860
My student in the studio

548
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,140
has just sent me a WeChat message

549
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,380
saying that she left her keys there.

550
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,380
I need to go back and get it for her.

551
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,260
We're not eating dinner
together tonight.

552
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,260
Well,

553
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,900
I'm a member

554
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,180
of this cafe.

555
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,700
Bring Quanquan there for coffee

556
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,700
and accumulate some points for me

557
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,220
to redeem a children's gift.

558
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,180
See you at the studio tomorrow.

559
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,260
Wait.

560
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,340
What are you doing?

561
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,700
Why are you here in Xiaozhou Village?

562
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,740
It's because of my uncle.

563
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,780
I wonder why he's behaving
strangely lately.

564
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,900
He stays in his garden

565
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,180
for his plants.

566
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,620
My aunt asked me to come

567
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,620
and manage the restaurant.

568
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,020
Actually, it's nothing.

569
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,900
Don't hang out here. Go home early then.

570
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,540
No, wait.

571
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,500
What do you by "hang out"?

572
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,900
Forget about me. Let's talk about you.

573
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Why do you come to
Xiaozhou Village every day?

574
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,740
Didn't the caretaker

575
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,020
monitor you closely?

576
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,940
Speaking of

577
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,900
your caretaker,

578
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,500
she...

579
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,700
She's abnormal. Let me advise you.

580
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,060
Why is she abnormal?

581
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,980
Her

582
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,660
behaviour

583
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,540
is out of the boundary.

584
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,660
Did you find out anything?

585
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,460
Let me tell you.

586
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,820
Let's stay out

587
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,340
of her business.

588
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,940
I'm serious.

589
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,380
When I was looking for you
at your place in the afternoon,

590
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,580
she didn't allow me to go in

591
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,540
and she also

592
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,300
praised me.

593
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,300
She said that I'm skinny and excellent.

594
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,220
She even said that I have a good temper

595
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,220
and I'm helpful.

596
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,020
She said I've done her a huge favour.

597
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,700
It's disgusting.

598
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,860
No.

599
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,380
No.

600
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,820
Isn't that the little girl
in the supermarket?

601
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,700
She came here with you?

602
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,740
No, she came...

603
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,820
She came here with her relative.
Stop looking.

604
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,980
That's your friend?

605
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,060
Yes.

606
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,020
The guy next to him?

607
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,940
That's your friend?

608
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,260
Yes, he's my friend.

609
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,460
You really have a wide range of friends,

610
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
even friends of this age.

611
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,220
It's none of your business.

612
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,780
Well, it's none of my business.

613
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
But,

614
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,780
what's wrong with you?

615
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,980
Your mother

616
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,900
allows you to come out alone?

617
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,220
I...

618
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,540
I came here with my mother today.

619
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,500
She is here?

620
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,100
Where is she?

621
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,300
She's doing something
and she'll pick me up later.

622
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,900
I see.

623
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,700
Then...

624
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,820
Have fun. I'm leaving.

625
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,340
What fun am I having?

626
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,820

Okay, start painting.

Are you not going to teach me?

631
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,740
I can't help it.

632
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,140
You didn't keep your word.

633
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,540
You didn't keep your word either.

634
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,980
That's the result
after you've betrayed someone.

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,580
I didn't notice. What's wrong?

640
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,460
It's okay. Carry on with the painting.

641
