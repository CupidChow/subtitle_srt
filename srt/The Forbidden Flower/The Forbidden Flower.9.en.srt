=Episode 9=

3
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
He Ran's caretaker

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,730
is here,

5
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,200
at my doorstep. What should I do?

6
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,450
What?

7
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,400
What is she doing?

8
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,810
Hold on. Let me take a look.

9
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,680
Let me take a picture for you.

10
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,400
She looks quite anxious.

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
What should I do?

12
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,280
Help me, just think!

13
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,480
No, I definitely won't see her.

14
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,370
I had our maid tell her

15
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,400
I wasn't home

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,730
and neither was my whole family.

17
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,170
Besides,

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,680
my aunt and uncle are both abroad.

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,650
They are definitely not at home.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,450
I'll hang up now.

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,810
I need to hide.

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,050
Xiao Han.

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,330
Yes?

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,330
Here. Carry this for me.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,930
Come on.

26
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,060
I'm exhausted.

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,680
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)
I'm exhausted.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,650
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)
I carried it all the way

29
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,810
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)
from Flower, bird and fish Market.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,560
Also,

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
help me see

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,810
if it's okay.

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,720
Why isn't it moving much?

34
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,400
It's probably drying out
due to the heat.

35
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,930
I'll change the water.

36
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,530
Xiao Han.

37
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,370
Let's give this fish a name.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's call it Ran

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
or Ranran.

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,600
Isn't your cat's name Zaozao?

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,400
Both are reduplicative words.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,120
But you have to keep an eye on your cat.

43
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,680
Keep it away from the fish.

44
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,600
Don't name animals so easily.

45
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,330
Once it has a name,

46
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,490
they'll behave differently.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,050
With a name, comes an attachment.

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
Then why does your cat have a name?

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
It's not my cat.

50
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,930
But it's your fish now.

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,770
Okay.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,970
I'll pick it up later.

53
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,560
It's a long journey.

54
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,930
I think I'll stay overnight.

55
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,120
It's okay. I'll do my best.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,930
Bye.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,840
Are you going out tomorrow?

58
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,680
I'll run some errands
in the countryside.

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,810
Take me with you.

60
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,600
Okay?

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,250
No.

62
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,970
Why?

63
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,530
You rejected me at the drop of a hat.

64
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,650
You are very demanding.

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,650
I've grown accustomed

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,050
to rejecting it.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,650
I'll give you some time

68
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,650
to think about it.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,560
- Okay?
- No.

70
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,330
As I said, you are so demanding.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,810
I can't think of

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
any more reasons to say no to you.

73
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,330
No means no.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,480
Yu.

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:24,800
Yu.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,570
Was Ran really

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,090
not with you these two days?

78
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,770
Hands off.

79
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,210
What are you doing here

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
in broad daylight?

81
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,840
Stop it. This is my home.

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,130
We have Tibetan mastiffs.

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,770
Let go.

84
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,010
Sorry.

85
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,650
I was so anxious

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,130
that I pulled your hand.

87
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,450
Was Ran really never here?

88
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,280
Yes.

89
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,240
Listen.

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,160
I don't know anything about her.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
We're obviously not close now.

92
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,130
I have to go.

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,240
Wait.

94
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,890
Listen.

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,720
Don't you ever loiter
in front of my house again.

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,570
It's not good if people

97
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,280
see you like this.

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,480
It'll also ruin my reputation.

99
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,890
Wait, Yu.

100
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,360
Xiao Ran is...

101
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,010
Did you know that Ran

102
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,450
has recently made
a new friend out there?

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,890
Do you have the address?

104
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,690
Why don't you tell me
and I'll go find it myself?

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,280
Then I won't have to bother you anymore.

106
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,400
Hands off.

107
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,240
Listen.

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
I don't know.

109
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,650
I don't know anything about her.

110
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,970
No way.

111
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,400
Yu.

112
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,040
Think again.

113
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,330
Where on earth is Ran?

114
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,570
Fatty.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,890
What are you doing?

116
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm unloading the truck.

117
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,840
What can I do for you?

118
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Xiao Han asked me to come
and get the car keys for him.

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,570
Yes, he told me.

120
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,130
Why did you come instead of him?

121
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,010
He was busy.
So he asked me to come and get it.

122
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,010
I see.

123
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,970
Tell him

124
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,400
I've filled up the tank.

125
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,480
You know what? Xiao's truck

126
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,280
may be rusty and shabby,

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
but it's a great loader.

128
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,330
That's all it is good for.

129
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,160
Your child has run away

130
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,650
and you need to get her back.

131
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,890
(Your "child" has run away)
Of course, you can choose

132
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,600
(Your "child" has run away)
not to look for her.

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,460
(Your "child" has run away)

134
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,840
But she took your car keys.

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
If you can't find her,

136
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,570
you won't be able to
go to the countryside.

137
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,460
(Haircutting, perming and colouring)

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,800
Here's a little tip

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,090
to help you find her.

140
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,940
Do you still remember the place

141
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,530

I'll put this here.

148
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,010
Xiao Han, long time no see.

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,010
By the way, some time ago

150
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,240
a girl came here looking for you.

151
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,970
I asked her to go to Xiaozhou Village.

152
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,160
Did she find you later?

153
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,090
Yes.

154
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,040
I knew it.

155
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,210
She didn't even know
your name at the time.

156
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,570
But I could tell by

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,770
the look on her face

158
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,210
that the man she was looking for

159
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,820
was definitely you.

160
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,360
(Second encounter. She dropped a thing.)
was definitely you.

161

337
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,280
play with the dog. I'll get going.

338
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,240
The dog?

339
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,800
Xiao Han.

340
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,720
Why aren't any of

341
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,080
the flowers you bought blooming?

342
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,760
It is not the right season yet.

343
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,170
Then why do you buy them?

344
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,170
I don't even know
what kind of flower it is

345
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,080
or what it looks like.

346
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,850
You will know.

347
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,000
What is this place?

348
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,850
Why are there so many surfboards?

349
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,370
It's a surfboard shop
that Fatty used to run,

350
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,720
He closed it down when business got bad.

351
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,720
These surfboards didn't sell.

352
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,970
So

353
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,370
they're just sitting here as decoration.

354
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,800
But these surfboards are so pretty.

355
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,850
Why didn't they sell?

356
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,690
There are a lot of these
equipment stores near the beach.

357
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,690
The competition is fierce.

358
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,560
Fatty said he didn't know much

359
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,890
about this area either.

360
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,690
He was just following the trend

361
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,370
and wanted to make money when
he saw people opening businesses.

362
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,210
Then, within a few months,
it ended up closing down.

363
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,370
So he went to Xiaozhou Village

364
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,130
and opened that restaurant, right?

365
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,690
Later?

366
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,930
Later,

367
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,520
he ran an auto repair shop,

368
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,720
worked in the seafood business

369
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,080
and contracted construction jobs.

370
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,760
He has engaged in many small businesses.

371
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,650
The restaurant in Xiaozhou Village

372
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,800
was run by his wife for him.

373
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,850
By the way,

374
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,040
I've booked a room for you
in a homestay next door.

375
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
You'll sleep there at night.

376
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,280
We'll leave

377
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
when we get the flowers tomorrow.

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,170
I will sleep here tonight.

379
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
Xiao Han.

380
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
This is the first time

381
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
you've shared that much with me.

382
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,450
I used to

383
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,480
hear all your stories

384
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,370
and gossip from others.

385
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,930
So you can talk about
such daily things, too.

386
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,610
I'm just an ordinary person.

387
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,040
I think you are very mysterious.

388
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,610
That's because you're
too far away from my life.

389
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,210
Do you want to take a shower first?

390
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,930
No.

391
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,690
You look so dusty. You go first.

392
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Rest here for a while.

393
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,280
I'm done.

394
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,650
Do you want to shower here
or at the homestay?

395
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,450
I kind of like it here.

396
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,610
I'll take a shower here.

397
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

398
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,760
You have a nice body.

399
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,970
Go and take a shower.

400
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,610
Xiao Han.

401
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,720
I put a bottle of beer for you here.

402
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,850
Remember to drink it.

403
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,690
Drink it within
30 seconds for best taste.

404
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,210
30,

405
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,560
29,

406
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,610
28,

407
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,520
27,

408
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,240
26,

409
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,760
25,

410
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,370
24,

411
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,480
23,

412
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,000
22,

413
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,650
21.

414
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,000
He Ran.

415
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,930
What does this stone look like to you?

416
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,210
I find that

417
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,480
my stone and your stone together

418
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,170
look like a heart shape.

419
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,610
However,

420
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,210
this seems longer.

421
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,000
This is good enough.
Doesn't it look like it?

422
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Yes.

423
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,210
You're always right.

424
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,320
Look at them.

425
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,650
So childish.

426
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,760
Aren't they sound corny?

427
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,970
Listen. They're the childish ones,

428
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,000
not me, okay?

429
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,240
Xiao Han, what are they looking at?

430
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,930
Come here.

431
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,890
Let's go. He's called us.

432
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,480
Come on. Let's play together.

433
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,130
What is this?

434
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,610
Don't touch it.

435
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,930
I just want to touch it.

436
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
It's so pretty.

437
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,080
Why can't I touch it?

438
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,760
Pretty things are usually dangerous.

439
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,450
So you're saying that

440
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
good-looking women are dangerous too?

441
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,210
Jellyfish aren't women.

442
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,610
Jellyfish are called Shuimu.
[*Referred to Sea Goddess]

443
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,720
Why aren't they female?

444
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,650
Jellyfish aren't male either.

445
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Some jellyfish are hermaphroditic.

446
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,850
What other creatures

447
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,170
besides jellyfish are hermaphroditic?

448
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,280
Sea flatworms.

449
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,240
What are sea flatworms?

450
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,610
So they are also

451
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,080
pretty creatures.

452
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,760
Yes, also poisonous.

453
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:48,650
Sea flatworms

454
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
fight to decide

455
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,850
who will be the father
and who will be the mother.

456
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Is that so?

457
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,080
Most sea flatworms

458
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,210
don't want to take on the role of mother

459
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,040
because the mother uses

460
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,560
many times the energy of the father.

461
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,850
So they have to feed constantly

462
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,800
to keep their energy pumping.

463
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,410
Unlike the father,

464
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,690
it can

465
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
roam freely

466
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,280
once it's finished mating.

467
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,280
Such a scumbag.

468
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,450
You can say so.

469
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,210
So how do they fight?

470
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,970
Check it online.

471
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,450
Rest early.

472
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,320
We have to leave early tomorrow morning.

473
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,610
You're so behaved today.

474
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,720
I've been so well-behaved today.

475
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,930
Can you give me a reward?

476
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,240
You just won't stop, do you?

477
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,080
Go back and rest.

478
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,280
What's wrong?

479
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,800
Missing me so soon?

480
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
You forgot your bag.

481
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,210
See you.

482
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:54,860
(How sea flatworms fight?)

483
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,690
Xiao Han.

484
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,040
You knew I was coming over.

485
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,690
How did you know?

486
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,280
How can you know everything?

487
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,410
Is there anything you don't know?

488
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,560
Are you hungry?

489
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,560
I'll take you out for a snack.

490
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm not hungry.
I ate a lot during dinner.

491
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,690
What would you like to drink?

492
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,080
No, thanks.

493
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,370
Xiao Han.

494
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,720
How come all you do
is eat and drink every day?

495
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,890
Are you raising a pig?

496
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,720
Can you have some fun?

497
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,850
Fun.

498
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,370
What are you

499
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,000
trying to do again?

500
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,520
I want to go upstairs to see the stars.

501
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,240
It's cloudy today. There are no stars.

502
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
Just take me upstairs.

503
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,610
I want to see the stars.

504
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,080
Xiao Han.

505
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,450
Let's share it.

506
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,450
Actually,
