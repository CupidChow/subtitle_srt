1
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,513
I'm sorry it's heavily damaged.

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,898
-Hello.
-Please come in.

3
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,870
Would it be possible to fix this?

4
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,801
Wow, this is really old.

5
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,882
And bring Si-heon back to life,
no matter what.

6
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,457
When the lights outside the window

7
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,171
Start dimming one by one

8
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,134
I write a letter to the sky

9
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,182
You left me for someone else

10
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,768
But I still cannot forget you

11
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,147
So I gather my tears…

12
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,475
Hey, Han Jun-hee. I have orange and grape.

13
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,392
Pick one.

14
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,898
Hey, what's up with you?

15
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,402
Han Jun-hee.

16
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,537
Hey, is something wrong?

17
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,873
Just for a moment.

18
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,502
Just stay like this for a moment.

19
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,131
A TIME CALLED YOU

20
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,376
Thanks for bringing me home.

21
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,676
Jun-hee.

22
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,275
Why were you like that
at my house earlier?

23
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,069
Did something happen?

24
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,612
Well…

25
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,828
I went back to 2023 for a bit.

26
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,705
What?

27
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,749
It was only for a short while.

28
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,959
But I missed you so much there.

29
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,880
As soon as I saw you,
my emotions took over, and I teared up.

30
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,091
Strange, isn't it?

31
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,012
Are you sure nothing happened to you?

32
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,308
No, it's nothing like that.

33
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,064
All right. Go in and get some rest.

34
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,193
Starting tomorrow,
I'll pick you up in the mornings.

35
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,322
Your attacker is still on the loose.

36
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,325
There's Byeon Da-hyeon's case now too.
It worries me.

37
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,536
Let's go to school together for now.

38
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,374
Okay?

39
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,085
Sure.

40
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,295
Go on inside.

41
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,547
Min-ju.

42
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,801
Hey, Min-ju. Kwon Min-ju!
Kwon Min-ju, can't you hear me?

43
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,097
Min-ju.

44
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,849
Hey, Min-ju!

45
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,268
Kwon Min-ju!

46
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,358
Hey, Min-ju.

47
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,779
Where on earth am I?

48
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,831
Just stay like this for a moment.

49
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,251
I just need you
to stay like this for a moment.

50
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,647
Nam Si-heon, go faster.

51
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,359
Let's go!

52
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,424
Do-hun, you need to get up now.

53
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,467
Just five more minutes.

54
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,979
What five minutes?
Get up right now, Kwon Do-hun.

55
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,484
Get ready for school now,
or there'll be no breakfast.

56
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,236
Okay.

57
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,780
That temper of yours, honestly.

58
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,753
If you're not good at StarCraft,
you become a loner, you know?

59
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,005
Try it. You'll be hooked too.

60
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,634
Aren't you going to school?

61
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,344
Huh? Give me a second.

62
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,065
-You're already out.
-Yeah.

63
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,399
Get on.

64
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,198
If Mom finds out

65
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,369
your boyfriend is taking you to school,
you'll be in big trouble.

66
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,453
Should I tell her?

67
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,330
Hey, Kwon Do-hun. Don't you dare.

68
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,415
He's your younger brother, right?

69
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,043
Keep it a secret, and I'll reward you.

70
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,420
In that case,
I won't say anything for now.

71
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,340
You're giving my sister a ride,
so no speeding.

72
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,258
Yes, sir.

73
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,218
Get going!

74
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,807
Gosh.

75
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,101
She's all grown up now.

76
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,077
Hey.

77
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,087
-Did you two come together?
-Yeah.

78
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,674
I was worried, so I'm giving her a ride
until her attacker is caught.

79
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,343
Good idea. I was a bit anxious too.

80
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,472
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

81
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,692
Hi, Min-ju.

82
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,611
Huh? Oh, hi.

83
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,368
Morning, Kwon Min-ju.

84
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,078
Hi.

85
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,538
-Kwon Min-ju.
-Yes?

86
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,081
I've been waiting for you.

87
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,253
Why? Did something happen?

88
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,591
It's about Da-hyeon's death.

89
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,053
On my way here, I saw the police
talking to Yong-seon and Ji-hui

90
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,387
in the counseling office.

91
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,264
Well,

92
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,644
those two were really close
to Byeon Da-hyeon.

93
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,396
But I overheard them mention your name.

94
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,070
My name?

95
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,447
Yeah, I definitely heard them
talking about you.

96
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,160
Is everything okay?

97
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,550
Kwon Min-ju.

98
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,637
Come to the counseling office
for a moment.

99
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,558
Okay.

100
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,363
I asked you to come
because I have a few questions.

101
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,199
Okay.

102
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,663
Do you know anything
about what happened to Byeon Da-hyeon?

103
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,083
No, I don't.

104
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,377
Are you sure?

105
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,379
Yes.

106
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,300
Apparently, Da-hyeon and her friends

107
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,679
secretly took photos
of you getting changed

108
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,556
and put them up in the classroom.

109
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,807
What about that?

110
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
I've never heard about it.

111
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,567
The night before Da-hyeon was killed,

112
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,862
she came here to put up
those photos she'd secretly taken.

113
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,282
But when Da-hyeon's body was found
the next morning,

114
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,451
not a single one
was on the classroom wall.

115
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,703
You don't know anything about that?

116
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,623
Well,

117
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,753
I don't know anything.

118
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,464
Sorry.

119
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,427
Okay. That's all, then.

120
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,846
You're free to go.

121
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,059
Is that it?

122
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,519
Yeah.

123
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,940
Go get ready for class.

124
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,069
Yes, sir.

125
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,656
Goodbye.

126
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,286
COUNSELING OFFICE

127
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,298
Min-ju.

128
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,807
Is something wrong?

129
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,600
Sorry?

130
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,437
You're so different from when you came
to the police station about In-gyu.

131
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,109
You were articulate and calm then.
You're totally different today.

132
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,820
Are you okay?

133
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,990
Yes, I'm fine.

134
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,622
Feel free to tell me if something's wrong.

135
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,293
Thank you for looking out for me.

136
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,462
But I'm fine, really.

137
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,093
Okay. Off you go, then.

138
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,679
Thank you.

139
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,466
I practiced countless times,

140
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,468
but I almost got caught.

141
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,347
I need to practice more.

142
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,318
Don't you agree?

143
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,487
Han Jun-hee.

144
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,408
What? Were you listening to me?

145
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,870
Did you know I was here?

146
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,580
Yeah.

147
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,999
I already knew.

148
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,835
I

149
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,756
was stuck in the room you're in now,

150
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,010
practicing countless times to be like you.

151
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,179
Kwon Min-ju.

152
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,640
Well,

153
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,393
if I still need more practice,

154
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,896
that's fine.

155
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,903
I'll practice harder to imitate you.

156
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,365
I will become more like Han Jun-hee

157
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,492
than the original Han Jun-hee.

158
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,452
Why are you going this far?

159
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,289
Min-ju, now is not the time
for you to be like this.

160
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,084
Oh Chan-yeong is inside his older brother,
Oh Chan-hui.

161
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,671
He's going to kill you,
and he'll end up killing Si-heon too.

162
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,967
Okay? So you must hurry and tell Si-heon
in order to stop Oh Chan-yeong.

163
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,927
Okay?

164
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,681
Okay?

165
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,100
Min-ju.

166
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,769
Min-ju.

167
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,440
Hey, Min-ju! Kwon Min-ju!

168
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,818
Min-ju, wait a minute!

169
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,576
What was it?
Why did the police want to see you?

170
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,372
-Was it about Byeon Da-hyeon's case?
-Well, I…

171
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,710
The police believe
the same culprit is responsible

172
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,753
for both Byeon Da-hyeon's and my cases.

173
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,173
-I knew it.
-I was worried that might be the case.

174
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,052
So? What did the police say?

175
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,015
I might be in danger
until the attacker is caught,

176
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,435
so I should avoid going anywhere alone.

177
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,853
Especially at night.

178
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,063
They're right.
It's dangerous for you to be alone.

179
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,154
Until they catch him, I'll make sure
you get to and from school safely.

180
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,241
I hope they catch him soon.

181
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,161
Now that he's committed murder,
he's extremely dangerous.

182
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,540
It's fine.
You guys said you'd protect me, right?

183
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,375
I'm not worried at all.

184
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,170
Good to see you're staying positive.

185
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,588
Let's go in.

186
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,423
Let's go.

187
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,075
Don't you think
Kwon Min-ju was strange earlier?

188
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,370
She was strange. Really strange.

189
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,829
Think she was just nervous?

190
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,833
Was she simply on edge
because her classmate was killed,

191
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,170
or was she nervous
because she knew something?

192
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,804
Why did you let her go
without asking any more questions?

193
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,475
According to Byeon Da-hyeon's friends,
the last time they saw Byeon Da-hyeon

194
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,936
was in the hallway some distance
from the classroom.

195
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,023
That means someone overpowered her
and dragged her back to the classroom.

196
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,692
You think Kwon Min-ju could've done that?

197
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,487
Then we can exclude her
from the list of suspects.

198
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,364
Why did you think she was strange?

199
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,536
When Kwon Min-ju came
to the police station about Jung In-Gyu,

200
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,163
she looked right at me
and spoke very logically.

201
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,123
That's true.

202
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,834
But today,
she couldn't look me in the eye,

203
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,919
and her answers lacked conviction.

204
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,714
What could she be hiding?

205
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,884
27 RECORD

206
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,268
Han Jun-hee.

207
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,938
Nam Si-heon, you really came.

208
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,774
I told you I'd look out for you.

209
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
Let's go.

210
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,695
Okay.

211
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,966
Thanks for bringing me home.

212
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,884
Sure.

213
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,104
-What is it?
-Open it.

214
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,864
I got worried
when I couldn't get in touch with you.

215
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,283
Everyone has a pager these days.

216
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,953
Is it okay for me to accept this?

217
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,664
It wasn't very expensive. See you later.

218
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,878
Nam Si-heon.

219
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,845
Well,

220
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,557
I didn't know how to say thank you.

221
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,020
See you.

222
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,337
When I wake up in the morning
and leave the house…

223
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,547
AUGUST 29, 1998

224
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,341
…his smile when he comes to pick me up,

225
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,805
the warmth of his cheek
touching my lips earlier,

226
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,475
those things are all mine alone.

227
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,272
I am no longer alone.

228
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,610
For the first time in my life,
I am with someone.

229
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,155
May I dare to have hope

230
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,075
and expectations in this world?

231
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,289
There was nothing like this in the diary.

232
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,626
I don't remember seeing
anything like this.

233
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,737
That boy is…

234
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,618
Koo Yeon-jun.

235
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,455
You wrote that just now?

236
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,250
Why?

237
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,212
Why did you write that?

238
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,470
Did you write it for me to see?

239
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,433
That's right.

240
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,978
I wrote it for you to see.

241
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,858
You saw this sentence
and came back to 1998.

242
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,860
Why?

243
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,948
Why did you have to bring me back to 1998?

244
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,047
You had to come back into my body

245
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,927
so that Si-heon would continue
to like Kwon Min-ju.

246
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,346
Without Han Jun-hee,

247
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,516
I mean nothing to Si-heon, you know.

248
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,435
And

249
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,272
everything went
according to my plan in the end.

250
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,526
You came back
after seeing that phrase in this diary.

251
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,655
And Si-heon liked the me
that was Han Jun-hee.

252
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,491
You did all that

253
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,620
just because you wanted
to make Si-heon like you?

254
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,501
As long as Si-heon

255
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,880
keeps taking care of me,

256
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,259
I don't care if I have to pretend
to be you for the rest of my life.

257
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,971
But what's the point of doing all…

258
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,683
Actually, no.

259
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,101
Yes, Min-ju.

260
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,440
I also know what it's like
to like someone a lot.

261
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,611
So I think I understand
why you're doing this.

262
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,279
But, Min-ju--

263
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,655
You understand me?

264
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,533
Really?

265
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,538
If that's the case,
don't bother me anymore.

266
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,917
Wait a minute, Kwon Min-ju!

267
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,377
Just do me one favor.

268
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,175
On October 13,
Oh Chan-yeong will kill you.

269
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,384
So on that day,

270
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,969
hide at home or something.

271
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,514
Please, just don't go
anywhere near Oh Chan-yeong.

272
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,808
And tell Si-heon and In-gyu

273
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,519
what Oh Chan-yeong is going to do.

274
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,396
They both need to know
Oh Chan-yeong's identity.

275
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,276
Don't worry.

276
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,071
I won't die that easily.

277
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,281
No, it's not just you.

278
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,826
We have to stop Si-heon and In-gyu
from dying too.

279
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,619
Min-ju.

280
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,122
Min-ju, just what are you planning to do?

281
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,546
I'm going to do
what I've been dreaming of all this time.

282
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,258
Your time is now over…

283
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,097
but my time is just beginning.

284
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,392
Okay, that's it.

285
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,352
Attention!

286
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:55,895
Bow!

287
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,689
Thank you.

288
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,566
Bye.

289
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,154
Let's go to Seoul.

290
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,324
-Seoul?
-Yeah, let's go.

291
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,410
I even borrowed my uncle's camera.

292
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,873
Okay.

293
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,924
Why did we come to Lotte World?
Apgujeong Rodeo is a must-visit in Seoul.

294
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,136
There's a ride here
I really want to go on with you guys.

295
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,053
Which one?

296
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,770
That one.

297
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,696
Let's go.

298
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,825
She wants to ride it.

299
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,437
Nam Si-heon, are you okay?

300
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,698
Let's go again.

301
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,450
I'm good.

302
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,451
-Let's go.
-No.

303
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,702
-Let's go.
-No!

304
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,204
No!

305
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,291
-Do you want me to hold you?
-Yeah.

306
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,006
-Hey, grab hold of her.
-Okay.

307
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,232
-Hi.
-Who are you talking to?

308
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,109
Everyone does this. You do it too.

309
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,617
-Wait. I'll take a photo of you.
-A photo of us?

310
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,827
Okay.

311
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,037
One, two, three.

312
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,456
You guys look great.

313
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,507
What is it?

314
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,466
-No.
-Look here.

315
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,843
-I don't wanna.
-Look here.

316
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,137
Two, three.

317
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,139
-Si-heon.
-Yeah?

318
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,942
There are so many nice places in Seoul.
Why are we having ramyeon?

319
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,986
You know, on TV,

320
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,322
you see people eating ramyeon
and drinking beer by the Han River.

321
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,324
I really wanted to try it too.

322
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,702
And what's it like?

323
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,328
Even better than I imagined.

324
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,622
It's almost like I'm from Seoul.

325
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,169
All right, let's eat.

326
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,004
This is so good.

327
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,675
Yes, Grandma.

328
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,429
Yes, I've already had dinner.

329
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,224
How about you?

330
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,935
What are you doing?

331
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,662
The night view of the Han River
is truly beautiful.

332
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,164
Yeah.

333
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,305
-What's the matter?
-Huh?

334
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,723
Well,

335
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,769
I just remembered
that you'll be going to America.

336
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,981
You won't be able
to see the Han River for a while

337
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,650
once you go to America.

338
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,111
So take a good look now.

339
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,622
I'm thinking of not going to America.

340
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,583
What?

341
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,881
Well, it's just that if I go to America,
I won't have you or In-gyu.

342
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,134
I'll be bored all by myself, you know?

343
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,554
I think I'll ask my mom and dad

344
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,807
about living on my own here
when I get a chance.

345
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,101
Really?

346
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,687
Are you really going to stay in Korea?

347
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,523
Yeah.

348
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,150
Are you serious?

349
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,110
Well, I'm going to ask.

350
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,784
You're being serious, right?

351
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,339
-The photos all turned out great.
-Yeah, right?

352
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,682
-What's the matter?
-Huh?

353
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,186
Oh, I'm not used to seeing myself
like this.

354
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,855
This may be the first time
I've seen myself with this expression.

355
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,779
But you've been
laughing a lot lately, Jun-hee.

356
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,199
You never used to smile.
You just stared at the ground.

357
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,369
Right, I was like that.

358
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,875
-The photos turned out well, didn't they?
-Yes.

359
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,342
Please have these developed as well.
I'll come and collect them later.

360
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,427
Come in a couple of days
if it's not urgent.

361
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,180
Also, write your name
and phone number here.

362
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,270
PHOTO REQUEST
NAME: KWON MIN-JU

363
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,318
-Goodbye.
-Okay, bye.

364
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,904
Oh, it's raining.

365
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,281
You're right.

366
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,865
Let's hurry.

367
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,685
Nam Si-heon, what are you doing?

368
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,061
Come on.

369
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,813
Hurry, run! Nam Si-heon!

370
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,193
Si-heon.

371
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,446
Yeah.

372
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,001
Si-heon, come this way!

373
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,461
Here! Come on, In-gyu!

374
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,587
In-gyu!

375
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,589
Rebound.

376
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,258
-Nice!
-Good job!

377
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,010
-We have to stop In-gyu.
-I know.

378
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,219
Let's go again.

379
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,554
Here! He's going in!

380
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,556
Hey! Right here!

381
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,725
-He's going in.
-Hey, Si-heon! Wake up!

382
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,310
-Nice! Shoot!
-One more time!

383
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,227
That's it!

384
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,021
Nice!

385
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,898
-Good job.
-Nice!

386
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,317
You were both amazing. See you later.

387
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:22,943
See you tomorrow.

388
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,072
You're acting weird today.

389
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,491
You kept spacing out and losing the ball.

390
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,658
Is something wrong?

391
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,495
I'm just feeling a bit sluggish today.

392
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,084
If you're done playing basketball,
let's go see a movie.

393
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,752
Sure.

394
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,962
I have to go borrow a comic book.

395
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,215
-You two go.
-A comic book?

396
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,300
You can go after the movie.

397
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,346
It's a new one, so someone else
might take it if I don't go now.

398
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,098
Enjoy the movie.

399
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,980
I'll just go get my bag. Wait here.

400
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,898
Okay.

401
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,415
What's gotten into you?

402
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,461
Something happened, right?
That's why you're avoiding Min-ju.

403
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,303
About Min-ju,

404
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,099
don't you think something's off with her?

405
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,308
What is?

406
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,311
All she ever talked about before
was catching her attacker.

407
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,940
Now, she doesn't seem to care at all.

408
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,404
I thought Byeon Da-hyeon's case
would make her more determined.

409
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,282
What's even weirder

410
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,117
is that Min-ju…

411
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,745
isn't like Min-ju.

412
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,331
What are you talking about?

413
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,167
What I'm saying is

414
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,546
she's not the same person
as when she claimed to be Han Jun-hee.

415
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,674
She's similar to Han Jun-hee,

416
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,759
but something's very different.

417
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,139
It's like she's not Jun-hee.

418
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,019
She's gone back to the Kwon Min-ju
from before the accident.

419
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,938
Similar but different?

420
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,773
So what I'm saying is

421
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,067
that Kwon Min-ju

422
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,905
seems like she's imitating Han Jun-hee.

423
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,953
So what? What are you planning to do?

424
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,040
You can't just avoid her like you are.

425
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,166
I'm going to ask her.

426
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,585
-Ask her what?
-Whether something happened to her.

427
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,629
I'm sure something happened.

428
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,547
And then what?

429
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,133
Ask her to act the way
Han Jun-hee used to?

430
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,345
You can't ask her
to act more convincingly as Han Jun-hee.

431
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,554
No, that's not--

432
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,768
Wait, what did you just say?

433
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,316
Are you saying Kwon Min-ju
has been acting like she's Han Jun-hee?

434
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,526
Isn't that obvious?

435
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,071
Did you really believe Min-ju
when she said

436
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,781
she was Han Jun-hee from 2023?

437
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,033
How else could she become
a totally different person?

438
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,952
You said you believed her too.

439
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,119
You said you understood

440
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,872
why she changed so drastically
after hearing her story.

441
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,130
Then were you,

442
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,299
this entire time,

443
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,135
pretending to believe her?

444
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,139
Why?

445
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:44,687
Otherwise, it would've been difficult
for you and Min-ju to remain friends.

446
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,355
What?

447
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,859
Min-ju wants to be the girl you like,
so she's trying hard to be Han Jun-hee.

448
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,904
What could I tell her
when she's trying so hard?

449
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,324
Besides, you two like each other.

450
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,412
Pretending to believe Min-ju's lies

451
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,039
is a way for all three of us
to stay on good terms.

452
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,544
So,

453
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,006
can't you just play along with her lies?

454
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,802
She might be awkward as Han Jun-hee,
but you can turn a blind eye to it.

455
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,637
What on earth are you talking about?

456
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,100
Back then, Min-ju really was Han Jun-hee,
not pretending to be her.

457
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,061
How can you be so sure?
You just want to believe that!

458
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,063
I can tell by the way she looks at me!

459
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,233
I can tell from her face
when she looks at me.

460
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,529
She wasn't pretending to be Han Jun-hee.
She really was her.

461
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,240
Every single part of her…

462
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,285
was Han Jun-hee.

463
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,016
Is she back?

464
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,005
My uncle printed some extra copies
while he was at it.

465
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,548
This one's yours.

466
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,466
KWON MIN-JU

467
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,723
PHOTO REQUEST
NAME: KWON MIN-JU

468
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,455
MY UNCLE PRINTED SOME EXTRA COPIES
WHILE HE WAS AT IT

469
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,833
I HOPE THIS MUSIC TAKES YOU
TO YOUR HAPPIEST MOMENT

470
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:38,986
Well,

471
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,365
we're closing soon.

472
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,410
I'll be quick.

473
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,662
Okay.

474
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,053
It definitely is you, Kwon Min-ju.

475
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,895
Yeah, I knew it was you.

476
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,440
Nice to see you again.

477
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:03,070
Do you know how long I've been waiting
for you to come back?

478
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,366
27 RECORD

479
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,125
Kwon Min-ju.

480
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,462
Why didn't you wait at the store?

481
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,674
Hey, what's wrong?

482
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,592
I thought you weren't coming.

483
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,014
I said I'd take you home
for the time being.

484
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:42,813
Thanks.

485
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,692
Let's go.

486
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,599
Remember the first time we came here?

487
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,269
Of course I do.

488
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,938
It was when I stormed out of my house.

489
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,525
To make me feel better, you told me
your secret about going to America.

490
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,821
Why are you asking?

491
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,121
Are you perhaps

492
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,790
keeping anything from me?

493
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,794
Huh?

494
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,840
No. Nothing.

495
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,469
Why are you asking that?

496
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,016
The first time I came here
with Han Jun-hee…

497
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,938
I didn't talk about going to America.

498
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,150
If you really were Han Jun-hee,

499
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,778
you would've told me
what we talked about after your accident.

500
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,572
Back then,
Jun-hee told me about her dream.

501
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,699
In her dream, she was Han Jun-hee.

502
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,870
And she had a boyfriend
she really loved called Koo Yeon-jun.

503
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,290
Shouldn't you be talking about that?

504
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:32,297
Tell Si-heon the truth
before it's too late, Min-ju.

505
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,008
It's still not too late to tell him, okay?

506
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,052
You'll tell him, won't you?

507
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,638
Please be honest.

508
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:44,017
You're not Jun-hee right now, are you?

509
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,943
You're back to being Kwon Min-ju.

510
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,532
Of course I'm Han Jun-hee.

511
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,534
I've told you
I was Han Jun-hee several times

512
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,244
since I woke up in the hospital.

513
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,665
Why were you telling me
what Min-ju said before she woke up?

514
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,875
Oh, that?

515
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,002
Didn't I mention it?

516
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,005
When I came into Kwon Min-ju's body,

517
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,842
my memory and her memory merged as one.

518
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:20,720
So, of course, I thought
it was my memory and mentioned it.

519
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,703
Look at the back.

520
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,876
MY UNCLE PRINTED EXTRA COPIES
THIS ONE'S YOURS

521
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,921
At the photo studio the other day,
I saw you writing.

522
00:52:56,131 --> 00:53:00,719
I thought I might've been mistaken,
so I checked the writing on the tape too.

523
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,974
How will you explain
the different handwriting?

524
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,187
If you really are Han Jun-hee,
shouldn't your handwriting be the same?

525
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,819
Min-ju. Si-heon has figured it out.
Just tell him the truth now.

526
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,988
I'm telling you,
you can tell him right now.

527
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:24,242
Tell Si-heon
that you are Kwon Min-ju, please.

528
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,043
You're not Han Jun-hee.

529
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,716
Ever since you left my room,

530
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,261
you haven't been Han Jun-hee,
but Kwon Min-ju.

531
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,681
Something's been off since then.

532
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,518
Why can't you answer me?

533
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,479
Say something.

534
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,190
Why did you pretend to be her?

535
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,943
Kwon Min-ju, answer him quickly.

536
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,405
Tell him your attacker was Oh Chan-yeong
inside Oh Chan-hui's body.

537
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,242
Tell him
what Oh Chan-yeong will do in the future.

538
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,952
Hurry up and tell Si-heon.

539
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,621
Stop it!

540
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,419
Stop it.

541
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,174
If I…

542
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,887
if I tell you the truth…

543
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,767
what will happen after that?

544
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,481
If I tell you that Han Jun-hee is gone

545
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,985
and might never come back,

546
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,989
then will you still, like you do now…

547
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,244
continue to be nice to me?

548
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,457
Will you keep smiling at me
and talking to me?

549
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,127
Keep liking me?

550
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,764
Min-ju.

551
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,182
Forget it.

552
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,646
I know what you're going to say,
so you don't have to answer me.

553
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:20,900
Min-ju.

554
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,996
Just tell me one thing.

555
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,583
Can Jun-hee…

556
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,211
ever come back at all?

557
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,842
If she can't…

558
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,095
what do I have to do

559
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,140
to be able to meet her again?

560
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,195
How am I supposed to know that?

561
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,864
Did you actually believe

562
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:11,868
that Han Jun-hee from 2023
entered my body?

563
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,622
You know I made it all up.

564
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,709
Because you weren't interested in me,

565
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,505
I made up a person called Han Jun-hee
that I thought you might like

566
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,465
and pretended to be her.

567
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,678
No.

568
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,140
Don't do this, Min-ju.

569
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,227
Oh, Min-ju. Why are you doing this?

570
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,648
The lively and charming Han Jun-hee
from 2023

571
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,195
and the boyfriend she can't forget
no matter what, Koo Yeon-jun…

572
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,448
It's all a fake story that I made up.

573
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,452
So, even if you die…

574
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,956
even if you die,
you'll never see Jun-hee again.

575
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,422
Did you really…

576
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,551
make Han Jun-hee up?

577
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:11,928
Yeah.

578
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,016
Then I will never be able…

579
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,396
to meet Jun-hee again?

580
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,898
That's right.

581
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,359
Because it was all a lie from the start.

582
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:52,273
