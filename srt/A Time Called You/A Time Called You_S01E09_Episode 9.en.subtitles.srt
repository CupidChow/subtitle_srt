1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,133
What?

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,177
He dumped you right in front of her?

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,973
What a slimy asshole.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,267
I never liked that guy.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,061
Do you want me to go beat him up?

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,731
Forget it.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,108
Don't waste your energy
on someone like him.

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:29,946
Anyway,

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,699
how did you end up dating him?

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,453
Our club went to volunteer
at a children's home once.

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,456
Back then,
Do-hyeon was really nice to the kids.

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,751
Seeing that side of him
reminded me of my past.

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,171
When I was little,
I used to like this guy.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,007
A guy? Who was it?

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,510
I lived with my grandma
for a short while when I was young.

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,554
It was a guy living in that area.

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,723
He used to buy me tteok-kkochi

18
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,933
and tell off the boys who were mean to me.

19
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,186
I'd go to the snack bar to see him.

20
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,023
Was he the owner's son?

21
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,817
No, he just worked there part-time
making deliveries.

22
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,112
I told him my name was Han Jun-hee

23
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,947
and asked him to remember me.

24
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,991
I bet he doesn't remember me.

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,500
Hey! My name is Han Jun-hee.

26
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,754
Please remember my name
the next time we meet.

27
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,178
I can't really remember
what he looks like anymore,

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,347
but I still remember
how nice he was to me.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,933
Seeing Do-hyeon's caring side

30
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,685
reminded me of the guy from back then.

31
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,395
And that's why I dated him.

32
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,606
Hold on.

33
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,943
You're saying
you only dated that slimy asshole

34
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,861
because he reminded you of that guy?

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,155
-Yeah.
-That doesn't make sense.

36
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,075
I mean, how could you date him for--

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,745
Hang on. That means I ended up
doing that asshole a favor.

38
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,705
Damn it! Seriously!

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,375
What?

40
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,965
Never mind. I'm not mad.

41
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,802
Now that I think about it,
what's important now

42
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,264
is that, from this moment on,
you don't have a boyfriend.

43
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,850
So what?

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,061
That means that from now on,
I can pursue you freely.

45
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,604
In your dreams.

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,650
I don't plan on dating anyone for a while,
or maybe even forever.

47
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,777
Oh, that would be a disaster.

48
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,237
Why?

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,324
If you never date a man,
I can never date a woman either.

50
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,952
You're the only woman I'd date.

51
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,495
Stop joking around.

52
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,789
Those lines don't work on me.

53
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,794
I'm not joking.

54
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,219
Oh, I'm late.

55
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,263
The cake was great.

56
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,181
Thank you.

57
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,391
Wait.

58
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,698
Happy birthday.

59
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,037
Thank you.

60
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,747
I'm going.

61
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,555
A TIME CALLED YOU

62
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:39,779
IN MEMORY OF KWON MIN-JU

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,668
-Have you been taking care of it?
-Yeah.

64
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,382
So from now on,
say hi back when I say hi at school.

65
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,595
Min-ju.

66
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,727
Min-ju.

67
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,406
JUNG'S SNACK BAR

68
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,042
Grandma.

69
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,420
Why haven't you closed--

70
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,299
Grandma.

71
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,843
Grandma.

72
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,887
Grandma!

73
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,311
In-gyu.

74
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,568
You knew, didn't you?

75
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,405
You knew Grandma was ill?

76
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,242
Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,122
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

78
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,460
In-gyu.

79
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,837
Yes, Grandma.

80
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,422
Are you feeling okay?

81
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,675
Don't be like that to Si-heon.

82
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,515
Si-heon said we should tell you,

83
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,559
but I told him not to,

84
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,728
so he didn't.

85
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,607
So don't be like that to Si-heon.

86
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,151
He did nothing wrong.

87
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,278
By the time they found out

88
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,825
about my illness, it was too late.

89
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,954
There was nothing they could do.

90
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,997
Grandma.

91
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,210
Now that I have seen you
come out of prison,

92
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,421
it's all right.

93
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,839
Oh dear.

94
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,624
-Are you on a diet?
-I'm gonna eat your pork cutlet.

95
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,876
-No way.
-Hey there.

96
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,378
Oh, hi.

97
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,217
Look, it's Koo Yeon-jun.

98
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,848
He's so handsome.

99
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,225
Why should I?

100
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,979
-Na-eun.
-Yeah?

101
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,484
Is it just me, or are girls looking
at Yeon-jun while they're talking?

102
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,070
What do you think?

103
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,405
It's because they like him.

104
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,659
Is Yeon-jun popular?

105
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,286
They're all crazy for him.

106
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,372
Whether they're art majors
or business majors,

107
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,916
girls are dying to talk to him.

108
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,792
I see.

109
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,961
So, he's popular? Right.

110
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,924
That's why he was so confident
hitting on girls.

111
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,926
What? Hitting on girls?

112
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,303
Who? Him?

113
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,722
No way. Hey!

114
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,060
It's true
that Koo Yeon-jun is nice to all girls.

115
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,186
But even so,

116
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,065
it's not like Koo Yeon-jun
is particularly close with anyone

117
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,944
or going around hitting on girls
here and there.

118
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,654
That's what drives the girls crazy.

119
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,657
It's because he draws a line
and won't let anyone cross it.

120
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,246
Koo Yeon-jun is really like that?

121
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,581
You know Hong Ji-yeon, right?

122
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,875
Yes, the most popular girl in our major.

123
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,170
Yeah, her.
Yesterday, she told Koo Yeon-jun

124
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,549
that she likes him.

125
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,009
Really?

126
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,387
She must have been confident
'cause she's pretty.

127
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,889
More importantly, guess what he said.

128
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,891
What?

129
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,853
"I'm waiting for the one destined for me."

130
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,231
"I'll only be with one person in my life."

131
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,232
"But, Ji-yeon,

132
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,735
I'm certain it's not you."

133
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,448
-Hey, keep it down.
-Okay.

134
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,909
Unbelievable, isn't it?

135
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,828
He really rejected her for such a reason?

136
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,373
Don't you think
it's rare to see a guy like him?

137
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,667
As soon as he said, "It's not you,"

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,253
she started crying and ran out.

139
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,880
She was making such a fuss.
It was hilarious.

140
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,300
So,

141
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,553
Koo Yeon-jun is going around
hitting on girls?

142
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,179
Absolute nonsense.

143
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,893
What? What should I draw?

144
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,114
What about it?

145
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,510
Listening to something?

146
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,057
Koo Yeon-jun.

147
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,975
Yes?

148
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,394
What are you listening to?

149
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,147
Do you wanna listen to it?

150
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,450
It's Seo Ji-won.

151
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,245
Yeah. It's a nice song, isn't it?

152
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,288
Yeah, I really like this song.

153
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,583
But isn't this song quite old?

154
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,213
Whenever I hear this song…

155
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:00,428
it feels like it takes me
to a moment in my past.

156
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,389
What moment?

157
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,768
It could be the moment a certain someone
smiled at me for the first time.

158
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,813
Or it could be…

159
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,695
the moment that person
turned around to wave at me to hurry.

160
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,619
It must be your first love.

161
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,584
Isn't it?

162
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm talking about you.

163
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,133
I'm talking about you.

164
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,472
Hey, if you keep acting like this,

165
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,807
I might mistakenly think
you're being serious.

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:55,065
I'm just waiting for the moment you accept
that my feelings for you are real.

167
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,529
If you accept my feelings…

168
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,868
I will never leave your side.

169
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,797
Well, I…

170
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,591
I think I forgot to lock the door
when I left home.

171
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,093
Wait. Actually, I meant the stove.

172
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,179
I left home without turning the stove off.

173
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,948
Oh no. No way.

174
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,784
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

175
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,791
I'm going to focus only on my studies.

176
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,210
Yeah.

177
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,677
What do I do now?

178
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,688
Yeon-jun.

179
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,607
Koo Yeon-jun!

180
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,197
There you are.

181
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,867
What are you doing?

182
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,286
-Were you waiting for me again?
-Yeah.

183
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,455
You don't have to wait for me every time.

184
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,292
Say what you like, but I won't listen.
So just let me be.

185
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,471
-Huh?
-What?

186
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,725
-Those are the earrings I gave you.
-Oh, you mean these?

187
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:38,354
Well, I got them as a gift,
so I might as well use them.

188
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,817
You don't actually like them?

189
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,111
I mean, it's not like I don't like them.

190
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,614
I guess the design is fine too.

191
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,624
But if you go on like this,
you might get sick, you know?

192
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,211
With your studies and part-time work,
you seem to be overdoing it.

193
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,673
Still, I have to work hard
if I want to get a scholarship.

194
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,385
Last year, when my family
was going through a hard time,

195
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,596
I thought I'd have to drop out
and get a job.

196
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,848
I was really scared.

197
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,478
You really had it tough.

198
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,648
You know…

199
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,364
about how I told you
not to call me by my name…

200
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,577
I mean, we've gotten close now,

201
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,580
and we're the same age.

202
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,749
So just call me by my name.

203
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,336
Really?

204
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,672
Yeah.

205
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,592
Hey, Jun-hee.

206
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,264
Come on. You should answer me
when I call you, Jun-hee.

207
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,306
What is it?

208
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,394
Jun-hee.

209
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,229
Yeah?

210
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,481
Nothing, Jun-hee.

211
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,820
Hey, are you gonna keep doing that
until we get home?

212
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,738
Yes, Jun-hee.

213
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,658
Hey, Koo Yeon-jun.

214
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,993
Han Jun-hee. Jun-hee.

215
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,911
Hey, Koo Yeon-jun.

216
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,004
Where's Jun-hee?

217
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,630
Oh, hey, Yeon-jun.

218
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,051
I keep calling her,
but she's not picking up.

219
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,677
Why won't she answer?

220
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,804
Jun-hee's not the type to be late.

221
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,391
Well, she didn't look well yesterday.

222
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,269
Gosh, what do I do?
I have a group presentation today.

223
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,524
I'll go. Where does she live?

224
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,620
Hello?

225
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,373
What's wrong with your voice?
Are you sick?

226
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,667
I'm in front of your place,
so open the door.

227
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,626
My place?

228
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,877
Yeah.

229
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,337
Okay. Wait a moment.

230
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,721
Jun-hee.

231
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,641
Jun-hee!

232
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,310
Jun-hee!

233
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,945
Hey, Na-eun. It's me.

234
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,947
Do you know the code for Jun-hee's house?

235
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,868
The call suddenly cut out.
I think she passed out.

236
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,911
Yeah.

237
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,248
Yeah.

238
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,500
Okay.

239
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,715
Jun-hee, what's wrong? Jun-hee!

240
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,841
Jun-hee!

241
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,231
Jun-hee, are you okay?

242
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,316
Are you awake?

243
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,151
Yeah.

244
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,112
Let me go get the doctor.

245
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,119
Just stay by my side.

246
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,449
We should've taken a taxi.
When else would we take one?

247
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,203
-It's a waste of money.
-I wasn't going to ask you to pay.

248
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,538
I don't wanna waste your money either.

249
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,118
Thank you for today.

250
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,954
Huh? I'll see you to your door.

251
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,914
I can go up by myself.

252
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,375
What if you pass out again on your way up?

253
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,918
You still look pale.

254
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,628
I'm totally fine now.

255
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,130
Off you go.

256
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,551
All right.

257
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,845
Oh, here's your medicine.

258
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,432
Take it three times a day after meals.

259
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,475
Okay.

260
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,817
I'll see you go in, then head off.
Go in first.

261
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,069
Okay.

262
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,904
I'll go in.

263
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,328
Make sure you take your medicine.

264
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,769
-Do you know what day it is today?
-Today?

265
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,314
Well, it's not a public holiday.

266
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,816
Your birthday has already passed too.

267
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,860
I dunno. What day is it?

268
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,323
The day we started dating.

269
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,664
Hold on. What did you just say?

270
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,876
What?

271
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,629
So, are we dating now?

272
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,215
-Yeah.
-You're serious, right?

273
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,467
It's not because you're sick?

274
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,344
You're really serious, right? For real?

275
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,554
Hey, keep it down.

276
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,406
Hey.

277
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,493
Oh, right. You're still sick.

278
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,995
I should be gentle with you.

279
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,377
I'm really going in now.

280
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,170
Okay, go on in.

281
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,359
Grandma.

282
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,029
Grandma.

283
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,334
Don't leave me.

284
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,253
Grandma, don't leave me.

285
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,464
Grandma, please don't leave me.

286
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,787
When we were young,

287
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,207
do you remember the time…

288
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,254
I broke a bottle of ginseng wine
while I was over at your place?

289
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,839
Of course I do.

290
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,884
My dad treasured it so much

291
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,928
that he only had a few sips,
but you broke it.

292
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:20,847
But back then…

293
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,018
you lied to your parents…

294
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,106
and told them that you broke it.

295
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,276
You got into so much trouble.

296
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,699
Hey, I've never seen
such a death glare before.

297
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,077
Back then,

298
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,247
I thought to myself that I should tell him
I was the one who did it…

299
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,294
but I was too scared to do so.

300
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,798
It broke while we were playing together.

301
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,966
It doesn't matter who broke it.

302
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,305
I made a promise to myself back then.

303
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,189
"In the future…

304
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,155
if Si-heon does something so terrible
that everyone points their fingers at him…

305
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,868
I'll stay by Si-heon's side
until the end."

306
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,790
"Forever. Until we die."

307
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,378
"I'll stay by Si-heon's side."

308
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,884
Hey.

309
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,847
Isn't that quite an extravagant promise
for a kid in elementary school?

310
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,599
But

311
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,894
why are you suddenly bringing up the past?

312
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,065
I'm having all kinds of thoughts

313
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,985
now that I'm about to leave this place.

314
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,281
You're leaving this place?

315
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,242
After I sort this house out,

316
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,369
I may go to Seoul to find a job.

317
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,789
A cousin of mine living in Seoul
said he'd set me up with one.

318
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,919
Oh, really?

319
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,465
I should live a meaningful life,

320
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,717
if only for my grandma's sake.

321
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,678
So today, I'm going to drink all I want…

322
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,682
and start afresh tomorrow.

323
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,650
Okay. Let's drink.

324
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,159
No, you were…

325
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,786
-It wasn't even real ginseng.
-Really?

326
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,828
Yeah.

327
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,461
Acting all tough?

328
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,713
-Hey, In-gyu.
-You're here.

329
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,590
-Isn't it cold outside?
-It is.

330
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,924
In-gyu, put these up.

331
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:25,842
Okay.

332
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,844
That's pretty.

333
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,137
-It is, isn't it?
-Yeah.

334
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,513
In-gyu, look at this. Ta-da!

335
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,806
-It's itchy.
-Si-heon's scarf.

336
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,849
Hey, it's itchy!

337
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,435
Hey, take it off already.

338
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,562
-Suits him, right?
-Yeah, he looks like Miss Korea.

339
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,730
It's really cute.

340
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,907
-I'll turn it on.
-Okay.

341
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,410
Wow, it's really pretty.

342
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,870
-It's pretty.
-It's pretty.

343
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,787
-Right?
-Yeah.

344
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,208
Hey, it's snowing.

345
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,007
It's really pretty.

346
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,842
Those snowflakes are huge.

347
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,100
In-gyu.

348
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,527
In-gyu.

349
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,621
Jung In-gyu.

350
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,344
In-gyu, shortly after he was released,

351
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,097
killed himself.

352
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,144
In the exact same place Min-ju died.

353
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,987
Hey, Jung In-gyu.

354
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,864
Jung In-gyu!

355
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,325
In-gyu.

356
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,871
Hey! Jung In-gyu!

357
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,422
In-gyu.

358
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,551
Talk to me for a moment--

359
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,079
In-gyu!

360
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,916
In-gyu.

361
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,216
In-gyu!

362
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,347
In-gyu.

363
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,075
Gosh, you've got a stubborn cold,
haven't you?

364
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,244
When I get a cold,
it always lasts for ages.

365
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,124
I'll go buy some water.

366
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,501
Thank you.

367
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,763
Keep this on. You keep coughing.
I'll be right back.

368
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,738
Wow, Koo Yeon-jun.
He's got such long arms.

369
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,957
Yeon-jun smells really nice.

370
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,336
But I can't smell it
because my nose is stuffy.

371
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,893
Here you go.

372
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,811
Yeah.

373
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,280
-Jun-hee.
-Yeah?

374
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,159
Do I really smell that nice?

375
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,669
Oh, Yeon-jun,
I was wearing it like this before

376
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,504
because I was just so cold.

377
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,339
My whole body was shivering.

378
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,133
Why would I smell it?

379
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,538
You'll catch a cold.

380
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,377
I'll just catch it, then.

381
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,263
Are you…

382
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,269
Are you Nam Si-heon…

383
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,899
or Koo Yeon-jun?

384
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,243
Who the hell are you?

385
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,669
Jun-hee.

386
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,055
Yeon-jun. You can't put it there.

387
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,141
Hey, not up there. Put it down here.

388
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,685
No, this is perfect for a shelf.

389
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,144
That's because you're tall.

390
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,188
-Give me a moment.
-Put it lower.

391
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,690
Oh no!

392
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,817
Are you hurt? Is it bad?

393
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,278
It's okay.

394
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,737
Hey!

395
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,031
Jun-hee.

396
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,117
Huh? Oh, wait a moment.

397
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,618
-Two, three.
-Two, three.

398
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,788
Push it in. There we go.

399
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,832
Looks good. Are you hungry?

400
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,668
-We'll see.
-Okay.

401
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,199
I thought…

402
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,120
we'd be happy forever.

403
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,541
That is until that day came.

404
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,193
Hey, you're here.

405
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,782
That day, when you told me
you were going to the New York branch,

406
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,243
the only thing going through my mind

407
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,331
was that I never wanted to part
from you again.

408
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,625
But in the end,

409
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,503
we ended up having a massive argument,

410
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,548
and I went to the airport
to follow you to New York.

411
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,011
But before I got on the plane, I realized…

412
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,933
that no matter what I do,

413
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,977
whatever is meant to happen

414
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,730
will happen in the end.

415
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,318
That the outcome
in which I leave your side…

416
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,738
cannot be changed.

417
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,117
Then…

418
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,997
even before you got on the plane…

419
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,962
you already knew what was going to happen?

420
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,059
Your flight to New York
departs from Gate 32 at 11:40 a.m.

421
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,130
Nam Si-heon.

422
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,741
You probably know Koo Yeon-jun

423
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,828
will die in an accident
since Jun-hee told you.

424
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,998
But I'm sure you also don't know…

425
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,627
when and how he dies.

426
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,922
If you take this flight,

427
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,882
there will be a crash.

428
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,093
Your body,

429
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,179
I mean…

430
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,183
Koo Yeon-jun's body will really be dead.

431
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,353
Then your soul

432
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,732
will return to your real body in 2002,

433
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,027
which is lying in a coma
after the accident.

434
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,241
That's me.

435
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,540
So I'm here to tell you
not to get on this flight.

436
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,924
For the next flight to New York.

437
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,677
Get on this flight and go meet Jun-hee.

438
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,185
Then what will happen to you?

439
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,604
If I don't get on this flight,

440
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,231
how will Jun-hee…

441
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,819
be able to come to 1998 to see me?

442
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,730
In the end…

443
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,612
from the moment I met Jun-hee
as Koo Yeon-jun…

444
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,575
there couldn't be any other way.

445
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,833
I have to die
for us to meet for the first time…

446
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,464
and for us to love each other.

447
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,844
That's our fate.

448
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,441
If that Jun-hee is in this fate…

449
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,076
I must accept this fate as mine.

450
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,499
After that,

451
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,127
everything is just as you know.

452
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:12,259
The plane crashed shortly after takeoff.

453
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:17,806
And I…

454
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,641
PATIENT: NAM SI-HEON (21)

455
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,018
…woke up back in 2002

456
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,854
in my own body.

457
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,768
It was a mistake!

458
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,102
Kwon Min-ju!

459
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,562
What year is it now?

460
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,272
It's 2007, of course.

461
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,732
Yeon-jun.

462
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,818
For me, every single moment
that I spend with you is important!

463
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,236
"When you meet her,

464
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,655
grab her hand,
and never let go, no matter what."

465
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,823
I like you.

466
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,951
Nam Si-heon. I killed her.

467
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,286
That's me.

468
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,623
Nam Si-heon.
Get on this flight and go meet Jun-hee.

469
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,875
Nam Si-heon, let's go!

470
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,260
Si-heon!

471
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:39,846
Si-heon!

472
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,515
Doctor!

473
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,059
They said I woke up six weeks
after the accident.

474
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:46,978
And after that,

475
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,731
a really long and excruciating

476
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,818
rehabilitation awaited me.

477
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,114
I expected it to be difficult.

478
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,031
I'm okay.

479
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,785
But it was far worse than I imagined.

480
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,622
I wanted to give up countless times.

481
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,416
But each time, I kept going,

482
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,418
thinking of you.

483
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,509
It took me a little over a year

484
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,761
to be able to walk with a cane.

485
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,227
But that's when things really became hard.

486
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,816
I was under the same sky

487
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,819
at the same time as you…

488
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,865
but I couldn't go see you.

489
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,618
Because I knew where you were…

490
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,291
I was close enough to see you
whenever I wanted to…

491
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,752
but I couldn't.

492
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:01,845
So…

493
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,141
as I was waiting to meet you once again,

494
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,393
I looked back at everything

495
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,687
that happened.

496
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,771

DECEMBER: DEATH

508
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,518
"Have I perhaps missed anything?"

509
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,103
I'LL STOP IN-GYU'S DEATH NO MATTER WHAT

510
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,064
"If I tried, perhaps I could change
what was destined to happen."

511
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,440
Hey, Jung In-gyu!

512
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:46,992
In-gyu.

513
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,869
Talk to me for a moment--

514
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,208
In-gyu.

515
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,420
In-gyu!

516
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,464
But I couldn't change anything.

517
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,591
Anything at all.

518
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,179
Are you saying that everything
was decided from the beginning…

519
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,351
and we're simply following that fate?

520
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,400
That's what I thought.

521
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,320
But

522
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,448
that incident took place.

523
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,668
That day last year,

524
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,296
at the airport,

525
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,133
I met my other self, Koo Yeon-jun.

526
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,433
Nam Si-heon.

527
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,647
And I told my other self, Koo Yeon-jun,

528
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,984
exactly what I had heard.

529
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,365
So I'm here to tell you
not to get on this flight.

530
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,495
For the next flight to New York.

531
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:17,082
Get on this flight and go meet Jun-hee.

532
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,668
If I take the next flight…

533
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,464
are you certain

534
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,759
I can continue to be with Jun-hee?

535
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,637
If I don't die,

536
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,973
Jun-hee can't go back to 1998, can she?

537
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,560
Doesn't that mean
Jun-hee in the present and I…

538
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,689
will both disappear?

539
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,278
We'll all disappear.

540
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,325
If you take this flight, you will die.

541
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,205
This is the course of our fate.

542
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,927
But then,

543
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,305
an unexpected change occurred.

544
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,368
The memories Jun-hee and I
have made so far

545
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,370
are all here.

546
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,039
From now on, keep it safe.

547
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,602
You said it was my fate to die.

548
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,564
But you're wrong.

549
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,818
Me taking this flight and dying
is not my fate…

550
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:11,905
but my choice…

551
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:14,866
and my own will.

552
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,285
I'm doing this

553
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,330
so that Jun-hee can come to see me.

554
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,125
Whatever my fate may be,

555
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,545
I will definitely meet Jun-hee.

556
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,255
And I…

557
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,010
will love her.

558
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,272
I wanted to give her this myself.

559
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,656
Take good care of Jun-hee.

560
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:57,992
On my behalf…

561
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,871
please make her happy.

562
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,347
On the surface,

563
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,642
perhaps nothing has changed.

564
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,104
The plane crashed in the end,

565
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,273
and I, Koo Yeon-jun, died.

566
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,651
However,

567
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,864
having been through all the choices
and emotions as Yeon-jun, I know…

568
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,995
that we were changing our fate,
no matter how little…

569
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,832
through our own choices…

570
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,378
according to our own will.

571
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,334
It was for your birthday.

572
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,128
Sorry I gave it to you so late.

573
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,384
What are you apologizing to me for?

574
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,261
I'm the one who should apologize.

575
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,229
I'm sorry.

576
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,566
I'm so sorry for getting angry back then.

577
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,444
You're silly.

578
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,656
Do you still feel bad about that?

579
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,698
We're screwed for our final exam,
aren't we?

580
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:22,311
