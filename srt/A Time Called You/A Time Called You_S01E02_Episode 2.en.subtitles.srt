THE 27 RECORD SHOP, WHICH CLOSED DOWN
A FEW YEARS AGO, IS BUT A MEMORY TODAY

6
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,010
Just who is this girl?

7
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,265
Do-hun.

8
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:44,896
Kwon Do-hun.

9
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,025
You need to get up.
It's time to go to school.

10
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,825
You're gonna be late and blame me again.

11
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,076
Go away!

12
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,473
Min-ju.

13
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,436
Get Do-hun to have breakfast
before he goes to school.

14
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,565
Make sure he eats,
even if he says he doesn't want to.

15
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,568
Okay.

16
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,039
Eat before you go.

17
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,709
Why didn't you wake me up?
I must go early for cleaning duties.

18
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,753
-I woke you up earlier.
-When did you wake me up?

19
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,298
Whatever. It's all your fault if I'm late.

20
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,595
A TIME CALLED YOU

21
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,448
Kwon Min-ju.

22
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,744
He has something to say.

23
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,129
PE will be held outside.

24
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,428
Okay.

25
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,560
Where have you been?

26
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,105
Me? Oh, I just…

27
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:36,818
Come on.

28
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,044
Did we have homework?

29
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,063
You got this, Min-ju!

30
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,190
You got this.

31
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,947
You seem really close
to Nam Si-heon these days.

32
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,866
I often see you with him.

33
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,248
Lucky you, having a popular guy
like Nam Si-heon be so nice to you.

34
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,045
Get ready!

35
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,178
Hey, why are you so nice to Kwon Min-ju
these days? Do you like her?

36
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,139
-Or do you like her?
-What?

37
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,432
I mean, it's weird.

38
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,435
It's not like she's pretty
like Byeon Da-hyeon.

39
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,896
Why are you hanging out
with someone so gloomy?

40
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,067
Do I need a reason to be friends
with someone from my class?

41
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,737
Come on. We're not kids here.
A guy and a girl can't just be friends.

42
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,199
But then again,

43
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,411
girls like Kwon Min-ju will fall for you
if you show signs of kindness.

44
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,916
Take that back.

45
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,042
You little bastard.

46
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,253
I've been going easy on you
because you're sick.

47
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,882
Go ahead. I'm not scared of punks
like you who are all talk.

48
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,051
Sir, these two are fighting.

49
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,552
What? Who's fighting?

50
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,679
Wait.

51
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
I was mistaken.

52
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,684
-Stop playing around. I'm busy right now.
-I'm sorry, sir.

53
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,771
-Come with me, damn it.
-Hey, come on. Stop it.

54
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,815
-Get him later.
-Let's go. Come on.

55
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,153
Why did you do that?

56
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,783
You'll lose against him.
Park Min-sang is a good fighter.

57
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,911
No need to thank me.

58
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,382
-He's here.
-There he is.

59
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,472
Hey, Nam Si-heon.

60
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,851
At least you're not
as clueless as Jung In-gyu, huh?

61
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,645
Make sure he knows his place from now on.

62
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,777
Hey, you still should've
taught him a lesson for acting up.

63
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,154
-For your reputation.
-Shit.

64
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,698
What's the point
of beating up a wimp like him?

65
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,783
I felt sorry for him,
so I went easy on him.

66
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,994
Right? He's such an ass.

67
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:33,911
Too bad.

68
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,420
Aren't you the one who's the real wimp?

69
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,421
What?

70
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,592
Deep down, you were scared back there
when In-gyu didn't back down, weren't you?

71
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,890
If I hadn't stepped in,
he would have punched you.

72
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,852
Look at you, coward.

73
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,061
You bastard!

74
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,314
Hey! Come watch.

75
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,940
They're fighting!

76
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,797
Damn it.

77
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,177
Wipe your bloody nose, asshole.

78
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,644
Who went easy on who?

79
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,396
You're no match even for In-gyu,
you bastard.

80
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,698
Talk shit about In-gyu
or Kwon Min-ju one more time,

81
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,076
and you'll end up worse than this.

82
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,161
Do you understand?

83
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,082
I said, do you understand?

84
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,252
I got it.

85
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,384
Damn it.

86
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,683
27 RECORD

87
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,310
Han Jun-hee! I finally found…

88
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,479
Hey!

89
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,731
Jeez, are you looking
at that picture again?

90
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,900
You just can't take your eyes off of it.

91
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,695
I'm starting to get upset.

92
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,238
Why? Over what?

93
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,365
I'm talking about this girl.

94
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,201
Doesn't she look prettier than me
the more you look at her?

95
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,869
What do you think?

96
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,290
I think that she looks exactly like you.

97
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,375
Come on. Take a closer look.

98
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,836
Don't you think she's cuter than me?

99
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,006
Maybe it's because she's young.

100
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,221
-What is it?
-Hey.

101
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,059
Are you becoming jealous of Yeon-jun now?

102
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,896
-Ridiculous, isn't it?
-Totally.

103
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,065
I envy you.

104
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,777
When am I ever going to experience
that kind of love?

105
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,658
It still bothers me,

106
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,496
the thought that Yeon-jun might have
liked me because I look like that girl.

107
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,799
HOW THE MELODY OF THE 27 RECORD SHOP
TURNED INTO THE AROMA OF COFFEE AT CAFE 27

108
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,976
Is this the 27 Record Shop in the picture?

109
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,564
Actually, I looked it up,
but they closed a few years ago.

110
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,857
That's right. They did.

111
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,445
But the owner of the 27 Record Shop
opened another business, which is…

112
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,199
Cafe 27?

113
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,116
Bingo.

114
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,786
How did you find out?

115
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,122
I searched the Internet obsessively
instead of doing my job.

116
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,458
So? Wanna go there with me after work?

117
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,139
Oh, I forgot.

118
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,809
I have to leave first
to go to the academy.

119
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,103
But you don't have classes today.

120
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,188
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

121
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,356
-I do.
-No, you don't.

122
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,649
Yes, I really do.

123
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,072
I'm leaving
so you can be alone with her, dimwit.

124
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,741
I'll get going.

125
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,993
-You take her home.
-Okay.

126
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,016
Si-heon can be quite cheeky, can't he?

127
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,602
But he's actually a nice guy.

128
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,066
How long have you been friends
with Nam Si-heon?

129
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,573
We've been friends
since elementary school.

130
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,243
You're so lucky.

131
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,501
You guys are not just any friends.
You're best friends.

132
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,255
I wish I could know how it feels…

133
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,009
to have a friend like that.

134
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,111
That's the hearing aid that I always wear.

135
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,199
Without it, I can't hear anything
in my right ear.

136
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,202
I guess you didn't know.

137
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,662
I didn't notice it at all.

138
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,499
Ever since I started wearing
the hearing aid,

139
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:18,005
kids would make fun of me,
calling me handicapped or a grandpa.

140
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:24,178
I really hated going to school,
but then Si-heon approached me.

141
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,268
What's that in your ear?

142
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,772
-It's a hearing aid.
-What's that?

143
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,610
I can't hear out of one ear, so I have to
wear the hearing aid so I can hear.

144
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,113
Wow, that's interesting.
Can I try it on too?

145
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,114
Huh?

146
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,254
This is my favorite marble.
I'll give it to you.

147
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,964
In return, let me wear it once.

148
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,764
Okay.

149
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,948
Hey, what are you doing?

150
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,626
What are you doing?

151
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,299
You have a really cool device. I envy you.

152
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,968
Ever since that day,

153
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,097
Si-heon would beat up anyone
who teased me about my hearing aid.

154
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,099
He's always on my side, no matter what.

155
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,938
That's when I realized
what a true friend is.

156
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,902
Let me ask you just one thing.

157
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,739
Does it bother you
that I wear a hearing aid?

158
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,078
From now on,
you're my friend, like Si-heon.

159
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,747
Really?

160
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,457
Absolutely.

161
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,960
So from now on, say hi back
when I say hi at school.

162
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,589
You'll do that, won't you?

163
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,725
So, if you take your hearing aid out,

164
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,480
you only have one ear
to understand what someone is saying?

165
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,944
I can also understand them
by reading their lips.

166
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,155
I know how to read lips a bit.

167
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,950
I see.

168
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,496
Huh? What?

169
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,706
Are the lights off?

170
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,000
Are they already closed?

171
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,838
CLOSED TODAY

172
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,006
They're closed today.

173
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,842
Man, that's just our luck, I guess.

174
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,428
Come on. Let's come back later.

175
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,117
The train is approaching the station.

176
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:39,540
Please mind the gap between the platform
and the train as you exit and board.

177
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,429
The doors are closing.

178
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,120
Why aren't you getting changed?

179
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,889
Don't smile like that.

180
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,936
By any chance…

181
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,525
are you hoping
that I fall in love with you…

182
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,530
because you look like the girl
in that picture?

183
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:05,913
Because you'd be able to finally let me go
if that was the reason?

184
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,251
That's it, isn't it?

185
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,757
You were looking for a reason
to let me go.

186
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,469
Yes.

187
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,930
You're right.

188
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,351
I want to find evidence
that your love for me wasn't genuine

189
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,271
so that I can forget you.

190
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,401
If I don't do that,

191
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,239
how could I possibly get over you?

192
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,241
How?

193
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,868
I still

194
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,830
can't accept that you're gone.

195
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,795
But people keep telling me
that I need to move on.

196
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,091
But if you say you always loved me,

197
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,386
how could I possibly get over you?

198
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,766
Just before,

199
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,228
I even saw you at the subway station.

200
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:16,358
Even though I knew
that my mind was playing tricks on me

201
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,195
and that it was not real,

202
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,782
I still thought my heart would stop.

203
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,207
If you…

204
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,545
if you were going to leave me like this…

205
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,675
you shouldn't have come into my life.

206
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,346
How do you expect me to go on by myself?

207
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,310
If you were going to do this to me,
if things were going to end up like this,

208
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,605
you shouldn't have come into my life
in the first place!

209
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,069
Right?

210
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,894
"No one is alone. Neither am I."

211
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,357
"Even on a day when you stand as a loner
under the sky, at least the sky is…"

212
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,568
You got this, Min-ju!

213
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,737
You got this.

214
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,366
Why on earth
would they want to be friends with me?

215
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,412
Is it like a pyramid scheme or something?

216
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,430
I told you
I'm going to take Do-hun with me!

217
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,266
Who are you to stop me
from taking my son with me?

218
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,769
As if you can be a good dad!

219
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,438
Should I let him learn
how to cheat like his father?

220
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,942
Hey, it's way better than learning
from a mother who works at a bar!

221
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,530
Do you think I do it because I want to?

222
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:30,492
I wouldn't have to work like this
if you brought home money!

223
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,745
If you continue to be like this,

224
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,290
I'll take Do-hun and disappear somewhere
where you'll never find us!

225
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,501
Go ahead and try.

226
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,628
You'll never be able to hide from me.

227
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,340
Instead of arguing,
why don't we just call Do-hun here?

228
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,884
Let's ask him who he wants to live with.

229
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,094
Will you please stop?

230
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,972
That's a good idea. We'll just ask Do-hun.

231
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,683
Why? You can't really think
that he'd want to go with you.

232
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,810
Will you both please just stop?

233
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,731
How long have you been there?

234
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,235
Seeing as how both of you are arguing
only about who takes Do-hun,

235
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,822
I suppose you don't care
what happens to me.

236
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,283
Hey, that's not true.

237
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,452
It's just that Do-hun is still young, so--

238
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,495
I'm still young too!

239
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,874
I'm also still a minor,

240
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,461
and I can still get hurt too, okay?

241
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,673
Why do I always
have to play second fiddle?

242
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,178
How could you two do this to me? How?

243
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,307
-Hey, Min…
-Min-ju.

244
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,083
What are you doing here?

245
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,547
How about you?

246
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,967
I heard Titanic was good, so I rented it.

247
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,521
I don't think you'd answer me
if I asked you why you were crying.

248
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,652
Then let's do this.

249
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,197
If you tell me why,
I'll tell you a secret of my own.

250
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,992
Then you won't have to worry about
me telling anyone. What do you think?

251
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,745
I really won't tell anyone.

252
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,503
It's just that

253
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,341
it seems like my mom and dad only care
about my little brother.

254
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,552
I was crying because it upset me.

255
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,012
Little brother?

256
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,974
It's been like that
ever since we were little.

257
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,561
They'd forget about my birthday
and just let it pass,

258
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,606
but on my brother's birthday,
they'd buy him a cake

259
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,817
and presents too.

260
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,282
But it's not just that.
It's always how everything is for me.

261
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,493
Whether it's at home or at school,

262
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,538
I guess I'm not very noticeable.

263
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:35,969
My secret is that after our second year,
I'll be emigrating to the US.

264
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,263
What? But why?

265
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,889
Like many others,

266
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:45,103
my parents had a flourishing restaurant
that went under because of the IMF Crisis.

267
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,524
We're going to live
with my grandpa in the US.

268
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,447
Hey, this is a secret
that even In-gyu doesn't know.

269
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,657
You can't tell him, okay?

270
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,660
But you're best friends with In-gyu.

271
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,495
So, why?

272
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,921
Because it's obvious In-gyu will be sad
if I tell him that I'm moving away.

273
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,887
I don't want us to be sad
during the little time we have left.

274
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:27,479
I don't know about anything else,
but I'm really good at making friends.

275
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,149
That's why I'll be fine
when I move to the US.

276
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,276
But

277
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,071
it's different for In-gyu.

278
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,328
That's why I'm hoping
you'll be good friends with him.

279
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,414
So that even if I'm not here,

280
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,002
he won't become a loner like before.

281
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,552
27 RECORD

282
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,395
The album your friend ordered is here.

283
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,217
-Hey, give that back!
-Thanks for the Choco Pie!

284
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,177
You'll be dead meat when I catch you!

285
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,555
-Go ahead and try!
-Give it back!

286
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,266
-You got this, Si-heon!
-Go for it!

287
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,308
You're amazing!

288
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,477
-Nice!
-Nice!

289
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,271
He's so good!

290
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,072
You got this!

291
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,117
-Nice!
-Nice!

292
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,620
Nam Si-heon!

293
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,748
Nam Si-heon!

294
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,167
He's so cool!

295
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,085
Nice!

296
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,295
Si-heon is awesome!

297
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,508
Nam Si-heon!

298
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,636
Nam Si-heon!

299
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,722
-Go for it!
-Go, Si-heon!

300
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,247
Hey, Kwon--

301
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,338
Hey, Kwon Min-ju!

302
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,632
Yes?

303
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,425
Why are you so lost in thought?

304
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,054
I… Over there…

305
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,018
You should say hello
when a friend greets you.

306
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,442
I heard you promised In-gyu
you'd greet him if he said hello.

307
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,862
Then you should greet me too.
I'm your friend as well.

308
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,913
Hasn't Seo Ji-won's album come in yet?

309
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,751
No.

310
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,341
Please ask our testers
to upload photos with and without editing.

311
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,260
Oh, and take a look at this.

312
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,721
Instead of uploading
only the same old selfies like these,

313
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:53,351
ask them to mix in some scenery
or food photos that are Instagram-worthy.

314
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,811
-Okay. I understand.
-Okay.

315
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,064
Do you know where Ms. Han Jun-hee is?

316
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,315
Ms. Han is over there.

317
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,233
-There?
-Yes.

318
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,361
Excuse me, Ms. Han Jun-hee?

319
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,738
-Yes?
-Here's a package for you. Bye.

320
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,867
TO MS. HAN JUN-HEE

321
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,785
I wonder who sent it.

322
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,287
What time?

323
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:13,955
Hey, Jun-hee.

324
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,749
Come over here. Come on.

325
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,086
-Yes?
-Hey.

326
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,672
Cafe 27 is open today. Do you want to go?

327
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,934
Hello.

328
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,478
Hello.

329
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,484
Excuse me.

330
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,529
Are you the owner of this place?

331
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,285
Min-ju…

332
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,458
The name you just said, Min-ju,

333
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,169
is that the name of the girl
in this photograph?

334
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,302
Of course I recognize this picture.

335
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,264
I'm the one who took it.

336
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:14,933
Oh, you did?

337
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,853
Then you must know
who the kids in this picture are too.

338
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,564
This girl is my niece.

339
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,524
Her name is Kwon Min-ju.

340
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,945
When I ran a record shop in Noksan,

341
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,156
my niece would come help out
from time to time.

342
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:36,287
So, do you know who this boy is, then?

343
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,958
I think he's Min-ju's friend from school.

344
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,881
Do you know his name by any chance?

345
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,509
I'm not really sure about his name.

346
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,055
Whenever Min-ju was working at the shop,

347
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,558
these two boys came to visit quite often.

348
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,520
Then, could you please give us
your niece's number?

349
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,108
Oh, that's a little…

350
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:10,613
Sir, we just need to check something
about the guy in this picture.

351
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,324
That's why we want to talk to your niece.

352
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,286
We're not trying to do anything creepy,
so you don't have to worry.

353
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,330
You really don't have to worry.

354
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,293
It wasn't because of that.

355
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:29,424
It's just that I can't contact my niece,
even if I wanted to.

356
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,223
It's been a long time

357
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,309
since Min-ju passed away.

358
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,690
27 RECORD

359
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,990
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

360
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,285
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

361
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,870
Happy birthday, dear

362
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,748
-Kwon Min-ju
-Kwon Min-ju

363
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,209
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

364
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,213
What are you doing?

365
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,216
-Make a wish and blow out the candle.
-Right.

366
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,453
Min-ju.

367
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,639
In-gyu took ages to pick out that gift.

368
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,266
He said yours was really old.

369
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,937
Thank you.

370
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,699
-You're not sad anymore, are you?
-Huh?

371
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,829
The other day, you were upset your parents
only celebrated your brother's birthday.

372
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,726
I just remembered.
I have to help my grandmother.

373
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,648
-At this hour?
-Yeah.

374
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,068
-Please take Min-ju home.
-What?

375
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,906
Hey! Jung In-gyu!

376
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,868
What was that?

377
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,421
Shall we go, then?

378
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:16,883
Okay.

379
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,353
Hold on tight. You don't want to fall
and get hurt on your birthday.

380
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,230
Okay.

381
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,926
Thank you for the ride.

382
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:00,927
Sure. Go on in.

383
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,182
Wait. I have something to give you.

384
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,775
Oh, it came in.

385
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,529
But I don't have any cash on me.

386
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,532
You can just have it.

387
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,537
You gave me an expensive birthday gift.

388
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,457
I bought it with In-gyu.

389
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,211
Okay.

390
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,963
Thanks for the tape.

391
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,474
I HOPE THIS MUSIC TAKES YOU
TO YOUR HAPPIEST MOMENT

392
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,768
Oh, I…

393
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:56,065
I was just hoping
you'd be happy when you listened to it.

394
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,987
Okay. Thanks.

395
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,659
Nam Si-heon.

396
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,955
Thank you so much
for wishing me a happy birthday.

397
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,875
I didn't think you'd remember what I said.

398
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,467
In-gyu did so much to throw you
that surprise birthday party today.

399
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,848
In-gyu was the one who asked your uncle
and found out your birthday was today.

400
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,313
I hope you know how much effort
he put in to make you happy.

401
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,362
Do you know what my wish was
when I blew out the candle?

402
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,033
I wished that I could become
the kind of girl you like.

403
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,952
So that someday…

404
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,082
that someday, you would like me back.

405
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,795
I know…

406
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,757
I know you won't like me
as I am right now.

407
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,218
Even if it's far into the future,

408
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,763
if I really become the kind of girl
you could like--

409
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,848
I'm never going to like you in that way.

410
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,026
Is it because In-gyu likes me?

411
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,987
Because he's your friend?

412
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,655
It has nothing to do with In-gyu.

413
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,492
I consider you a friend.

414
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,620
I've never thought of you
as anything else.

415
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,334
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear what you just said.

416
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,004
So make sure you don't show it
in front of In-gyu. Okay?

417
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,259
I'll get going.

418
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,327
Kwon Min-ju passed away in 1998.

419
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,580
That picture was also taken
in the same year.

420
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,835
In 1998, Yeon-jun was in the fourth grade.

421
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,586
So he was 11 years old.

422
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,633
So there's no way that guy is Yeon-jun.
No way whatsoever.

423
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,593
So that's that! Right?

424
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,180
I guess you're right.

425
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,683
He wasn't Yeon-jun after all.

426
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,521
Hey! You were worried about nothing.
So, why do you still look so sad?

427
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,356
If…

428
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,861
that guy was Yeon-jun

429
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:52,283
and that girl was really someone
that Yeon-jun liked,

430
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,620
would that have helped me get over him?

431
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,210
Everyone else seems…

432
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,467
to be getting ready to let him go.

433
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,762
But I don't understand
why I can't do that.

434
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,482
I can't continue like this.

435
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,475
Mom.

436
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,811
Mom?

437
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:04,855
Do-hun!

438
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,273
Kwon Do-hun!

439
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,151
Mom!

440
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,070
Mom!

441
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:46,939
Seo Ji-won?

442
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:59,910
"I hope this music takes you
to your happiest moment."

443
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,040
What do I do, Uncle?

444
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,043
Mom took Do-hun and ran away from home.

445
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,922
Last time, she said she was going to take
Do-hun and disappear.

446
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,175
She really must have run away without me.

447
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,012
What am I going to do now?

448
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,805
I'll be right over.

449
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:20,723
Min-ju.

450
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,351
Don't cry. Wait there for me.

451
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,228
Okay.

452
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,931
NOKSAN TRANSPORTATION

453
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,381
Oh, taxi!

454
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,622
Yeon-jun.

455
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,084
It was my birthday a few days ago.

456
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,422
This was the first year
I spent my birthday without you.

457
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,718
The birthday wish I made this year…

458
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,889
was to let me see you again,
just once more.

459
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,100
Yeon-jun.

460
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,644
I miss you.

461
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,157
Even if it's just once…

462
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,326
please come to me.

463
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,625
Taxi!

464
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,587
Taxi!

465
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,086
UNREAD

466
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,130
READ

467
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,091
YEON-JUN

468
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,991
I keep forgetting my birthday
because you take care of it like this.

469
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:08,951
Ms. Han Jun-hee?

470
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,245
I'm never going to like you in that way.

471
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:15,582
I can't bear to be apart from you
for a single week, let alone a year.

472
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,044
No. I won't do it.

473
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,611
Kwon Min-ju, I'm back again.

474
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,281
Kwon Min-ju.

475
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:40,500
When my letter of tears reaches the sky

476
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:48,592
Someday, you will come back

477
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:52,721
To me

478
00:48:55,641 --> 00:49:01,772
Dear, I'm going to wait…

479
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,856
Hey, Kwon Min-ju!

480
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,572
Kwon Min-ju!

481
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,366
Are you awake?

482
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,829
Do you recognize me? Do you?

483
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,210
Yeon-jun.

484
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,259
Hey, what's wrong? Are you in pain?

485
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,059
Yeon-jun.

486
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,020
Are you really Yeon-jun?

487
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,106
Are you?

488
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,317
You…

489
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,904
you're really Yeon-jun, right?

490
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,324
Yeon-jun.

491
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,161
I missed you.

492
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,293
I missed you so much, Yeon-jun.
