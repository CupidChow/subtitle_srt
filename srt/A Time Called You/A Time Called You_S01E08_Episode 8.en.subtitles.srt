00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,570
Koo Yeon-jun.

2
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,196
Hey, you're here.

3
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,408
I'm a little late.

4
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,584
It's a gift. You always save me a seat.

TOP CLASS CSAT RETAKE ACADEMY

6
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,596
Actually,

7
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,557
for some time…

8
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,687
Actually, for some time, I…

9
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,122
Hey, Koo Yeon-jun!

10
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,714
Why didn't you wake me up?

11
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,390
This is killing me.

12
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,559
I can't focus on studying.

13
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,686
At this rate,
I might retake the CSAT again.

14
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,216
Hey, Yeon-jun.

15
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,053
Why do you think
I come to an academy all the way here

16
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,680
instead of one nearby?

17
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,473
Why?

18
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,685
I waste three hours going back and forth

19
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,690
to come to this academy
just because of this one person.

20
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,321
Because of me?

21
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,081
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

22
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,502
Jeez, you're frustrating.

23
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,049
What are we going to do about this?

24
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,052
Do about what?

25
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,322
Let's go in.

26
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:16,673
TOP CLASS ACADEMY

27
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,138
What's that? Is it yours?

28
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,225
My mom's. I brought it secretly
so we could go somewhere.

29
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,395
You only got your license the other day.

30
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,647
That's why I need more practice.

31
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,857
Come on. Get in quickly.

32
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,734
Let's escape this boring academy.

33
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,214
Hey, stop looking at the map.

34
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,966
Did you come all the way here
to read books?

35
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,678
We should know where we're heading.
You haven't gotten used to driving yet.

36
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,097
We can just go wherever the road takes us.

37
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,433
Wrong turns can take us
only as far as Busan.

38
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,146
Should we stay overnight?

39
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,441
What?

40
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,504
You're nervous
because you're a new driver, right?

41
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,049
As if I'm…

42
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,719
As if I'm nervous. I'm great at driving.

43
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,014
Shut up and look for some CDs in there.

44
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,724
CDs?

45
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,060
I don't think there are any CDs.

46
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,271
No way. There should be.
I'm sure my mom puts them in there.

47
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,856
No, there aren't any CDs.

48
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,193
No, take a closer look.
There must be some--

49
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm telling you, they're in there.

50
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,245
I definitely saw my mom put them in there.

51
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,293
A TIME CALLED YOU

52
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,774
Hello? Oh, is this Ye-ji's mother?

53
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,067
Yes.

54
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,361
Oh, her tutoring lesson?

55
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,531
Yes, that's okay. I think it'll be fine.

56
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,742
Yes, I'm on my way right now.

57
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,826
Okay.

RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
KOO YEON-JUN

59
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,586
You were on the brink of death
not too long ago.

60
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,339
Do you really have to leave home
to study like this?

61
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,342
Why don't you just study at home?

62
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,677
I want to save the time
it takes me to travel.

63
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,555
I'm going to study hard.

64
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeon-jun.

65
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,271
I promise.

66
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,108
I won't skip meals
and will take good care of myself.

67
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,903
I'm all grown up now.

68
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,532
Gosh, don't worry about me.

69
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,034
Please call me right away

70
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,788
if you suddenly feel unwell
while you're studying.

71
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,457
-Promise me, okay?
-I will.

72
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
It's not like he's leaving forever.

73
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,211
Quick, off you go.

74
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,380
I'll set off, then.

75
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,840
-See you.
-Take care.

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,483
OPENING SPECIAL
1,000-WON DISCOUNT FOR AN AMERICANO

77
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,074
We're closed for the day.

78
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,912
I brought a gift to celebrate the opening,
so please accept one more customer.

79
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,913
Si-heon.

80
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,083
I told you, I'm Koo Yeon-jun now.

81
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,043
I've always wondered.

82
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,088
The record shop and café
both have 27 in their names.

83
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,048
Does it have any meaning?

84
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,678
Jimi Hendrix.

85
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,848
Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain.

86
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,896
There's a thing called the 27 Club,
which refers to the group of artists

87
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,982
who died at the age of 27.

88
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,151
I got it from there.

89
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
They all died so young.

90
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,449
You're right.

91
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,995
But even if they are long gone
and no longer present,

92
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,040
their music will always be by our side.

93
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,504
Even if they're not by our side,

94
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,716
they are with us forever?

95
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,426
Exactly.

96
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,472
That's why I can't help but love music.

97
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,436
Oh, what are your plans going forward?

98
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,858
I'll be going to the art academy
to prepare for the college entrance exam.

99
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,402
Speaking of which,

100
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,946
can you give me a part-time job?

101
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,200
I want to earn money for the academy
and basic living expenses.

102
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,868
You want to major in art?

103
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,039
Wait, you're not--

104
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,918
Yes, I'm going to go
to the same college as Jun-hee.

105
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,761
I've been thinking a lot
ever since coming here.

106
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,891
"I'm Koo Yeon-jun now, not Nam Si-heon."

107
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,602
"So, what should I do from now on?"

108
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,897
According to Jun-hee,

109
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,150
the two of them met
while attending the same university.

110
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,487
Are you planning to do
exactly as Jun-hee said?

111
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,404
Yes.

112
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,950
That's how I'll turn this Koo Yeon-jun

113
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,953
into the person Jun-hee remembers in 2023.

114
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,705
If I go on like that,

115
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,542
I'll be able to change everything…

116
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,380
that happened on October 13, 1998.

117
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,509
No.

118
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,095
I must change it.

119
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,228
Sure. Giving you a part-time job
shouldn't be hard.

120
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,021
You can start tomorrow.

121
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,107
Thank you.

122
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,696
Si-heon.

123
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,243
I found these
while sorting out Min-ju's stuff.

124
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,539
But for some reason,
I ended up keeping some of them.

125
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
Now that I think about it,

126
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,295
they're your memories as well.

SOOSEONG ACADEMY

128
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,338
They are called noun equivalents,

129
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,966
and they're used quite similarly to nouns.

130
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:13,931
Miss.

131
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,142
How does that light reflect
from this angle?

132
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,270

-I got in.

-Hey, Jun-hee.

00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,297
Let's go.

00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,764
Hello!

148
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,104
Our dear freshman,
why don't you join our dance club?

149
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,939
Okay. See you tomorrow.

150
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,492
-Min-ji.
-You're here!

151
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,203
Good job. Go grab something to eat.

152
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,412
-Good luck.
-Sure.

155
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,936
Are you here to join our club?

156
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,854
Sorry?

157
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,107
Yes.

158
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,317
Please take a seat.

159
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,493
Hello.

160
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,663
Are you a freshman this year?

161
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,040
Yes, I'm a freshman art major.

162
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,125
Oh, so you're an art student.

163
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,461
How about you?

164
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,922
I'm a sophomore business major.

165
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,465
My name is Han Jun-hee.

166
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,304
-Han Jun-hee.
-Yourself?

167
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,393
I'm Koo Yeon-jun.

00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,310
Koo Yeon-jun.

169
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,696
Well, our club president
is not here right now,

170
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,240
but feel free
to fill out an application form.

171
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,075
Or we have a brochure about our club,

172
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,160
so you can take a look and decide later.

173
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,370
Would you like one?

174
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,956
Yes, please.

175
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,502
Let's see. Here it is.

176
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,756
Here.

177
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,009
Take a look,
and be sure to come back next time.

178
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,761
Oh, take this too.

179
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,520
Goodbye, Yeong-jun.

00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,692
Come join our soccer club.

181
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,875
Oh, are you back to fill out the form?

182
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,419
Here you go.

183
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,879
I like you.

184
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,756
Sorry?

185
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,215
I like you, Jun-hee.

186
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,056
Are you talking to me right now?

187
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,141
Yes, I am.

188
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,480
Didn't we just meet a few moments ago?

189
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,901
My feelings for you have nothing to do
with how long we've known each other.

190
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,863
I've known you for a very long time,
even before I met you, Jun-hee.

191
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,616
It's been a difficult journey to meet you.

192
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,118
I don't want to waste any more time.

193
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,037
I like you, Jun-hee.

194
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,924
Hey, you're a complete lunatic.

195
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,469
You look totally normal,
but you're definitely out of your mind.

196
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,470
Sorry?

197
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,597
Hey, I already have a boyfriend.

198
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,725
Who's got a boyfriend? You?

199
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,229
Yes, me. I have a boyfriend.

200
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,981
And why the hell
do you keep speaking casually to me?

201
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,651
I repeated a year, so we're the same age.

202
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,528
But what boyfriend--

203
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,695
Hey!

204
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,615
But I'm still a year ahead of you, right?

205
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,492
If you don't want
to be beaten like a drum,

206
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,453
show some respect
and stop calling me by my name.

207
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,456
-Jun-hee.
-Oh, Do-hyeon.

208
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,417
-Have you eaten? Let's go for lunch.
-Yes.

209
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,377
Let's go.

210
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,838
Who is this? A new member?

211
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,092
He was just asking for directions.
He was just about to leave.

212
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,803
Don't just leave. Join our club.

213
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,098
No, he says there's another club
he wants to join.

214
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,015
Really?

215
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,684
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

216
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,019
-Shall we?
-Please take over for me.

217
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,604
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

218
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,357
Our clubroom is on the second floor
of the student center.

219
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,068
It's open 24 hours a day,
so drop by whenever you want to join.

220
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,155
No, just go join the club
you were going to. Goodbye.

221
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,656
Let's go.

222
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,640
Look who it is. We meet again.

223
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,852
You know me?

224
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,604
Don't you remember me?

225
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:46,193
During the practical exam,
I sat right next to you, just like this.

226
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,569
You did?

227
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,031
-Nice to meet you. I'm Koo Yeon-jun.
-I'm Oh Chan-yeong.

228
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,370
Hey, you got any plans for tonight?

229
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,539
Tonight? I'm just going to go home.

230
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,209
Why would you just go home?

231
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,960
I've already been making moves.

232
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,130
I met some business school girls
in my elective class.

233
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,841
I set up a three-couple blind date.
Cue the applause.

234
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,430
Sure, I'll let you join. Let's go!

235
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,475
-Oh, I'm good.
-Of course it's good.

236
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,435
I'll do the talking,

237
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,729
so you just need to bring
that face of yours.

238
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,857
I look like a sexy kitten,
so I needed a cute puppy like you.

239
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,485
Actually, I'm a little tired today.

240
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,613
-Let's do it next time.
-Okay, then.

241
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,908
I'm not sure there'll be a next time.
Goodbye, puppy.

242
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,117
Gosh, you're cute.

243
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,412
Who else should I…

244
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,081
A sloth!

245
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,794
Wait.

246
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,546
Business school?

247
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,756
Oh Chan-yeong.

248
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,966
Hey! Oh Chan-yeong!

249
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,437
So, you're an art major?

250
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,231
Why? Do we look that sculpted?

251
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,275
-You're all business majors?
-Yeah.

252
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,194
Do you know
an upperclassman named Han Jun-hee?

253
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,114
Han Jun-hee? I'm not too sure.

254
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,907
It's our first day today.

255
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,118
We still don't know who's who.

256
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,119
Oh, really?

257
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,955
Who exactly is Han Jun-hee?

258
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,167
Hello. Can I help you with your order?

259
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:30,922
What the hell?

260
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,424
What?

261
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,386
What could this be?

262
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,556
Who is this?

263
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,437
You guys must be from our school.
Are you all freshmen?

264
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,688
Yes, in the business school.

265
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,733
Oh, the business school?
I'm also a business major.

266
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,652
You must all be friends.

267
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,446
No, it's our first time meeting them.

268
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,364
They wanted to have a group date.

269
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,326
A group date?

270
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,745
Oh, it's not what you think.

271
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,707
It's good to go on group dates.
You should enjoy your college life.

272
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,210
But it'd be good for you girls
to be wary of the male students.

273
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,131
Especially someone who throws himself
at a woman he only just met.

274
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,261
I told you, it's not like that. Okay?

275
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,930
So, what would you like to order?

276
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,185
Female customers usually enjoy Set A or B.

277
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,270
As for guys…

278
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,149
At first, things were going so well.

279
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,610
But that older student, huh?

280
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:37,364
When she called you out
on your eagerness and determination,

281
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,240
those girls were giving us dirty looks.

282
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,660
Hey.

283
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,954
You were the one who spoiled this, okay?

284
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,665
Hey, okay. It's all my fault.

285
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,999
Could you please move?

286
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,796
What?

287
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,173
Are you waiting for her now?

288
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,219
-To clear up any misunderstanding.
-Didn't look like she wanted to.

289
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,138
I've been waiting so long to meet her.

290
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,224
I can't leave it like this.

291
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,518
You already knew each other?

292
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,860
-I'm so hungry.
-How about some tteokbokki?

293
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,445
I'm meeting Do-hyeon to--

294
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,490
-Jun-hee.
-Do-hyeon.

295
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,492
Well done, everyone.

296
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,202
-Off you go.
-See you.

297
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,621
What now?
It looks like you'll have to give up.

298
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,957
She's got a boyfriend.

299
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,627
I'm off.

300
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,347
I was so hungry. I feel better now.

301
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,685
-I told you to pick something nicer.
-This is enough.

302
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,272
Could we get one more serving of sundae?

303
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,481
-Okay.
-Eat well.

304
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,442
Do you want some broth?

305
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,868
I mean, how can she have a boyfriend?

306
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,291
Didn't Jun-hee tell you
she had a boyfriend

307
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,918
before she dated Koo Yeon-jun?

308
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,879
She never mentioned it.

309
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,298
The whole time,
she only mentioned Koo Yeon-jun.

310
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,675
Han Jun-hee.

311
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,844
How could you do this to me?

312
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,263
But

313
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,099
technically,

314
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,935
Jun-hee doesn't know who you are yet.

315
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,687
She doesn't.

316
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,732
Jun-hee doesn't know who I am.

317
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,706
I only realized it today.

318
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,878
How Jun-hee must've felt when she saw me
after waking up at the hospital.

319
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,844
And how lonely she must've felt back then.

320
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,140
While preparing
for the college entrance exam,

321
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,978
I simply thought
I just had to meet Jun-hee again.

322
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,564
I thought Jun-hee would recognize me,

323
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,275
and we'd end up falling in love again.

324
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,197
Like a fool, I believed that.

325
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,327
I only managed to get by all this time
'cause of my memories with Jun-hee.

326
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:36,793
But those memories
don't exist for Jun-hee.

327
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,380
Everything that happened between us…

328
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,802
all seems meaningless now.

329
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,096
That's not true.

330
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,850
You two are extraordinarily intertwined.

331
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,813
I'm sure there must be a way for you
to become close to Jun-hee again.

332
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,357
Do you think so?

333
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,947
Yeon-jun cared for me from the beginning.

334
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,658
At first, he kept some distance

335
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,578
and never pressured me
just because he liked me.

336
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,290
But he was still there for me
when I was going through a hard time.

337
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,459
You said he kept his distance.
How did you get close?

338
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,587
Our paths kept crossing,

339
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,841
so I kept bumping into him
wherever I went.

340
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,930
We ran into each other in lectures,
and we even had the same part-time job.

341
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,851
Just like that, we slowly,
yet gradually, got to know each other.

342
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,603
Sir.

343
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,314
I think I know.

344
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,276
I think Jun-hee already gave me
all the clues.

345
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,363
I need to go, sir.

346
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,161
What shall we eat later?

347
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,913
-Rabbokki.
-Okay.

348
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,338
What are you doing? You're an art major.
This is a business class.

349
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,341
It's open to students of other majors.

350
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,428
And I'm still a freshman,
so I wanted to try different subjects.

351
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,222
Do you expect me to believe that?

352
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,518
Whether you believe me or not,
everyone is free to take this class.

353
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,480
Hey, why are you still
speaking casually to me?

354
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,482
You told me not to call you by your name,

355
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,734
but I don't think you told me
not to speak casually.

356
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,652
Am I wrong?

357
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,238
Either way, you…

358
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,615
-Who's this?
-Huh?

359
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,620
My name is Koo Yeon-jun.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

360
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,622
How nice and polite you are, Yeon-jun.

361
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,124
I am Oh Chan-yeong, a freshman.

362
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,459
Nice to meet you.

363
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,503
They're both nice and tall.

364
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,504
-Let's go sit.
-What?

365
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,130
-Take your seat. What?
-Let's go.

366
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,549
-Let's talk some more.
-Just sit.

367
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,926
But-- Take a seat.

368
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,059
Hello.

369
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,478
-Jun-hee.
-Oh, hello, sir.

370
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,731
Say hello. This is Koo Yeon-jun.
He'll be working with us starting today.

371
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,532
Why do you come all the way
to Cheongdam-dong to work?

372
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,786
Well, I was looking for a part-time job,

373
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,080
and Na-eun told me about this place.

374
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,332
Do you expect me to believe that?

375
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,960
You're here because of me.

376
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,212
Am I wrong?

377
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,798
You're right.

378
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,344
Are you uncomfortable
with me working here?

379
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,346
Yes.

380
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,558
Then, should I quit?

381
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,356
No, there's no need for that.

382
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,820
This job is harder than it looks,
so lots of people quit within a week.

383
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,740
I think you underestimated this job
when you started it,

384
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,993
but I'm certain
you'll want to quit in three days.

385
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,540
So, are you saying I should work here?

386
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,167
Yes.

387
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,586
Give it your best shot.

388
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,779
Lee Jun-woo, what have you done now?

389
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,489
It's fine.

390
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,325
-Shouldn't you let him have it?
-Stop crying.

391
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,284
Are you okay?

392
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,912
Let me clean it up for you.

393
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,206
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

394
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,791
-Do your job properly.
-I'm sorry.

395
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,376
This was really expensive.
What are you going to do now?

396
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,628
She just bought it today!

397
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,588
It's okay.

398
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,965
Honey, I'm taking your side now.

399
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,634
-I'm terribly sorry.
-It's okay.

400
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,261
It's fine. Everyone makes mistakes.

401
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,975
Yeah, Yeon-jun got into
the same college as Han Jun-hee

402
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,560
and has even met her.

403
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,271
Everything is happening, as you said.

404
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:10,983
Yeah.

405
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,402
There's nothing to worry about yet.

406
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,029
I understand.

407
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,616
Thank you, sir.

408
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,817
YEAR 2006

409
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,820
Hey, you came.

410
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,866
It's cold. You didn't have to.

411
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,566
It's been a while.

412
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,998
Your grandma closed down the snack bar
and is waiting for you.

413
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,585
She's old.

414
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,755
She should've closed it down
a long time ago.

415
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,090
But because of me…

416
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,346
She's been holding on,
just waiting for the day you come back.

417
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,269
She was able to stay strong
because she had you.

418
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,832
Grandma.

419
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,462
In-gyu.

420
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,550
In-gyu.

421
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,181
I'm so sorry.

422
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,184
No, don't be sorry.

423
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,020
You're here now. That's all that matters.

424
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,356
Everything is fine now.

425
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,277
Goodness, my poor baby.

426
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,906
My poor baby.

427
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,233
Where's your grandma?

428
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,485
She's sleeping.

429
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,226
It's our first time having a drink, right?

430
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,619
I was in a serious accident
a few years ago.

431
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,204
I was in a coma

432
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,664
for a few weeks.

433
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,252
When I finally woke up,
my leg was like this.

434
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,633
I mean, the doctor said
that I was lucky to be alive.

435
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,512
I got a job here

436
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,016
and dropped by
to see your grandma from time to time.

437
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,228
I guess you could say

438
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,688
I'm living a normal life now.

439
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,782
Why are you talking like nothing happened?

440
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,163
I killed Kwon Min-ju.

441
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,042
How can you act like nothing happened?

442
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,128
You must despise me.

443
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,132
I don't despise you.

444
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,843
I've never despised you.

445
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,344
You don't despise me?

446
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,807
But you liked Kwon Min-ju too.

447
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,145
Because I know…

448
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,481
you didn't kill Min-ju.

449
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,360
I know you would never have done that.

450
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,738
No matter what others say…

451
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:52,783
I know.

452
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,119
How can you say that
after seeing it yourself?

453
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,874
You just don't want to believe it.

454
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,707
NOKSAN MURDER INVESTIGATION CONTINUES

455
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,542
A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF MURDER SUSPECT

456
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,515
I'LL STOP IN-GYU'S DEATH NO MATTER WHAT

457
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,367
So to get to the apartment,

458
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,328
go straight down that way, turn left,

459
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,622
and when you see a small alley
on the right--

460
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,041
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

461
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,751
I'll just take you there myself.

462
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,587
Really? But I feel so bad.
You must be busy.

463
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,256
Don't worry. Let me carry that.

464
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,549
Gosh, you don't have to.

465
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,509
No, it's okay. It's not heavy at all.

466
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,178
-Let's go.
-Okay.

467
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,683
Are you visiting your kid?

468
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,810
Yes. My son.

469
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,397
Gosh, I don't understand

470
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,026
why all the apartments these days
have difficult names to understand.

471
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,320
I get confused every time I visit Seoul.

472
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,824
Tell me about it.
They should give apartments simple names.

473
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,741
Yeah.

474
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:03,622
Oh my. You're so tall and handsome.

475
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,083
You remind me of my grandson.

476
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,879
Actually, seeing you
reminds me of my friend's grandmother.

477
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,427
-Jun-hee.
-Yeah, Do-hyeon.

478
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,928
We've got a new club member.

479
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,847
-Really?
-Come in.

480
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,765
Come on in.

481
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,475
Remember this guy?

482
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,103
Actually, I have to visit
the student lounge.

483
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,938
Could you please
take his application form?

484
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,440
Thanks.

485
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,233
See you later.

486
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,200
So, what happened was…

487
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,995
Obviously, you aren't here to see me.

488
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,539
But you're here
to look for a club to join, right?

489
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,374
Actually, I'm here for you.

490
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,209
Hey!

491
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,211
But if you're uncomfortable, I'll go.

492
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,381
Should I go?

493
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,218
Forget it.
Just fill out the application form.

494
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,428
Really?

495
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,197
Yeon-jun?

496
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,659
Yes?

497
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,578
When you're done looking at my face,

498
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,373
why don't you fill out the form?

499
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,042
Oh, yeah.

500
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,044
Sure.

501
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,801
Don't openly stare at me like that.

502
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,679
Do-hyeon might get the wrong idea.

503
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,017
You shouldn't look so pretty, then.

504
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,206
Damn, she's at it again.

505
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,542
Huh? What's wrong?

506
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,087
It's my friend. She's going berserk
after breaking up with her boyfriend.

507
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,090
"I can't stop crying,
and I'm about to die, so come right now."

508
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,383
What's wrong with her?

509
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,343
Shouldn't you still go see her?

510
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,387
Forget it. She's always like this.

511
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,765
And have you ever seen anyone
actually die over a break-up?

512
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,101
She's just being dramatic.

513
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,145
I'm sick of her being like this.

514
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,774
Maybe she's not being dramatic.

515
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,614
She might be sending a signal
'cause she's really having a tough time.

516
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,409
You don't know her.
She's always like this.

517
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,994
She's still your friend.

518
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,456
What if she was sending a signal
because she was really suffering,

519
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,417
and you saw it but still missed it…

520
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,462
and ended up

521
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,381
losing your friend forever?

522
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,514
Just go listen and support her.

523
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,601
She really is having a hard time anyway.

524
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
What about In-gyu?

525
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,083
What happened to In-gyu?

526
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,212
Oh, In-gyu.

527
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,758
He was sentenced to nine years
and has been serving it.

528
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,010
If he completes his sentence,
he should be out

529
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,265
in 2007, so this year, maybe even sooner.

530
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,851
Haven't you heard anything?

531
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,062
Last year,

532
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,481
he got out on parole.

533
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,485
Then do you know where he is now?

534
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,153
In-gyu…

535
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:11,745
Sir.

536
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,584
In-gyu…

537
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,713
shortly after he was released,

538
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,299
killed himself.

539
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,263
In the exact same place Min-ju died.

540
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,665
The manager told us
to wipe the dishes with dry cloths.

541
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,293
I'll do it. You should go home.

542
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,169
Let's do it together.

543
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,338
That way, we can finish sooner.

544
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,388
My family runs a dry cleaning business,

545
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,516
and it was really tough last year.

546
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,727
There was even talk
about closing down the business.

547
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,271
And my mom and dad argued a lot.

548
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,025
In the middle of that, my dad collapsed.

549
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,944
My mom blamed herself a lot afterward.

550
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:30,198
She said she should've been nicer,
and it was her fault my dad collapsed.

551
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,744
When something bad happens
to the ones we love,

552
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,788
the rest of us end up blaming ourselves.

553
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,833
Just like my mom did.

554
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,171
But I hope you don't do that, Yeon-jun.

555
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,175
If you remember that friend
and have a hard time, just tell me.

556
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,927
I'll be there to listen.

557
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,065
Is your father okay now?

558
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,609
Of course. He's perfectly fine now.

559
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,946
He's still energetic enough
to exercise early in the morning,

560
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,574
and he still enjoys bickering with my mom
while running the dry cleaning business.

561
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,453
Oh, sorry.

562
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,918
Hey, I almost fell off.

563
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,009
Jun-hee, I heard it's your birthday today.

564
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,720
Aren't you having a birthday party?

565
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,556
Hey, Oh Chan-yeong. What the hell?
You almost gave me a heart attack.

566
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,767
We should have one after school.

567
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,602
Do you guys want to come?

568
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,646
Can we come too?

569
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,732
What? Let them.

570
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,320
Hello?

571
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,363
Yes, sir.

572
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,367
Oh, today? Well, today is…

573
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,621
Never mind. I'll be there.

574
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,039
Bye.

575
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,670
I don't think
I can have a birthday party today.

576
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,963
Why not?

577
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,924
He asked me to work
because there's a group booking.

578
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,384
But today's your day off.

579
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,261
Why didn't you say you couldn't go?

580
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,262
How could I?

581
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,306
He's been putting up with Do-hyeon
leaving early recently.

582
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,850
What a virtuous woman you are.

583
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,771
Come on. Why do you always cover
for Do-hyeon's negligence?

584
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,065
I'll go.

585
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,947
I'll work instead.
Go to your birthday party.

586
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,533
What's going on?

587
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,494
You definitely said
you had something to do later.

588
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,331
How can I ask you to work
so I can have fun?

589
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,791
It's okay. Do your thing.

590
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,793
It's fine. It's nothing urgent.

591
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,547
But if I ever have something urgent,
you'll cover for me, okay?

592
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:55,844
Are you sure it's okay?

593
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,012
It's fine.

594
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,849
I have to get to class. See you later.

595
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,852
No class for me, but I'm off too.

596
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,692
Thank you, Yeon-jun.

597
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,742
For two people, I'd recommend Set B.

598
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,786
And you can also change the side dish.

599
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,412
-Hey, is Set B okay?
-Yeah.

600
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,122
We'll have Set B, then.

601
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,208
-Side dish?
-Just the one on the menu.

602
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,501
We'll have Set B.

603
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,464
-So, you'll have Set B?
-Yes.

604
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,841
Thank you.
I'll be right back with some water.

605
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,759
Thanks.

606
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,225
What are you doing here?

607
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,354
Something came up for Do-hyeon,
so I just had dinner with my friends.

608
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,355
Something came up?

609
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,233
What's more important
than his girlfriend's birthday?

610
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,528
-Oh, you came.
-Yes.

611
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,279
Great. Please go and take orders.

612
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,406
Let's talk later.

613
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,916
One, two, three, four.

614
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,877
We'd like to celebrate

615
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,588
Your birthday

616
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,050
And we are really

617
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,636
All so happy

618
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:25,851
On your beautiful birthday

619
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:30,772
You look so happy

620
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,107
Thank you for coming.

621
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,833
What are you gonna do now?
You're going home, right?

622
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:54,004
Yeah. Now that I'm done with work,
I should go home and work on assignments.

623
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,755
Can you wait here for a bit?

624
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,340
I just need to go out for a bit.

625
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,550
I'll be right back.

626
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,644
Sir!

627
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:11,938
Sir.

628
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,065
Are you closing now?

629
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,233
I'm done for the day.

630
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,486
Sir, I just need one thing.

631
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,384
Oh, Yeon-jun.

632
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,848
Jun-hee said she had to leave first
and asked me to tell you that she's sorry.

633
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,849
She left?

634
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,478
She got a call from her boyfriend
and rushed out just now.

635
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,272
Her boyfriend.

636
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,691
You should go home now too.

637
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,609
Right.

638
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,297
Hi, Do-hyeon.

639
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,595
Who is this?

640
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,848
Have a seat first.

641
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,102
I asked who this was.
I should know before I can join.

642
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,230
Well, this is…

643
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,148
Tell her.

644
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,067
You agreed to tell her today.

645
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,446
Well, this is my ex-girlfriend.

646
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,077
We argued and broke up
in the heat of the moment,

647
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,331
but the more I thought about it,
the more I felt bad about a lot of things.

648
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,792
So, how should I put it?

649
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,628
It was always in the back of my mind.

650
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,802
So you were cheating on me.

651
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,721
Right?

652
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,682
The reason you were on your phone
when we were together

653
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,976
and why you made excuses
to leave work early

654
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,312
was so you could cheat on me, right?

655
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,106
Jun-hee.

656
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,525
Like an idiot, I had no idea.

657
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,280
Dragging it out seemed unfair to you,
so I called you here to end--

658
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,032
How dare you slap him?!

659
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:30,118
Hey, if you're here to watch,
just shut up and watch.

660
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,411
What?

661
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,621
You've done everything you wanted.

662
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:38,084
You already stabbed me in the back,
so why are you pretending like you care?

663
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,296
Thanks a lot
for making my birthday so memorable!

664
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,547
Jun-hee--

665
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,799
Forget it. I never want to see you again.

666
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,385
Wherever it is at school,
stay out of my sight.

667
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,137
Hey!

668
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,703
Huh? My wallet.

669
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,598
Hello?

670
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,141
Hey.

671
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,102
Yeah.

672
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,647
Come to think of it,
I didn't even wish you a happy birthday.

673
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,025
So I wanted to tell you
before the day was over.

674
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,027
Happy birthday.

675
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,446
Thank you.

676
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,741
Oh, you're with Do-hyeon right now, right?

677
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,742
I'll hang up now.

678
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,953
Wait. Well…

679
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,040
Why did you ask me to wait back at work?

680
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,377
Oh, it was nothing.

681
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,004
Did you blow out some candles?

682
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,008
-No, not yet.
-What?

683
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,177
What do you mean? It's your birthday.

684
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,055
A wish made after midnight
won't come true.

685
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,690
You know,

686
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,112
I actually thought long and hard
about whether I should call you or not.

687
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,532
Still, I wanted to hear your voice
while wishing you a happy birthday.

688
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,202
I'll hang up now.

689
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,372
Wish me a happy birthday to my face.

690
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,670
Silly.

691
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,424
Did you run out before
to get me a birthday cake?

692
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,635
Why did you come back here?

693
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,762
Didn't you go to meet Do-hyeon?

694
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,017
The candle is going to melt
all over the cake.

695
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,606
Make your wish
and blow out the candle first.

696
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,295
I made a wish.

697
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,297
You make one too.

698
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,883
What? But it's not even my birthday.

699
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:35,136
It's my birthday,
so you should do as I say.

700
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,145
My wish

701
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,065
already came true.

702
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,945
You're here with me now.

703
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:10,351
