1
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,129
Min-ju, why didn't you wake me up?

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,474
Why the long face?

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,602
What about it?

4
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,189
Well, it's like you're back
to how you were before.

5
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,735
What was I like before?

6
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,195
You really don't know?

7
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,247
Min-ju.

8
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,273
-Hi.
-Min-ju.

9
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,320
Did you hear SechsKies on the radio?
They were so adorable.

10
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,697
-I told you H.O.T. is better.
-You are so clueless.

11
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,032
Min-ju.

12
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,786
Min-ju, is something wrong?

13
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,539
-You don't look so good.
-Huh?

14
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,125
Yeah, you seem like the old Min-ju today.

15
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,210
The old Min-ju?

16
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,588
What was the old Kwon Min-ju like?

17
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,549
Was I unpleasant?

18
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,802
I wouldn't say that you were unpleasant.

19
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,096
Well, it took us some time
to become friends.

20
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,182
Even if we tried to talk to you,
you always kept to yourself.

21
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,976
It felt like you didn't want
anyone near you.

22
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,146
Yeah. You didn't seem like
the type to chit-chat either.

23
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,274
But we really like your new personality,

24
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,110
so you can't go back
to being the old Kwon Min-ju.

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,822
Okay.

26
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,993
Take your seats.

27
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,912
Why aren't you getting ready for class?

28
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,253
Yeah.

29
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,715
I really despise the old Kwon Min-ju too.

30
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,180
I wish someone would…

31
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,561
accept me for who I am
instead of treating me like a weirdo!

32
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,802
A TIME CALLED YOU

33
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,681
Aristotle said that
in order for humans to be happy,

34
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,934
they should find the golden mean.

35
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,603
So, what is the golden mean? Huh?

36
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,065
It's about not being excessive or limited
but just the right--

37
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,157
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,034
Where have you been?

39
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,578
Sit down.

40
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,251
For example, like Nam Si-heon over there,

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,212
if you're overly courageous,
you become reckless.

42
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,549
And if you lack courage,
then you become a coward.

43
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,594
-Does everyone get what I mean?
-Yes, sir.

44
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,598
Now, this notion of a golden mean
wasn't just in the West.

45
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,559
Someone also preached it in the East.

46
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,727
Does anyone know who?

47
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,362
Si-heon.

48
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,781
Nam Si-heon.

49
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,179
Nam Si-heon.

50
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,605
Kwon Min-ju.

51
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,109
I want to ask you a favor.

52
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,446
From now on, please don't look at me

53
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,073
like Jun-hee would.

54
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,889
You were expressionless
as if you'd vanished into a dark cave.

55
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,933
You had no energy and were always sulking.

56
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,477
I was finally getting used to the new you.

57
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,187
Don't go back to your old self.

58
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,024
Min-ju, is something wrong?

59
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,026
You seem like the old Min-ju today.

60
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,529
I wouldn't say that you were unpleasant.

61
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,572
It took us some time to become friends.

62
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,242
So you can't go back
to being the old Kwon Min-ju.

63
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,911
Han Jun-hee.

64
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,956
You're watching it all
from there, aren't you?

65
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,045
I used to be a kid
who only heard things like that.

66
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,756
You probably can't even imagine

67
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,009
what other kids used to whisper…

68
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,763
behind my back.

69
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,162
Min-ju. Don't do it.

70
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,289
It's all my fault.

71
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,333
You were struggling, but I kept urging you
to speak about Oh Chan-yeong.

72
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm sorry that I came into your body
and made things hard for you.

73
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
I'm so sorry, Min-ju.

74
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,676
Why are you apologizing to me?

75
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,597
You didn't do anything wrong.

76
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,351
I should be thanking you instead.

77
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,229
Thanks to you coming into my body,

78
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,607
even though it was for a short while,

79
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,609
I was popular,

80
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,905
and I got to live and be loved
as Han Jun-hee.

81
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,114
-Hi, Min-ju.
-Is it okay?

82
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,157
They all look great.

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,117
You bring joy to my life!

84
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,577
Let's go.

85
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,495
But…

86
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,829
Nam Si-heon, go faster.

87
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,123
…after waking up from a lovely dream…

88
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,296
I think it hurts even more.

89
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,383
Han Jun-hee, you know what?

90
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,136
If I kill myself,

91
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,306
the other kids will probably say,

92
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,851
"Oh, I feel sorry for Kwon Min-ju."

93
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,979
"But I knew she'd end up doing that."

94
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,149
"How pathetic."

95
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,112
They'll probably talk like that
for a day or two

96
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,281
and then gradually forget about me.

97
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,037
As if I never existed in the first place,

98
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,706
they'll get on with their lives.

99
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,209
But, Han Jun-hee,

100
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,296
there's one thing I learned thanks to you.

101
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,051
If it turns out, as you know,

102
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,762
that today,

103
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,932
on October 13,

104
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,185
1998…

105
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,731
I am murdered by someone,

106
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,860
I won't be forgotten so easily.

107
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,864
And they won't say that I'm pathetic.

108
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,533
No.

109
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,202
They won't be able to.

110
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,833
Min-ju. What are you saying right now?

111
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,757
I wasn't the one who killed Kwon Min-ju.

112
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,136
It was you, Han Jun-hee.

113
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,388
This is what he meant.

114
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,559
I was the one who started all of this.

115
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,061
It wasn't Oh Chan-yeong.

116
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,105
Because of me, Min-ju…

117
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,400
Because of me, Min-ju…

118
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,784
Because it'll be a controversial murder,

119
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,828
they will talk about me for ages.

120
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,541
You know, in the newspapers or on TV,

121
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,628
murder victims

122
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,049
are always portrayed
as having lived very fulfilling lives,

123
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,552
saying it's such a waste for them
to die like this.

124
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,598
So…

125
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,270
maybe that's how they'll remember me too.

126
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,741
For me…

127
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,161
perhaps

128
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,373
it's only after death…

129
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,627
that I could become

130
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,421
the Kwon Min-ju I yearned to be.

131
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,843
"For me, perhaps it's only after death

132
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,346
that I could become

133
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,973
the Kwon Min-ju I yearned to be."

134
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,854
What is it?

135
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,318
Is something wrong?

136
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,029
I saw Min-ju talking
on the rooftop earlier.

137
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,698
I read her lips, and it seemed like
she was talking to someone

138
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,950
while repeatedly saying, "Han Jun-hee."

139
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,415
What did she say exactly?

140
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,251
She was far away,
so I couldn't catch it all.

141
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,295
But what she said was,

142
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,924
"Thanks to you coming into my body,

143
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,801
even though it was for a short while,

144
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,302
I was popular,

145
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,222
and I got to live and be loved
as Han Jun-hee."

146
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,432
But that wasn't all.

147
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,560
She said if she were murdered
by someone today,

148
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,604
people wouldn't see her as pathetic

149
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,482
but would always remember and miss her.

150
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,527
Do you remember?

151
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,029
Min-ju told us about a murder before.

152
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,156
A murder?

153
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,245
I heard that someone
would murder Kwon Min-ju

154
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,913
on October 13, 1998.

155
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,082
Today is October 13.

156
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,876
Where is Min-ju right now?

157
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,546
I don't know.
She left her bag and went somewhere.

158
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,425
First, let's hurry and search
the places she could've gone.

159
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,635
I'll go to her house.

160
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,428
Okay, I'll go to the record store.

161
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,313
Kwon Min-ju.

162
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,649
Kwon Min-ju!

163
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,744
Here you are.

164
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,918
Have you seen Min-ju?
Didn't she come here?

165
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:38,919
No, she didn't.

166
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,005
Why? What's going on?

167
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,882
If she comes in, please page me.

168
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,719
And make sure she doesn't go anywhere
until Si-heon and I get here. Please.

169
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,374
Do you remember this place?

170
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,503
You were found lying here
after hurting your head.

171
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,632
Min-ju, are you…

172
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,969
Please don't do this.

173
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,348
Getting murdered won't change things
the way you want them to.

174
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,898
Min-ju, please don't. Please.

175
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,449
Min-ju, it's not too late to run away.

176
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,079
Min-ju. Please run away. Okay?

177
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,882
What are you going to do to me?

178
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,192
I will make sure that

179
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,696
everyone in the world remembers you
at your most beautiful.

180
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,284
Rather than living
a long, meaningless life,

181
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,537
if you could end things forever

182
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,540
when you're at your most beautiful…

183
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,505
isn't that way better?

184
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,890
What is that?

185
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,356
It's something I always carry with me,
just for you.

186
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,400
You could say

187
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,736
it's a magic potion

188
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,864
to send you to heaven.

189
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,533
If you inject me with that,

190
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,745
will it hurt a lot?

191
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,957
Well, it's going to be a little painful.

192
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,044
But it won't take too long.

193
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,546
I promise.

194
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,726
Oh, Min-ju.

195
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,285
Oh Chan-yeong.

196
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,457
No.

197
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,501
Oh Chan-yeong!

198
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,545
Damn it! No!

199
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
Hey.

200
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,615
No.

201
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,993
This isn't right.

202
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,871
Min-ju.

203
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,832
This wasn't me.

204
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,136
Hey, what are you doing? Stand up.

205
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,597
You promised you'd kill me!

206
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,514
No.

207
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,224
No, I don't want to!

208
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,774
That wasn't me.

209
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,612
It wasn't me!

210
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,627
Min-ju. Okay, that's good.

211
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,921
You won't die anymore.

212
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,131
You're going to live.

213
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,227
Min-ju. Wait a minute, Min-ju.

214
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,561
Wait, hear me out.

215
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,231
Okay, I'll go back to my world.

216
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,483
I won't ever come into your body again.

217
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,194
No matter what happens in the future,

218
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,072
I'll never interfere in your life again.

219
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,325
So please don't do this to yourself. Okay?

220
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm the one you should hate and curse at.

221
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,830
Not yourself.

222
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,623
Han Jun-hee.

223
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:34,876
I…

224
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,840
don't hate you.

225
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,803
I…

226
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,601
I just…

227
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,772
I just hate myself the most.

228
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,861
I am…

229
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,324
someone whose life is not worth living.

230
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,992
No.

231
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,204
Min-ju.

232
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,011
In-gyu.

233
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,060
What are you doing?

234
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,861
In-gyu.

235
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,238
Help me.

236
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,867
Remember how you said

237
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,244
you knew exactly how I felt?

238
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,330
So help me.

239
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:54,956
Okay?

240
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,126
Right now, right here,

241
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,545
please kill me.

242
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,381
Won't you?

243
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,216
Please, In-gyu.

244
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,844
Please.

245
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,640
If I don't get murdered today,

246
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,768
everything will go back to how it was.

247
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,437
I'll have to go back

248
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,232
to living Kwon Min-ju's pathetic life.

249
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,567
Please? In-gyu.

250
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:23,985
Min-ju.

251
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,863
Calm down first, and listen to me.

252
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,824
I know you're suffering a lot.

253
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,367
But you're not alone.

254
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,871
There are many of us that care about you.

255
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,374
There is no one like that.

256
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,212
No one is by my side.

257
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,130
Si-heon.

258
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,881
You have Si-heon and In-gyu.

259
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,677
And right now,
I'm doing all this to save you.

260
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,595
I give you my word.

261
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,723
I'll take responsibility
and turn everything back to how it was.

262
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,142
What I'm saying is that

263
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,769
I'll send you back
to where you were before I intervened.

264
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,687
So…

265
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,940
so just give yourself another chance.

266
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,944
Min-ju, if you believe in me
and just hang in there a little longer--

267
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:06,862
Han Jun-hee.

268
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,742
In the end…

269
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,246
is that all you have to say?

270
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:19,916
"Hang in there"?

271
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,710
Han Jun-hee.

272
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,045
"Hang in there"?

273
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,799
You…

274
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,053
you made friends without even trying…

275
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,766
and Si-heon liked you.

276
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,145
So, how can you know what I'm feeling?

277
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,898
How do you know what I'm feeling?

278
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,610
You think I ended up like this
because I didn't try hard enough?

279
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,571
Oh, Min-ju.

280
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,533
I… I am…

281
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,953
I am just totally and utterly alone.

282
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,999
Nobody…

283
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,295
nobody knows how much I am suffering.

284
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,050
No.

285
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,760
I know.

286
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,805
I know only too well
how you've been getting through this.

287
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,809
But, Min-ju,
there's something you don't know.

288
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,020
I…

289
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,441
I really like you a lot.

290
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,487
My heart broke
every time you looked at Si-heon.

291
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,697
But if it made you happy,

292
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,700
I thought that I should bear it.

293
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,954
Min-ju.

294
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,958
Give me a chance.

295
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,211
Then this time,

296
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,339
I'll show you just how much I like you.

297
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,094
Every day, I'll show you
how it feels to be loved by someone.

298
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:56,763
So,

299
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,184
please give that to me.

300
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,061
Please.

301
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,729
You like me?

302
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,857
Don't come closer.

303
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,987
In-gyu.

304
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,490
You don't like me.

305
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,659
You think I'm similar to you…

306
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,496
so you are pitying me.

307
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,290
It's not like that.

308
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,333
Other people tell me,

309
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,545
"Min-ju, what's up with your expression?"

310
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,132
"Min-ju, you should smile more."

311
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,260
"Min-ju, you can't go back
to being the old Kwon Min-ju."

312
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,012
"Min-ju."

313
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,346
Please.

314
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,183
Please stop.

315
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,771
What can I do to make you believe me?

316
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,691
I liked you just the way you were.

317
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,943
I wouldn't have cared
if you hadn't changed.

318
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,530
In-gyu.

319
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,409
It's so suffocating.

320
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,458
This life has been just so awful.

321
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:11,671
Someone like me should've never been born
in the first place.

322
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,589
You're wrong.

323
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,050
You are very precious to me.

324
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,386
I've been listening to you all along.

325
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,933
I want to wake up from this nightmare.

326
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,353
No. Don't do it.

327
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,313
Min-ju, please don't.

328
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,148
It's time

329
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,151
to wake up from this dream.

330
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,779
No!

331
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,947
No!

332
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,155
You were dazzling.

333
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,033
Nice! Hey, you're pretty good!

334
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,535
Block him! Block Si-heon!

335
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,496
Nice.

336
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,497
You

337
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,252
dazzled me so much that my eyes were sore.

338
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,216
I wanted to reach you just for a moment.

339
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,971
Even just for the briefest of moments.

340
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,183
It would've been nice,
even for just a little while.

341
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,825
Oh no.

342
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,376
No, Min-ju.

343
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,560
Min-ju. Look at me.

344
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:38,902
Min-ju!

345
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,122
Kwon Min-ju!

346
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,041
Kwon Min--

347
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,278
What's wrong with Min-ju?

348
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,241
I'm asking you why Min-ju is like this.

349
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,578
Hey, Jung In-gyu.

350
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,666
Say something. Why is she like this?

351
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,128
Min-ju

352
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,756
is at peace now.

353
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,306
I did it.

354
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,770
What do you mean by that?

355
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,399
I killed Min-ju.

356
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,859
What are you talking about?

357
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,319
I did it.

358
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,489
Don't lie. Why would you kill Min-ju?

359
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,283
Why would you kill her?

360
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,584
Nam Si-heon.

361
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,212
I killed her.

362
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,190
There's no going back.

363
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,902
Because of me…

364
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,864
Min-ju died because of me.

365
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,491
I want to undo it all,

366
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,536
but the cassette player broke,

367
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,331
so I can't go back anymore.

368
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,751
Si-heon.

369
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:45,880
Is this…

370
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,634
how everything ends?

371
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,026
I tried, but I couldn't get it to work.

372
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,446
I somehow got the parts back together,
but it won't play.

373
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,743
I took the chewed-up tape out
and wound it back up.

374
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,374
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

375
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,336
"Whenever your heart calls me."

376
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,422
What does it mean?

377
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,517
"I will come to you."

378
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,229
Si-heon.

379
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,109
Please.

380
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,697
Please, just one more time…

381
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,537
let me go back to your time.

382
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,452
When the lights outside the window

383
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,541
Start dimming one by one

384
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,588
I write a letter to the sky

385
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,173
You left me…

386
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,143
No!

387
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,121
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

388
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,045
Thank you, In-gyu.

389
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,714
You saved Min-ju.

390
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,596
Han Jun-hee?

391
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,069
Hey, Kwon Min-ju!

392
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,995
Nam Si-heon.

393
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,156
It's you.

394
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,992
Han Jun-hee.

395
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,287
Isn't it?

396
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,290
You're back, aren't you?

397
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,418
How did you know it was me?

398
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,596
I can just tell.

399
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,191
In the end, this made everything possible.

400
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,985
Oh Chan-yeong of 2023

401
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,654
was able to come to 1998 using this.

402
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,491
Because Oh Chan-yeong
returned to his body in 2023,

403
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,493
his plan to harm Min-ju failed?

404
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,537
That's right.

405
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,290
What was destined to happen today

406
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,625
hasn't happened.

407
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,920
What about Min-ju?

408
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,132
If you're here with us now,

409
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,508
where is Min-ju?

410
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,472
Min-ju is safe and sound.

411
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,266
She'll be back shortly.

412
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,018
When?

413
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,812
After I'm done taking care of some things.

414
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,148
What do you mean?

415
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,317
Since Min-ju has survived,

416
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,695
the future is going to change.

417
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,203
But if the future is going to change…

418
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,042
doesn't that mean
everything else will change too?

419
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,212
You and I won't meet in college.

420
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,838
And if we don't meet then,

421
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,299
you won't come back to now,

422
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,677
and you wouldn't have met me.

423
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:51,972
Right?

424
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,110
To be honest,
I'm not yet sure what's changed.

425
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,947
A lot of things
have started to change already.

426
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,782
I can assure you.

427
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,835
I'll take this with me.

428
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,586
Huh?

429
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,553
Okay.

430
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,271
Uncle!

431
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,273
I'm back!

432
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,483
Hey, you brat.
Where have you been until so late?

433
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,318
I'm sorry.

434
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,820
In-gyu came by, saying weird things.

435
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,698
I called home, but you weren't there.
I've been so worried.

436
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,740
Did something happen?

437
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,410
Everything's fine now.

438
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,413
And it's all thanks to you.

439
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,330
Me?

440
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,458
Did I help?

441
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,293
Of course.

442
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,671
You've done so much to help.

443
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,174
Really?

444
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,888
Min-ju.

445
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,519
I know you're in there,

446
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,396
so you don't need to answer.

447
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,942
Just hear me out for a second.

448
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,153
After everything goes back to how it was,

449
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,199
you might try to turn your back
on the world again.

450
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,243
However,

451
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,704
even if that happens again,

452
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,999
I won't try to stop you.

453
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,128
You were right.

454
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,134
You've been trying more than enough.

455
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,971
You've tried so hard,

456
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,600
so it would be meaningless
to tell you to try harder.

457
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,894
But, Min-ju,

458
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,565
I really want to tell you one thing.

459
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,736
When I was where you are now…

460
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,116
I had a lot of chances
to peek into your heart.

461
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:03,414
You were struggling so much
and wanting to give up…

462
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,877
but it wasn't
because you were weak and depressed.

463
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,339
It was

464
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:18,387
because you were so full of hope
and expectations for the world.

465
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,973
Min-ju.

466
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,269
The truth is that…

467
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,524
because you are so full of hope,

468
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:35,112
you were trying harder
than anyone else in this world.

469
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,581
I'm sorry
for misunderstanding you so much.

470
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:50,753
It's only now…

471
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,341
that I've finally gotten
to know you a bit better.

472
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,647
Gosh, this darn alarm clock!

473
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,691
Hey, Kwon Do-hun!

474
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,325
Kwon Do-hun.

475
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,371
I won't be able to wake you up anymore.

476
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,584
You're all grown up now.
You have to wake up on your own.

477
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,883
And don't be too harsh to your sister.

478
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,010
Okay?

479
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,054
You're really caring deep inside,

480
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,181
but why do you always act otherwise?

481
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,342
I'm meeting a friend today,
so I'm taking the day off.

482
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,718
Postscript.

483
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,930
Why don't you take a barista class
when you have time?

484
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,351
Later, you'll become a café owner,
but the market will be highly competitive,

485
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,603
so professional skills
are necessary to succeed.

486
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,524
Well, if you don't believe me,
it'll be totally your loss.

487
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,110
What on earth is she talking about
so early in the morning?

488
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,687
Please get rid of all this.

489
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,148
Both of these?

490
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,818
Yeah.

491
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,863
You have to
in order for Min-ju to come back to you.

492
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,614
But

493
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,117
if I get rid of these,

494
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,953
there'll be no way for you
to come back to 1998.

495
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,291
It means you'll never be able
to see Si-heon again.

496
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,585
What are you going to do?

497
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,880
I know Si-heon.

498
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,134
If he can't see you again,

499
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,720
he won't be okay at all.

500
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,434
Once this tape and cassette player
are gone,

501
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,062
Si-heon may forget all about my existence.

502
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,566
Maybe none of it will ever happen
in the first place.

503
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,654
But there's no other way.

504
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,449
It's not just Oh Chan-yeong.

505
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:34,453
If these continue to exist,
I'll be tempted to keep returning to 1998.

506
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,204
However,

507
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,625
I must never get involved
in Min-ju's life again.

508
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,961
So please get rid of it.

509
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,255
Okay?

510
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,559
Si-heon.

511
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,075
Did you wait long?

512
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,161
No.

513
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,793
Let's go.

514
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,305
We're here!

515
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,682
We're at the sea!

516
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,537
Okay.

517
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,433
Hey!

518
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,602
Darn it, come here. Hey, come here.

519
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,107
-Hold it?
-And throw.

520
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,780
That was pretty good.

521
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,121
Today is our…

522
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,249
last day together, right?

523
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,462
Once you leave today…

524
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,634
you can never come back, can you?

525
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,264
To prevent Kwon Min-ju

526
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,684
from meeting Oh Chan-yeong at all…

527
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,604
you're going to destroy that tape.

528
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,402
When did you figure it out?

529
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:41,032
Yesterday, when you said
you'd take the tape and cassette player.

530
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,748
You catch on to things quickly.

531
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,878
I know because it's you.

532
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,590
I know what you're thinking,

533
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,050
even if you don't say anything.

534
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,402
When I miss you so much…

535
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,991
When I miss you so much
that I can't bear it,

536
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,994
what should I do?

537
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:33,919
Si-heon.

538
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,547
This is not the end.

539
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,383
We are not

540
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,678
parting ways forever.

541
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,014
If you are

542
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,141
the Si-heon I think you are,

543
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,102
you will find me, no matter what.

544
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,066
Right?

545
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,488
Yeah.

546
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,328
I promise.

547
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,957
I will surely find you.

548
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,587
It doesn't matter when or where you are.

549
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,432
We will definitely meet again.

550
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,225
I will make sure…

551
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,520
to come and find you.

552
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:55,226
I HOPE THIS MUSIC TAKES YOU
TO YOUR HAPPIEST MOMENT

553
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,329
What am I doing here?

554
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,521
Min-ju.

555
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,777
Are you okay? Let me get the doctor.

556
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,236
Well, actually…

557
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,864
What happened to me?

558
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,158
Don't you remember?

559
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,078
A few days ago, on the day
Si-heon and I threw you a birthday party,

560
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,371
you were in a car accident.

561
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,874
A car accident?

562
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,935
When the lights outside the window

563
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,606
Start dimming one by one

564
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,986
I write a letter to the sky

565
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:44,450
You left me for someone else…

566
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:46,869
What's the matter?

567
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,001
It's nothing.
Something just felt a little weird.

568
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,045
Weird?

569
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,547
This song.

570
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,092
It feels a bit strange to hear this song.

571
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,684
It feels like
I forgot something really important.

572
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:11,936
What could it be?

573
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:16,524
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

574
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:20,236
I'll just continue to love you

575
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:26,075
Dear, I'm going to wait…

576
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,247
Are we not going?

577
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,834
Let's go.

578
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,380
Should I get something for Min-ju?

579
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,841
Gosh, you're talking about
Kwon Min-ju again?

580
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,052
But what should I get her?

581
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,138
Just tell me what we're going to eat.

582
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,183
-How about pork cutlet?
-Not that.

583
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,532
How does it feel to be back at school?

584
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,581
Anything troubling you?

585
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,128
It's not that.

586
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,549
I was thinking about a dream I had before.

587
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:24,967
A dream?

588
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,303
What kind of dream was it?

589
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,681
To tell you the truth,

590
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,893
before my car accident,

591
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,147
I used to think I was really unfortunate.

592
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,566
I thought I was totally alone
in this world.

593
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,362
But I met another me

594
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,490
in my dream.

595
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,952
She told me

596
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,455
the reason I've been struggling

597
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,750
is because I had a lot of expectations
for the world.

598
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,920
And that's why it was so hard.

599
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:09,220
After hearing that,
I cried a lot in my dream.

600
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,307
Then I woke up in the hospital.

601
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,185
Oddly, I felt a lot more at peace.

602
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:22,733
In-gyu.

603
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,612
Perhaps

604
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,116
I was wrong to think

605
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,369
that I was alone.

606
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,539
I think

607
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,293
I didn't take a close look around me

608
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,963
and didn't realize who was there.

609
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:47,925
Now…

610
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,305
can you see who is next to you?

611
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,103
Yeah.

612
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,856
I see it clearly.

613
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:16,329
YEAR 2011

614
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:22,835
RATIO OF WEBTOONS TO PUBLISHED COMICS

615
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,097
Oh, it's freezing.

616
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,183
It looks like the boss already got here.

617
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,312
I don't think he left in the first place.

618
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,229
Again?

619
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,191
Good morning.

620
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,026
-Good morning.
-Hello.

621
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,153
Did you stay up all night working again?

622
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,739
I was just reviewing
some webtoons we received.

623
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,161
Take a look at this. I picked out a few.

624
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,622
I think they're pretty original and good.

625
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,375
Oh, this one.

626
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,834
This is quite fresh,

627
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:07,505
but I thought it might be
a bit too experimental or niche.

628
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,049
I want us to focus more
on this kind of thing.

629
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,717
We are a new platform,

630
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,429
so we need to target the work
that the large portal sites let slip.

631
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,545
Sir, wait!

632
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:34,884
Thank you.

633
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,054
This is our last song for today.

634
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,974
It's dedicated to all the listeners
who are heading home

635
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,351
after wrapping up another hard day.

636
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,855
"Gather My Tears" by Seo Ji-won.

637
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,987
When the lights outside the window

638
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,950
Start dimming one by one

639
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,914
I write a letter to the sky

640
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:10,878
You left me for someone else

641
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:14,632
But I still cannot forget you

642
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:18,302
So I gather my tears

643
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,307
And send them off to the sky

644
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:27,311
Though I'm not your love

645
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,482
If you look for me

646
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:37,905
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

647
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:42,326
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

648
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:46,372
I'll just continue to love you

649
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:52,169
Dear, I'm going to wait

650
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:58,050
When my letter of tears reaches the sky…

651
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,301
Kwon Min-ju?

652
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,054
Sorry?

653
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,601
I'm sorry. You look like someone I know.

654
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,770
Oh, it's no problem.

655
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:21,991
I will believe it and gather my tears…

656
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,005
Excuse me.

657
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,449
I promise.

658
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,244
I will surely find you.

659
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,832
It doesn't matter when or where you are.

660
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,169
We will definitely meet again.

661
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,923
I will come and find you…

662
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,635
in a time called you.

663
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,285
