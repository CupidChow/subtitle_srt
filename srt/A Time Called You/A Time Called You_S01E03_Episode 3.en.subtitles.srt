1
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,065
Where am I?

2
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,461
Hello?

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,797
Hello? Is anyone there?

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,471
Hello?

5
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,724
Oh no.

6
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,104
Hello?

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,398
Hello?

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,443
What am I going to do?

9
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,029
Help me!

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,408
Oh my! What am I going to do?

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,954
Kwon Min-ju, I'm back again.

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,457
Nam Si-heon?

13
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,085
Kwon Min-ju.

14
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,134
Kwon Min-ju!

15
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,385
Are you awake?

16
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,264
Do you recognize me? Do you?

17
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,549
A TIME CALLED YOU

18
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,262
Is it really you, Yeon-jun?

19
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,855
I missed you.

20
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,195
I missed you so much, Yeon-jun.

21
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,411
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,038
I'm so sorry
for arguing with you back then.

23
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,627
I knew how you were feeling…

24
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,924
Where have you been all this time?
I've been waiting for you.

25
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,192
Hey, what's gotten into you, Kwon Min-ju?

26
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,236
Hey, you're here.

27
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,448
Why are you calling me Kwon Min-ju?

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,163
Are you okay, Min-ju?

29
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,207
I've been worried about you.

30
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,338
Why do you keep calling me Min-ju? Huh?

31
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,718
Hello.

32
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,639
…mourn the passing of our
brother in Christ, Andrew Koo Yeon-jun.

33
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,683
Then you should greet me back too.
I'm your friend as well.

34
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,560
Who sent this?

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,979
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

36
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,459
Are you okay, Min-ju?

37
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,880
Jung In-gyu?

38
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,424
That's right. It's me, In-gyu.

39
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,634
How about me?

40
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,885
Do you recognize me?

41
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,352
You're…

42
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,398
I'm Nam Si-heon.
You really don't remember me?

43
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,860
Nam Si-heon.

44
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,369
What's today's date?

45
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,497
June 15th.

46
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,374
2023?

47
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,919
What are you on about?
It's 1998, of course.

48
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,841
1998?

49
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,054
She must've hurt her head badly
in the accident.

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,141
Kwon Min-ju.

51
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,144
What's the last thing you remember?

52
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,939
Do you remember how it happened?

53
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:28,870
I can remember you two celebrating
my birthday with me in front of the shop.

54
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,163
-That's right.
-Yeah.

55
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,665
No, wait.

56
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,253
Yeon-jun.

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,549
It was the first birthday
I spent without him.

58
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,509
What?

59
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,764
No. That's not right either!

60
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,725
Oh, right. Do-hun.

61
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,604
I left home to find my mom,
who had disappeared with Do-hun.

62
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,940
But a car suddenly
came my way really fast.

63
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,193
I was so startled
that I couldn't dodge it.

64
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,529
Yes, that's right.
That's how the accident happened!

65
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,657
Where are Mom and Do-hun now, then?

66
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,831
Hey, what's wrong?

67
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,250
Where's my mom right now?

68
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,921
Your mother?
She said she was gonna drop by your house.

69
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,051
Her daughter was lying unconscious
in the hospital, yet she still went home?

70
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,721
It's obviously because of Do-hun,
that brat!

71
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,684
Do you guys have money for a taxi?

72
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,697
Mom, answer the phone!

73
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,500
I was busy in the kitchen.
Did you have to call for me?

74
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,296
How can you play games
when your sister's in the hospital?

75
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,842
Why, I should just burn your game console!

76
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,260
Try it. I'll run away.

77
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,680
You're such a spoiled little brat.

78
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,102
Why aren't you at the hospital?

79
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,564
I just dropped by to cook Do-hun's dinner.

80
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,483
I told you I'd cook him dinner.

81
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,320
Hurry back to the hospital.
What if something happens to Min-ju?

82
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,490
Is Min-ju really not doing that well?

83
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,452
Your sister is…

84
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,251
Min-ju. When did you wake up?

85
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,253
And how did you get home?

86
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:43,963
Wow.

87
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,550
I mean, don't you think
this is a bit much?

88
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,138
Mom, did you come back home
to cook Do-hun's dinner?

89
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,517
You know that he doesn't even know
how to set the table when he's by himself.

90
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,394
Then let him starve!

91
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,147
It won't kill him to skip a meal!

92
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,359
Mom, aren't you even worried
about your daughter lying in the hospital?

93
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,572
Also, how could you abandon me
and run away from home?

94
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,824
When did I abandon you?

95
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,620
So, why was the house such a mess?
Why were you and Do-hun gone?

96
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,290
Oh, that? Do-hun did all that,

97
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,336
and I went after him because I thought
he stole money and ran away from home.

98
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,088
You're so loud.
I can't concentrate on the game.

99
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,760
Ouch!

100
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,972
Hey, what's up with you?

101
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,599
"Hey"?

102
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,852
Who do you think you are?
Are you my older brother or something?

103
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,189
You keep acting up,
thinking Mom's on your side.

104
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,441
Keep it up, and I'll beat you like a drum!

105
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,362
Mom, it's all your fault
that he's a little brat like this!

106
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,406
It's because you are always
so lenient with him.

107
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,617
But you always tell me
to be understanding!

108
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,204
I mean, seriously.
Am I really your daughter? Am I?

109
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,833
-Oh, goodness!
-Min-ju!

110
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,172
It's understandable that you're angry,
but you shouldn't be here right now.

111
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,132
He's right. Let's go to the hospital.

112
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,593
I will go myself.

113
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,140
Yeon-jun, please take me to the hospital.

114
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,352
Me? I told you. I'm Nam Si-heon.

115
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:25,356
I don't care what your name is.
Just take me to the hospital!

116
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,234
Let's go.

117
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,531
Hey, Kwon Min-ju!

118
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,949
-Goodness!
-Min-ju!

119
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,579
Now look this way.

120
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,045
Can you tell me your name and your age?

121
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,171
I'm Han Jun-hee.

122
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,924
Oh.

123
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
Kwon Min-ju?

124
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,847
I think my name is Kwon Min-ju.

125
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
How about your age?

126
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,351
I'm 36 years…

127
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,355
No, I mean, I'm 18.

128
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm 18 years old.

129
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,277
Do you remember
how you ended up in the hospital?

130
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,995
Yes, I remember.
I was in a car accident, right?

131
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
Are you sure it was a car accident?

132
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,335
Yes.

133
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,506
Doctor, is her condition that bad?

134
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,427
Her wounds aren't as serious as I thought.

135
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:42,141
Her confusion could stem
from the shock of the accident,

136
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,437
but we'll keep her here
for a few days and observe her.

137
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,355
-Okay.
-Okay.

138
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,940
Thank you so much.

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,781
Why are you boys still here?

140
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,203
Oh, now that we know she's all right,
we'll get going.

141
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,497
We'll get going, then.

142
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:30,564
Min-ju, the police will be visiting later
to ask you a few questions.

143
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,191
But why?

144
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,487
You weren't hurt
because you were hit by a car.

145
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:43,035
You were found lying unconscious
on the road with your head bleeding.

146
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,830
A passerby saw you and reported it.

147
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,753
But that could've been
because I got hit by a car, right?

148
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,631
According to the police,
the shape of the wound on your head

149
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,218
suggests that someone hit you
from behind with a blunt object.

150
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,273
Hey, Jung In-gyu.

151
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,700
Are you mad at me?

152
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,165
Oh. Kwon Min-ju hugged me back there

153
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,417
because she mistook me
for someone else, so--

154
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,961
I'm mad about what happened that day,
not today.

155
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,922
-What do you mean?
-On Min-ju's birthday.

156
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,136
I saw everything.
Min-ju telling you that she liked you.

157
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,055
I'm never going to like you in that way.

158
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,933
Is it because In-gyu likes me?

159
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,146
-Because he's your friend?
-It has nothing to do with In-gyu.

160
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,231
I consider you a friend.

161
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,150
I've never thought of you
as anything else.

162
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,946
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear what you just said.

163
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,699
So make sure you don't show it
in front of In-gyu. Okay?

164
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,409
I'll get going.

165
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,260
I kept thinking about it
after Min-ju's injury.

166
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,931
If you hadn't said those things
to her that day,

167
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,974
Min-ju wouldn't have gotten hurt.

168
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,938
Are you saying the accident happened
because I rejected her?

169
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,901
I don't have any feelings for her.
Should I have still accepted her feelings?

170
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,278
You didn't have to be so cruel to her!

171
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,949
If you hadn't hurt her,
she would've asked us for help that night.

172
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,580
Hey, Jung In-gyu.
Are you actually mad at me right now?

173
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,544
Or are you mad at yourself
for pushing Kwon Min-ju on me?

174
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,927
You are right.
I have no reason to be angry at you.

175
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,992
Your sister's back from the hospital.
Aren't you going to say hi?

176
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,244
Hi.

177
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,127
What is it?

178
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,425
Based on this familiar feeling
of annoyance,

179
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,804
you're definitely my little brother,
yet something is unfamiliar about you too.

180
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,018
It's so strange.

181
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,230
It's all right. It's fine.
It's just an aftereffect of the accident.

182
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,361
They still haven't caught your attacker,

183
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,614
so don't go around alone
for the time being.

184
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,991
Okay, Uncle.

185
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,327
Go to your room and rest.

186
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,922
-Why are you going that way?
-What?

187
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,965
Your room is upstairs.

188
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,555
I knew that.

189
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,308
I was just testing you to see if you knew.

190
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,563
Why would you test me?

191
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,149
Min-ju.

192
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,985
Why would you--
Mom, is she okay to be home?

193
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,362
Will you just be quiet?

194
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,730
This is definitely not my style.

195
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,361
I've been wearing clothes like this?

196
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,867
LOGARITHMS
CHANGE OF BASE FORMULA

197
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,051
It's been a month since the new semester
of the new year started.

198
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,140
I've been trying hard to fit in
with the other kids,

199
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,684
but I've failed yet again.

200
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,315
Every year, every new semester,

201
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:52,654
even though I try, I always end up failing
to make friends with the other students.

202
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,243
I try talking to them
and even pretend to laugh at their jokes.

203
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:03,373
But in the end, I am always left alone,
as if it had already been decided.

204
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,336
Wait, I kept
a depressing journal like this?

205
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,715
I mean, how can a journal be
this dark and sad?

206
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,014
Every time I see him,

207
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,017
I find myself holding my breath
upon seeing his dazzling smile.

208
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:22,935
I did it.

209
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,104
Let me try it again.

210
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,525
Every time I look at him,
almost as if his smile is contagious,

211
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,611
I find myself smiling.

212
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,539
How is it that I can't
take my eyes off Nam Si-heon,

213
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,210
even though doing so
makes me feel small every time?

214
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:53,715
Even though I feel more and more miserable
the more I like him?

215
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,940
-Yes?
-Can you come out for a minute?

216
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,733
The Noksan police are here.

217
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,364
How are you feeling?

218
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,243
I'm feeling much better now.

219
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:27,791
Do you remember who attacked you
on the day of the accident, by any chance?

220
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,668
No.

221
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,380
To be honest,
I don't even remember being attacked.

222
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,718
Then, what's the last thing you remember?

223
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,053
Being hit by a car.

224
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,974
Where did it happen?

225
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,395
You know, that big road
near the Noksan intersection.

226
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,064
That's quite far
from where you were found.

227
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:57,738
Knee fractures are commonly observed
when a car hits a pedestrian.

228
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,366
But your doctor didn't say anything
about your knees getting hurt.

229
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,163
Well, my knees
were just slightly scratched.

230
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,002
Then it's highly unlikely
that this was a car accident.

231
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,633
On top of that, your wound indicates
you were hit with a blunt object.

232
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,350
That's really weird.

233
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,270
I have no recollection of getting hit
on the head.

234
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,609
If Min-ju's memories don't come back,

235
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,278
does that mean
you can't catch the attacker?

236
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,365
Right now, we're investigating the area

237
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,451
and questioning people
to find any witnesses or evidence.

238
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:49,081
Still, it'd be best
if Min-ju regained her memory.

239
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,710
Call us at this number
if you remember anything, okay?

240
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,879
Okay.

241
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,797
Thank you.

242
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,209
I don't remember
making enemies with anyone,

243
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,797
let alone getting into any arguments
with anyone.

244
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,551
So, who on earth could've attacked me?

245
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,890
This is frustrating.

246
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,644
What was that noise?

247
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,705
Here. Have a drumstick.

248
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,000
What's with the chicken?

249
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,879
For your strength.
You just got out of the hospital. Enjoy.

250
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,678
What made you come all the way here
with chicken?

251
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,395
About what I said on your birthday…

252
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,357
Oh, that.

253
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,152
That you would never like me back?

254
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,279
Yes, about that.

255
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,197
Yeah.

256
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,576
I hope you won't avoid me and In-gyu
just because I said that.

257
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,581
If you're in any trouble, don't wander off
on your own like that day,

258
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,875
and feel free to ask us for help.

259
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,754
I mean, how can I do that
after you rejected me like that?

260
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,172
Just because I rejected--

261
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,468
Just because I said those things
doesn't mean that we're no longer friends.

262
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,720
We can't even be friends
since you rejected me.

263
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,141
This is exactly why friends
shouldn't express feelings so easily.

264
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,611
What?

265
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,323
Are you really Kwon Min-ju?

266
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,494
I mean, in the past,
you would've been so embarrassed

267
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,621
if I had asked you
these kinds of questions.

268
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,248
But now…

269
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,834
What about now?

270
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,170
It seems like you're talking
about someone.

271
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,468
You're right.

272
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,970
Exactly. Yes, you're right.

273
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,472
That's been driving me nuts.

274
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,807
When I read through my journal

275
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,227
or hear about the things I've said,
done, and thought about,

276
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:45,442
that was clearly me,
but it just doesn't feel like that was me.

277
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,069
Koo Yeon-jun, you said
that you rejected me, right?

278
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,363
Koo Yeon-jun. That name again.

279
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,325
But I'd never confess feelings like that
and get rejected.

280
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,118
When's the right moment?

281
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,998
Only when you've been flirting for a while
and are certain you won't get rejected.

282
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,250
No rejections for me.

283
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,465
Let me ask you this.

284
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,426
Who on earth is Koo Yeon-jun?

285
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,385
What?

286
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,388
You've been calling me Koo Yeon-jun
since the hospital.

287
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,515
Who is Koo Yeon-jun?

288
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,981
You'll think I'm crazy if I tell you this.

289
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,149
No, it's all right.

290
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,735
I already suspect you're not
in your right mind.

291
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
Come on, tell me.

292
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,449
We've shared a secret
with each other already.

293
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,332
To be honest,

294
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,753
ever since I woke up,
it hasn't felt like I'm Kwon Min-ju.

295
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,838
You know that feeling?

296
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,175
You wake up after a long dream,

297
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,513
but the dream seems like reality,
and the me now is the one that isn't real.

298
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,182
Then, who are you?

299
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,228
In my dream, I was Han Jun-hee,
not Kwon Min-ju.

300
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,982
And you. You weren't Nam Si-heon,
but Koo Yeon-jun.

301
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,946
When I was Jun-hee in the dream,
unlike Min-ju, I spoke my mind,

302
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,408
and I was really successful at work too.

303
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,038
So tell me more about this Koo Yeon-jun.

304
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,632
I met you…

305
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,428
I mean, Koo Yeon-jun, in college.

306
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,555
IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME

307
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,818
Boo.

308
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,030
Boo!

309
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,242
Never mind.

310
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,539
IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME

311
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,294
In my dream, you treated me

312
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,590
like you'd known me for a long time,
from the time we first met.

313
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,139
It was like you knew me better than I did
without me having to say a word, you know?

314
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,143
We started living together
after we graduated from college.

315
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,897
Neither of us had any money then,

316
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,857
so we lived in a basement studio.

317
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,943
But we were still really happy
in that home.

318
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,032
We were engaged to be married,

319
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,370
and I thought I'd live happily ever after
with you, Yeon-jun.

320
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,290
But Yeon-jun…

321
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,336
passed away in an accident.

322
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,090
After you were gone,

323
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,095
I lived on without being able to erase
a single trace of you.

324
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,816
I knew in my head that you had died…

325
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,028
but my heart couldn't accept it.

326
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,938
I didn't think it was this much.

327
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,901
-Huh?
-I didn't know you liked me this much.

328
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,611
What?

329
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,031
You liked me so much
that you had all these dreams.

330
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,911
I'm going to go. Bye.

331
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,163
You know I'm right.

332
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,461
I don't even know why I liked you
in the first place.

333
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,589
You're joking around
when I'm talking to you seriously.

334
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,635
Also, the man I like is Koo Yeon-jun
from my dream, not you, Nam Si-heon.

335
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,387
So, please! I beg of you!

336
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,099
Will you please forget what I said to you
or that I told you I liked you?

337
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,061
I was the one that said we should pretend
it never happened first, okay?

338
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,732
You told me that you liked me,
and now you tell me that you don't.

339
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,108
Seriously, what's with you?

340
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,652
I asked you to forget what I said.
Why are you so mad?

341
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,408
Oh, you sort of had feelings for me,
didn't you?

342
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,493
Hey, why would I…

343
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,330
Oh, this is all a part of your plan,
isn't it?

344
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,247
What do you mean?

345
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,832
You were embarrassed I rejected you,

346
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,543
so you made up that dream
about Koo Yeon-jun, right?

347
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,589
It's not like that.
In my dream, I really was--

348
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,884
Never mind. Forget it.

349
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,136
Hey, Kwon Min-ju!

350
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,808
I understand that you're embarrassed,
but you still shouldn't make things up.

351
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,017
It'll become a habit.

352
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,394
Worry about yourself, you jerk!

353
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,363
You were embarrassed I rejected you,

354
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,407
so you made up that dream
about Koo Yeon-jun, right?

355
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,992
What a jerk!

356
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,537
I told him because he asked me!

357
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,835
So annoying!

358
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,600
She's changed.

359
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,894
She's changed completely.

360
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,980
She's nothing like Kwon Min-ju.

361
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,441
Is it because she hurt her head?

362
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,175
Is it really you, Yeon-jun?

363
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,349
I missed you so much, Yeon-jun!

364
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,651
Neither of us had any money then,

365
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,695
so we lived in a basement studio.

366
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,864
But we were really happy in that home.

367
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,035
I thought I'd live happily ever after
with you, Yeon-jun.

368
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,039
But Yeon-jun passed away in an accident.

369
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,654
Hey!

370
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,127
Wow, how can he sleep through this?

371
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,212
Hey, Kwon Do-hun!

372
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,506
Hey, get up!

373
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,174
Get up!

374
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,562
Do we look alike?

375
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:18,329
There's definitely a resemblance.
But why doesn't it feel like she's my mom?

376
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,009
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm going to be late!

377
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,594
My school's not like yours.
They'll kill me if I'm late!

378
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,722
I actually did wake you.

379
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,683
And you're in high school.
Do you need someone to wake you up?

380
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:43,146
Turn off the alarm right away from now on,
or I'm going to smash it with a hammer.

381
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,783
Breakfast.

382
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,161
Go get it yourself.

383
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,164
Do you expect your sick sister
to serve it for you?

384
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,336
Mom, Min-ju didn't wake me up, and now
she wants me to get my own breakfast.

385
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,799
From now on, wake up by yourself.

386
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,135
You can't rely on your sister forever.

387
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,804
Did you sleep well?

388
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,723
I did.

389
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,225
Oh. I made some bean sprout soup
for you, Mom.

390
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,394
Don't worry about it. I'll get it myself.

391
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,231
What a great daughter I have.
You made soup for my hangover.

392
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,485
Hold on.

393
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,946
You have to eat well
in order to get better.

394
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,325
I'll make bulgogi for dinner tonight.
Your favorite.

395
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,451
Bulgogi?

396
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,036
Hey…

397
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,333
I mean… Sis, aren't you going to school?

398
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,919
Your sister is still sick.

399
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,672
The attacker hasn't been caught yet.
I'm scared to send her to school.

400
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,343
You still can't remember
the attacker, right?

401
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,345
No.

402
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,475
You'll have to be extra careful
until they catch that lunatic, okay?

403
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,684
Okay.

404
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,904
Kwon Do-hun, do the dishes
before you head out to school.

405
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,988
Who, me?

406
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,033
Did you just tell me to do the dishes
right now?

407
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,871
-Mom!
-Gosh, I feel sick.

408
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,302
I can make breakfast for myself.
You should've slept more, Grandma.

409
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,056
It's all right.
At my age, it's hard to sleep in.

410
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:47,603
You're the one who should sleep more.
You must be tired from studying.

411
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,236
Oh, didn't you…

412
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:00,199
didn't you say you lost that hearing aid?

413
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,951
Did you find it?

414
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,372
No, I couldn't find it. So I'm using
the one I used to use long ago.

415
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,499
Right.

416
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,628
Where could you have lost it?

417
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,550
Should I buy you a new one?

418
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,470
I heard that there are new ones
that are quite nice.

419
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,722
I'm okay with this one.

420
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,516
Okay.

421
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,685
Come on, eat up.

422
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,153
Now, look.

423
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:42,074
Two theories, evolutionary and cyclical,
are used to explain social change.

424
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,160
In evolutionary theory,

425
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,496
society progresses or develops
in one direction…

426
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,791
In my dream, I was Han Jun-hee,
not Kwon Min-ju.

427
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,629
And you. You weren't Nam Si-heon,
but Koo Yeon-jun.

428
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,382
…rise and fall
in an endless series of cycles.

429
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,344
They rise and fall,
rise and fall, like this.

430
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,512
Do you understand?

431
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,014
Yes.

432
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,059
KOO YEON-JUN

433
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,896
Now, again. The evolutionary theory
is about progression and development,

434
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,982
while the cyclical theory
is about rise and fall.

435
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,110
This is important.

436
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,529
It'll be on your next test.

437
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,447
Okay.

438
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,369
Attention! Bow!

439
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,412
Thank you!

440
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,008
Jung In-gyu!

441
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,310
Wait for me.
You're going to see Min-ju, right?

442
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,853
I can go by myself.

443
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,022
But you told me to be nice to her.

444
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,526
Besides, her attacker could appear
at any moment.

445
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,986
How could I let you go alone?

446
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,863
I have to go with you and protect you,
you know?

447
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,323
Let's go.

448
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:08,244
Hey, about snapping at you the other day…

449
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,163
Can't hear you!
If you're gonna apologize, forget it.

450
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,125
Come on.

451
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,921
Who is it?

452
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,758
-Hi.
-What the heck?

453
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,179
What are you guys doing here?

454
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,639
How's your head?

455
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,518
My head? It's fine.
I have a hard head, you know.

456
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,477
Of course you do.

457
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,522
Why are you here?

458
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,192
The attacker hasn't been caught yet.
We'll catch them.

459
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,446
How will we catch the attacker
that the police couldn't catch?

460
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,490
There's a way.
First, we have to go somewhere.

461
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,825
Where?

462
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,578
The first step in any investigation.

463
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,956
Revisit the scene of the crime first.

464
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:03,966
Over here.

465
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,635
-Here?
-Yeah.

466
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,930
On that day, a cab was coming down
from up there.

467
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,683
And I ran after it down here to catch it.

468
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,812
But I couldn't catch the cab.
Then a car sped toward me.

469
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,941
I definitely thought
that the car had hit me then.

470
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,942
And then?

471
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,531
And then I don't remember
what happened next.

472
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,334
Do you remember this place?

473
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,962
You were lying here
that morning when you hurt your head.

474
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,547
I was here?

475
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,388
-You don't remember?
-No, I don't remember.

476
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,683
This place is quite a distance to walk
at your pace

477
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,019
from where you said
the car hit you, right?

478
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:03,317
Then, why were you lying here
if you can't even remember coming here?

479
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,747
The attacker must've dragged you here.

480
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,209
-The attacker?
-Yeah, that would explain everything.

481
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,671
Min-ju has to remember on her own.

482
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,756
You can't plant false memories
in her head.

483
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,759
She can't remember,
so I'm coming up with theories.

484
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,137
How are those theories?
They're leading questions.

485
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:37,685
Did you meet anyone you knew that night,
by any chance?

486
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,271
You're basically doing what I did.

487
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,272
No, I'm not.

488
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,189
How so?

489
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,525
Hey, wait a minute.

490
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,944
Be quiet so I can gather my thoughts.

491
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,613
That night, you guys
threw me a birthday party,

492
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,034
and after that, I went home…

493
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,789
Yeon-jun, In-gyu,
you're confusing me even more.

494
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,958
You called me Koo Yeon-jun again.
I'm not him!

495
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,669
He's your boyfriend in your dream.

496
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,504
I told you to forget that, didn't I?

497
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,888
What are you talking about?
Her boyfriend in her dream?

498
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,141
Well, that's….

499
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,019
I don't think
I can remember anything today.

500
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,104
Let's head back now.

501
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,570
Is there something I'm missing?

502
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,989
You should ask Kwon Min-ju yourself.

503
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,949
I didn't understand what she said anyway.

504
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,140
Thanks for the ride. Bye!

505
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,607
What is it?

506
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,402
Do you have something to say?

507
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,661
Well…

508
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,166
Can I ask about the dream
Si-heon was talking about earlier?

509
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,753
Oh, that? It really is nothing.

510
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,509
-No need to tell me if it's uncomfortable.
-No, it's not that.

511
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,099
So, I had this dream
while I was in the hospital.

512
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,353
In that dream,
I was this person called Han Jun-hee.

513
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,314
Nam Si-heon was this person
called Koo Yeon-jun.

514
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,191
And those two…

515
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,656
were in love with each other in the dream.

516
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,743
It's really weird, isn't it?

517
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,787
I know it sounds really weird,

518
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,583
but the Koo Yeon-jun in my dream
felt real.

519
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,713
So that's why Koo Yeon-jun pops up
in my mind whenever I see Nam Si-heon.

520
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,428
If it was Koo Yeon-jun you liked so much
in your dream…

521
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,890
doesn't that mean
it's not Si-heon you like

522
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,269
but actually Koo Yeon-jun?

523
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,650
And that makes me feel
like I still have a chance.

524
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,653
Oh, about that, In-gyu--

525
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,030
Let me tell you officially.

526
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,199
I like you.

527
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,954
I've had my eye on you for a long time.

528
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,459
-Hurry up and run!
-You hurry up!

529
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,668
We'll lose our seats!

530
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,790
"I'm so sick and tired of being alone."

531
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,794
"I wish somebody would understand me."

532
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,715
"I wish someone would…"

533
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:41,345
…accept me for who I am
instead of treating me like a weirdo!

534
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,183
I wanted to tell you back then…

535
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,978
that I also understand

536
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,815
what it feels like

537
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,110
to be left out and alone.

538
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,364
-Want to grab some burgers later?
-Sounds good.

539
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,657
-Burgers, then?
-Yes.

540
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,450
-Nam Si-heon!
-Let's go.

541
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,246
-What's this?
-The science test topics are out.

542
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,707
We need to know the reactions
of potassium to lead.

543
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,836
What are you doing? Come on!

544
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,468
Let's go.

545
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,557
He knocked this guy out
with a single blow.

546
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,516
Isn't it awesome?

547
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,018
Really? This is so unreal.

548
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,187
Look at this.

549
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,440
Look at him go. Isn't he awesome?

550
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,191
Like, seriously.

551
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,444
He can't be real.

552
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,570
Back then,

553
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,199
I got scared and gave up
when I found out that you liked Si-heon.

554
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,994
But I only realized after you got hurt

555
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,788
that what's worse
than getting rejected is…

556
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,876
regretting not telling you how I feel.

557
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,015
In-gyu,

558
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,101
I truly appreciate that you like me.

559
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,812
But right now, I--

560
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,689
You don't have to tell me right now.

561
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,650
I just wanted you to know…

562
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,446
that you're a very important

563
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,450
and meaningful person to me.

564
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,204
Take your time with your answer.

565
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,342
The entire time I was listening
to In-gyu tell me how he felt,

566
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,970
I was thinking I wasn't the one
who should be hearing this.

567
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,099
In-gyu was definitely talking about us,

568
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,269
but it felt like I was hearing him talk
about someone else.

569
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,523
That's why I couldn't say anything,

570
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,275
despite knowing
how much it hurt him to tell me.

571
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,779
I don't know why I'm thinking such things.

572
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,491
Is this all because of that stupid dream?

573
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,958
Kwon Min-ju!

574
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,719
I still can't remember what happened
on the day of the accident,

575
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,305
but everything soon went back to normal.

576
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,893
Now that everything is familiar,

577
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,522
I can't believe
I had an accident like that.

578
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:44,903
Kwon Min-ju!

579
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,716
Hey, Nam Si-heon! Jung In-gyu!

580
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,176
This isn't a comic book store.
Go read them at home!

581
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,845
-Uh-huh. Okay.
-Uh-huh.

582
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,468
Hey, that's my uncle's. Put it down!

583
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,098
Hey, put it down!

584
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,141
Put it down!

585
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,060
-Why?
-Put it down!

586
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,520
Stop fooling around
and give that back to Min-ju.

587
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,316
My uncle will kill me if it breaks!

588
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,944
For this? I mean, how much could it be?

589
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,111
Is it expensive?

590
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:10,781
You little brat.

591
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,367
Do you know how hard that was to come by?

592
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,996
Why did you get a camera if you were
just going to let it gather dust?

593
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:19,998
Why, you little…

594
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,960
You deserved that.

595
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,546
-Yeah, you got what you deserved!
-Why are you hitting me?

596
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,091
Serves you right!

597
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,009
I knew you'd get punished.

598
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,136
Right, In-gyu?

599
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,517
Get closer, you three.

600
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,146
All right. On the count of three.

601
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,316
Three, two, one.

602
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:53,156
We've been spending time together
as if we'd been close friends for years.

603
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,450
As time went by,

604
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,121
the dream I had while I was unconscious
started fading away.

605
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,001
And the feeling that I am not Kwon Min-ju
is going away too.

606
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,754
But what I find difficult to understand

607
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:14,011
is that, strangely, once in a while,
the man from the dream, Koo Yeon-jun,

608
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:19,016
still comes to mind
when I see Nam Si-heon in front of me.

609
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,171
My uncle printed some extra copies
while he was at it. This one's yours.

610
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:53,592
Kwon Min-ju. Her handwriting is awful.
It's nothing like how she seems.

611
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,299
Why did you turn it off?
I was listening to it.

612
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,260
What do you mean you were listening?
You were nodding off.

613
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,055
You should try other songs too.

614
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,349
Stop listening to the same song.

615
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:46,978
Okay.

616
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,563
Hello.

617
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,900
We're from Noksan Police Station.

618
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,321
Oh, you must be here
to investigate Min-ju's case.

619
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,864
Yes. How have you been?

620
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:03,078
I've been okay, but I still can't remember
anything that happened that day.

621
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,915
We're actually here to show you something.

622
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,377
We found this at the crime scene
and were wondering if you recognized it.

623
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,674
That's the hearing aid that I always wear.

624
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,678
Without it, I can't hear anything
with my right ear.

625
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,267
Was this dropped by the attacker?

626
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,688
Well, we'll need to investigate further
to see if it's the attacker's.

627
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:34,109
Is there anyone you know
with a hearing impairment, by any chance?

628
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,163
Help me!

629
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,622
Help me!

630
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,227
Miss?

631
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,190
This is the last stop.
You need to get off.

632
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,529
Where are we? Are we in Noksan?

633
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,530
Noksan?

634
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,366
No. We're in Seoul, of course.

635
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,743
Did you say Seoul?

636
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,957
Then, is it 2023 now?

637
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,584
Not 1998?

638
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,379
Yes, this is the year 2023.

639
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,883
You must still be half-asleep.
Get off the bus, please.

640
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,941
I was definitely Kwon Min-ju
just a moment ago.

641
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,881
So, that was all a dream?

642
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,325
YEON-JUN

643
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,796
9:21 P.M.
YEON-JUN, I MISS YOU SO MUCH

644
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,646
YEON-JUN

645
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,033
YEON-JUN
DIALING

646
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,387
Hello?

647
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,235
