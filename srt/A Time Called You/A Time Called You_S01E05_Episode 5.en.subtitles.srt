1
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,773
Hey, you should've woken me up
if you were awake.

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,318
You looked like you were sleeping soundly.

3
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,744
So, what's been on your mind?

4
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,456
It's late. I'll tell you next time.

5
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,542
-Should we get going?
-Yeah.

6
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,211
A TIME CALLED YOU

7
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,587
MAJOR CRIMES UNIT 2

8
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,882
You know a student named Kwon Min-ju
in your class, right?

9
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,217
Yes.

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,387
Do you also know that someone recently
struck her, causing her injury?

11
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,140
Yes.

12
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,143
Do you happen to remember
what you were doing on June 10th,

13
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,978
the night of Min-ju's incident?

14
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,940
It's okay.

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,900
Just tell him what you know.

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,076
I visited the store where Min-ju works
with my friend, Si-heon.

17
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,661
So, did you see Min-ju?

18
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,578
Yes.

19
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,666
It was Min-ju's birthday,
so we threw her a birthday party.

20
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,210
What did you do after the birthday party?

21
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,839
I went home.

22
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,844
How about Min-ju?

23
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,470
As for Min-ju,

24
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,348
Si-heon probably took her home.

25
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,231
Jung In-gyu. Is there anything
you've forgotten to tell me?

26
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,027
A nearby security camera caught you

27
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,864
going in the direction
of Min-ju's house that night.

28
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,742
Why did you follow her that day?

29
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,872
Hey! Jung In-gyu!

30
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,915
What was that?

31
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,676
From now on, say hi back
when I say hi at school.

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,928
You'll do that, won't you?

33
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,454
I'm never going to like you in that way.

34
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,707
Is it because Jung In-gyu likes me?

35
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,626
Because he's your friend?

36
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,213
I had something to tell her.

37
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,255
What was that?

38
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,132
That's…

39
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,678
That's…

40
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,682
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

41
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,310
In-gyu.

42
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,230
You have to tell him, okay?

43
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
Hurry up and tell him the truth.

44
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,444
Grandma, I didn't do anything wrong.

45
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,698
If that's the case,
can you explain this evidence?

46
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,244
This hearing aid was found at the scene.

47
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,289
When I traced the serial number,
it turned out this belonged to you.

48
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,417
Your hearing aid at the crime scene.

49
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,587
The footage of you following Min-ju.

50
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,548
Those were enough to put you
on the list of suspects.

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,301
Goodness, what are you talking about?

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,638
He's not that kind of child.
That's absurd.

53
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,225
It must be a misunderstanding.
Yes, that must be it.

54
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,481
If we can't find any witnesses or evidence
to prove In-gyu's alibi on the day,

55
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,484
we have no choice
but to consider him a suspect.

56
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,820
Oh dear.

57
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,033
EVIDENCE
HEARING AID

58
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,712
Stop…

59
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,759
staring at me with the face
that looks just like Yeon-jun's.

60
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,517
I shouldn't be resting like this.

61
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,938
I still haven't found a way
to go back to 2023.

62
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,112
The other day,
when I first came to see you,

63
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,408
you said that Min-ju
had already passed away, right?

64
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,702
Yes.

65
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,163
Then…

66
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,877
would it be possible for you to tell me

67
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,880
exactly when

68
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,466
and how she died?

69
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,847
It was October 13th, 1998.

70
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,018
And Min-ju…

71
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,397
was murdered.

72
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,320
Perhaps

73
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:07,367
your dreams of going back to 1998
and becoming Min-ju

74
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:12,080
are connected
to what happened to her back then too.

75
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,541
If all of this is connected,

76
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:21,005
then couldn't this mean
there's a second chance for Min-ju?

77
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,763
I'm not sure what you mean.

78
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,101
If the two of you are connected
by some kind of thread,

79
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,480
and if you could pull that thread
and change the past,

80
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,441
maybe it could prevent Min-ju's murder.

81
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,196
Today is July 10th, 1998.

82
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,658
And the day Kwon Min-ju
is supposed to be murdered is…

83
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,543
October 13th, 1998.

84
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,548
That means there are only three months
until the day she gets murdered.

85
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,554
Wait, what?

86
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,724
If I stay here like this,
I could get killed.

87
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,354
Take me as I am right now

88
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,023
To your arms

89
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm yours

90
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,781
-Can you knock?
-Let me use your computer.

91
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:33,953
Min-ju.

92
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,706
Uncle, I'm in Do-hun's room.

93
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,335
Why didn't you go to school
or come to the store today?

94
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,171
I had something to do today.

95
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,506
Going to school
is what a student needs to do.

96
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,426
-What was it?
-Something just came up.

97
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,011
Why is this computer so slow?

98
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,804
Hey, does this even work?

99
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,098
Just wait.
Getting mad won't make it any faster.

100
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,686
You've never skipped school.
What's gotten into you these days?

101
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,356
Have you finally hit the rebellious phase?
You're not quitting school, are you?

102
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,108
Come on, Uncle.

103
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,528
Anything's possible
with the way she's been acting lately.

104
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,877
Gonna hit me again?

105
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,092
Go get some ice cream.

106
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,678
With just 1,000 won?

107
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,645
This is ridiculous.

108
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,074
You're going to find out anyway,
so I'll tell you everything now.

109
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,202
There's a reason why I haven't been acting

110
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,955
like the Min-ju you know.

111
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,125
To be honest…

112
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,879
I'm not Kwon Min-ju.

113
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,594
So, what you're saying is
that you're not Kwon Min-ju

114
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,640
but Han Jun-hee from the year 2023?

115
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,809
Yes.

116
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,354
And in 2023, I gave you a journal,

117
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,440
asking you to go back to 1998

118
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,528
and change the course of fate
so Min-ju doesn't die?

119
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,863
That's right. That's exactly right.

120
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,657
You've hit the nail on the head.

121
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,701
Uncle-- I mean, sir.

122
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,620
I knew you'd understand
what I'm saying right away.

123
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,539
However, the problem now

124
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:46,419
is that I have no idea
how I can go back to 2023.

125
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:51,173
That's why you have to help me.
So I can get back.

126
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,386
I know what I need to do.

127
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,763
You do?

128
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,182
Let's go.

129
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,225
Where?

130
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,185
The hospital, of course.

131
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,396
Let's go get you examined.

132
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,857
You hurt your head,
so you're talking nonsense now.

133
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,275
Come on, let's--

134
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,153
I'm not saying this
because I hurt my head or went insane!

135
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,988
Are you really going to be like this?

136
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,073
Uncle, when you told me all of that…

137
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,161
Oh, that's right.

138
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,247
That hasn't happened yet.

139
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:31,130
You're also eventually going to find out
what I've just told you, okay?

140
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,841
Uncle, what can I do
to make you believe me?

141
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,679
I mean, why won't he believe me?

142
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,931
I am Han Jun-hee from 2023,

143
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,060
and I'm in Kwon Min-ju's body temporarily.

144
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,853
Is that so hard to accept?

145
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,565
Of course it's hard.

146
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,360
Who would ever believe this?

147
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,915
From now on,
stay away from her as much as possible.

148
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,627
Because if Min-ju keeps seeing you,
it'll be hard for her to get over you.

149
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,421
I'm asking you this as a friend.

150
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,051
Yes, of course, friendship comes first.

151
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,723
Damn it. This is driving me crazy!

152
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,609
-Hey, Jung In-gyu is here.
-He's here.

153
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,572
I heard he went to the police station.

154
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,032
-Because of Kwon Min-ju?
-Really?

155
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,411
Hey, how can a kid
who did something like that come to…

156
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,621
Man, you never know with people.

157
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,081
Hey, go easy on him.

158
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,332
Look who it is.

159
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,586
I thought you wouldn't come to school,
but here you are, huh?

160
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,215
Hey, how can you be studying now?

161
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,844
I've known it since you and Nam Si-heon
started being nice to Kwon Min-ju.

162
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,846
You tried to get it on with her

163
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,223
and hit her head
because she resisted, right?

164
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,641
Hey, dude.

165
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,811
Tell us, you shady little punk.

166
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,897
Were you also rejected by Kwon Min-ju?

167
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,739
Hey.

168
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,825
Have you lost your mind?

169
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,956
I told you to leave Jung In-gyu alone.

170
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,416
Get off me, damn it.

171
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,254
Surely, you would know

172
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,216
whether Jung In-gyu
tried to kill Kwon Min-ju or not.

173
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,886
What do you mean?

174
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,306
Jung In-gyu was taken
to the police station yesterday.

175
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,935
What's all this?

176
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,022
What do you mean
"what's all this," you idiot?

177
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,777
They took him to the police station
as a suspect in Min-ju's attempted murder.

178
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,862
There's even evidence that it was him.

179
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,199
This bastard is a suspect
in an attempted murder now.

180
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,704
Wow, I guess you really didn't know.
Are you guys actually friends?

181
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:12,958
Or who knows?

182
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,961
Perhaps you did it,

183
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,923
and Jung In-gyu's taking the blame.

184
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,383
-What?
-He's your underling, isn't he?

185
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,304
He'd do anything you told him to,

186
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,515
probably even take the blame for murder.

187
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,892
You bastard!

188
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,395
What did you just say?
I dare you to run your mouth again.

189
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,898
Break it up, you two!

190
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,739
Nam Si-heon, didn't you hear me?

191
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,785
Everyone, sit down!

192
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,167
Jung In-gyu.

193
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,753
Come with me.

194
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,890
He did give me a creepy vibe.

195
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,811
Why…

196
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
shouldn't I come to school?

197
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,192
Well, the thing is,

198
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,778
I'm not telling you to quit school.

199
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,657
I'm just suggesting
you stay home for a little while.

200
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,119
-I haven't done anything wrong.
-I know that.

201
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,453
I believe you.

202
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,040
You're a model student,
so it couldn't have been you, right?

203
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:35,958
Then why…

204
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,752
It looks like the reporters
have heard about it.

205
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,381
We got a few calls this morning
asking if it's true

206
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:48,137
that a suspect in an attempted murder
is a student at this school.

207
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,472
If the reporters are aware of it,

208
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,892
they'll barge into the school in no time.

209
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:58,480
They might wait at the school gates
and even jump at you for an interview.

210
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,904
So it'd be better for you to stay home
for a few days until it all blows over.

211
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,245
If I don't come to school,

212
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,415
it'll look like I'm hiding
because I'm guilty.

213
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,503
I don't want to do that.

214
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,801
We are just trying to protect
both you and Min-ju right now.

215
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,932
The victim and the suspect
would be studying in the same classroom.

216
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,936
How would Min-ju feel if she saw you?

217
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,029
Hello.

218
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,365
Do you remember me?

219
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,867
I met you at the hospital
the day Min-ju woke up.

220
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,912
Oh, you're Min-ju's friend.

221
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,206
Is Min-ju home, by any chance?

222
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,249
-She is, but…
-Mom, who is it?

223
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,960
Oh? Your friend.

224
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,877
Kwon Min-ju.

225
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,754
Wait. Shouldn't you be at school?

226
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,132
-Is there something wrong?
-I need your help.

227
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,133
What?

228
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,218
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

229
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,637
Hey, where are you going? Gosh, Min-ju!

230
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,555
My goodness. Their hands…

231
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,401
It's always the kids who look like that…

232
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,611
-Exactly.
-Seriously.

233
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,406
It's scary.

234
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,255
Oh, there's In-gyu.

235
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,518
Si-heon told me about it.

236
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,355
It wasn't me.

237
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,524
I lost that hearing aid.

238
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,571
We found this at the crime scene
and wonder if you recognize it.

239
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:22,124
You don't think I did it,
by any chance, do you?

240
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,587
Then you're my friend,
like Si-heon, from now on.

241
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,967
I just wanted you to know
that you're a very important

242
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,929
and meaningful person to me.

243
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,266
You don't believe me either.

244
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,611
Come with me.

245
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,829
All right, then.
What did you want to tell me?

246
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:10,089
In-gyu wasn't the one that hit me
on the back of the head that night.

247
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,092
Is that so? Are your memories coming back?

248
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,593
No, not really.

249
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,388
How can you be so sure?

250
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,808
The hearing aid
that was found at the scene,

251
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,812
it wasn't In-gyu who dropped it.
It was me.

252
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,898
You? Why did you have his hearing aid?

253
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,610
Actually, Si-heon and In-gyu came

254
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,447
to the store that night
to throw me a birthday party.

255
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,909
I was tidying up to go home,
and I found it on the ground.

256
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,079
So I kept it to return it to him later.

257
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,332
So, what you're saying is

258
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,585
that the person who had the hearing aid
at the time of the incident

259
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,295
wasn't In-gyu, but you?

260
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:55,968
Yes. I definitely remember picking up
the hearing aid and holding onto it.

261
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,013
But what I still don't get is,

262
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:05,686
when Si-heon was taking Min-ju home,
why did you follow them, In-gyu?

263
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,404
Well, In-gyu must have realized
he had lost his hearing aid

264
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,907
and probably came to ask
if either of us had picked it up.

265
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,160
Right?

266
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,121
What?

267
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,625
Yeah.

268
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,631
That clears everything up, right?

269
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,388
If it's as you say, Min-ju,

270
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,516
that explains why In-gyu followed you.

271
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:51,231
It also shows that In-gyu's hearing aid
had nothing to do with the incident.

272
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,776
So, In-gyu is no longer a suspect, right?

273
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:00,699
In-gyu's hearing aid and the CCTV footage
are both irrelevant to the incident,

274
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,160
so there is no physical
or circumstantial evidence.

275
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,748
That means In-gyu is no longer
on the list of suspects, right?

276
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,750
Where did you hear that?

277
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
Right? Yes?

278
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:18,550
Since In-gyu and Si-heon were with you
until right before the incident,

279
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,761
they could be considered
reference witnesses.

280
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,556
But you're right. I don't think In-gyu
could be considered a suspect.

281
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,856
I'm glad it all worked out.

282
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,321
Hey, Jung In-gyu, how does it feel?

283
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,158
How's the taste of freedom
after clearing your name?

284
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,996
It's too late to go back
to school now anyway.

285
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,708
Hey, aren't you guys hungry?

286
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,257
Thanks, Min-ju.

287
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,386
If it wasn't for you,
I would have remained a suspect.

288
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,391
You should be thanking Nam Si-heon,
not me.

289
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,228
He was the one who came running
to my house to ask me to help you.

290
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,731
If it wasn't for Nam Si-heon,
I wouldn't have had a clue.

291
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,194
Forget it.

292
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,655
I only did what I had to do.

293
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,825
I'm sure he would have done the same.

294
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,957
Nope. If you were being framed,
I would've just stood by and watched.

295
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,709
It's none of my business.

296
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,252
Oh, is that so?

297
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,797
The storm has passed, huh?
You were just about to cry earlier.

298
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,132
When?

299
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,217
You were looking at Kwon Min-ju

300
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,637
and were like,
"You don't believe me either."

301
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
Just like this.

302
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,432
I never cried.

303
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,143
The food's here.

304
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,438
Wow, it looks really good.

305
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,358
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

306
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,451
Isn't that too much chili powder?

307
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,745
You need at least this much
to feel the kick.

308
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,373
It might look like I'm just sprinkling it,
but I have a secret method.

309
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,585
Two tablespoons of chili powder.
One tablespoon of vinegar.

310
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,088
That is how you make
the best ever jjajangmyeon.

311
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,555
Can you even taste the sauce like that?

312
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,974
I have my own golden ratio.

313
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,310
Two tablespoons of chili powder,
one tablespoon of vinegar.

314
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,022
That is how you make
the best ever jjajangmyeon.

315
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,150
Wanna try it?

316
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,152
Nope.

317
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,077
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

318
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,259
Why aren't you eating?

319
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,261
Huh? Right.

320
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,894
Wanna hear something funny?

321
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,854
What is it?

322
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,275
What does a king say during a farewell?

323
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,903
Do kings say something special?

324
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,242
Biking.

325
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,215
I've got another one.
What does an almond become when it dies?

326
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,135
An almond dies?

327
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,847
I don't know. What?

328
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,396
Diamond.

329
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,820
So you have a thing for lame jokes.

330
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,239
That's unexpected. How funny.

331
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,160
Why? I thought they were good.
They were brilliant.

332
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,495
I said it was funny.

333
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,126
Forget it. Let's eat.

334
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,912
Do you know
what an almond becomes when it dies?

335
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,122
What? What does it become?

336
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,457
Diamond.

337
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,879
Isn't that funny?

338
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,215
-Yeah, so funny.
-You don't think it's funny?

339
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,799
Of course it wasn't funny.

340
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,677
Han Jun-hee,
you're so heartless these days.

341
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,721
You won't laugh at such a brilliant joke.

342
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,474
Yeon-jun, where did you pick up
such lame dad jokes?

343
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,267
I've got another one. Ready?

344
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,022
Everybody, my boyfriend is addicted
to dad jokes!

345
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,983
Biking? That's so lame.

346
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,956
These days,
she just shuts herself away in her room,

347
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,458
only listening to music
with her earphones on.

348
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,586
And she's skipping so much school.

349
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,133
Then one day, a boy even came
to our house looking for her.

350
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,469
That little brat.

351
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,265
Do you think
she has been influenced by bad kids?

352
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,350
Come on.

353
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,646
Why are you making such a big deal
about her having some close friends?

354
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,315
Don't be so indifferent.

355
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,109
Will you talk to her?

356
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,321
I can't ask her dad to
when we're on the verge of divorce.

357
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,075
I have no one but you right now.

358
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,289
Hey!

359
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,083
A student should be going to school!

360
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,295
Oh, okay.

361
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,381
I'll have a chat with her.

362
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,342
-Happy?
-Fine.

363
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,775
I've got another one.

364
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,987
What does an almond become when it dies?

365
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,698
I don't know. What?

366
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,451
Diamond.

367
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,747
What?

368
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,999
No. No way.

369
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,418
How can I laugh at such a lame joke?

370
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,712
Come on. Where's your pride?

371
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,880
Biking.

372
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,343
Damn it. It is kind of funny.

373
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,221
It's a joke that creeps up on you.

374
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,943
Damn it. Why do I keep thinking about her?

375
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,450
It's driving me crazy.

376
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,958
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

377
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,170
You think everything I say is crazy.

378
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,923
I never said they were crazy.

379
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,096
Then, do you believe what I told you?

380
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,767
Before I answer that,

381
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,687
let me ask you a question.

382
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,819
If you are Han Jun-hee from 2023,

383
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,907
then where's my niece, Kwon Min-ju,
who's supposed to be in that body?

384
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,798
Min-ju is…

385
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,141
Tell him I'm here.

386
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,518
Please.

387
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,147
Tell him I'm here!

388
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,528
What is it?

389
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,407
It's nothing. I thought I heard something.

390
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,079
So, Min-ju is…

391
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,504
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,175
I don't know where she is either.

393
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,513
You don't know…

394
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,224
You don't need to overthink
any of this. Just…

395
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,642
You just need to remember this.

396
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,312
Actually, we both have
the same objective, Uncle.

397
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:36,524
You want your nice
and innocent niece, Min-ju, back.

398
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,904
And I want to return Min-ju's body
to its rightful owner as soon as possible

399
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:45,366
and go back to being myself,
Han Jun-hee, in 2023.

400
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,411
Until then,
we just need to help each other.

401
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,918
So, if I help you go back
to being Han Jun-hee in 2023,

402
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,796
what will you do for me?

403
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,634
I was quite a good student
back when I was in school.

404
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,386
I'll use my smarts from back then
and get Min-ju's grades up.

405
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,265
Then, when Min-ju returns to her own body,
she can get into a good college.

406
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,393
What you're saying is
that you're gonna study hard, right?

407
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,854
And you're not gonna skip school?

408
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,856
That's right. So, Uncle,

409
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,693
please help me.

410
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,531
Fine.

411
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,661
I don't know
whether you're Han Jun-hee or Kwon Min-ju.

412
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:33,248
But since you've promised
to not miss school and study hard,

413
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,877
I'll turn a blind eye this once
and believe you.

414
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,269
JULY MOCK EXAMS

415
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,424
I can get by in the other subjects,

416
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,343
but I really suck at math.

417
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,768
Wait a second.

418
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,356
What if I ruin Min-ju's grades,
and she doesn't get into college?

419
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,568
That can't happen.

420
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,033
-Then, with whom?
-Min-ju?

421
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,993
She won't do it. Why would she?

422
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,453
-You never know.
-Forget it.

423
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,787
-Go ask her!
-Why me?

424
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,000
Min-ju.

425
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,838
We're supposed to play basketball
against another class in PE this Friday.

426
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,839
For hamburgers.

427
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,925
But our class is still a player short.

428
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,678
Yeah, you don't have to be good.
We just need to fill the head count.

429
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,264
It won't take too long.
Can you help us out?

430
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,476
-I'll play.
-See? I told you she wouldn't do it.

431
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,481
Wait a minute.
Did you just say you'd play?

432
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,359
Yeah, I'll play. What's wrong?

433
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,738
I mean, whether it was cleaning,
club activities, or the spring festival,

434
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,449
you never once participated,
but you're going to do this?

435
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:32,951
Yeah.

436
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,495
I'm going to be more proactive
from now on.

437
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,580
Besides, I love basketball.

438
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,123
Thanks for letting me in.

439
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,342
Nam Si-heon!

440
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,177
Jung In-gyu.

441
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,096
He's so good!

442
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,935
Nam Si-heon!

443
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,942
-Wow, he's so good!
-Isn't he great?

444
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,664
Da-hyeon, quick. Go talk to him.

445
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,833
This is refreshing.

446
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,377
Hey, now's your chance, okay?

447
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,380
-Go.
-What are you waiting for? Go.

448
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,343
Nam Si-heon.

449
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,389
This is for you.

450
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,143
Thanks.

451
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,527
Hey, Nam Si-heon.

452
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,988
Tomorrow's Saturday. Got any plans?

453
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:52,905
It's insane!

454
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,323
-You won't believe it!
-Hurry!

455
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,366
It's really insane.

456
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,035
Hey, Han Ji-hun.

457
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,662
What is it? What's insane?

458
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,706
The girls are playing basketball
in the gym,

459
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,332
and apparently, Min-ju is on fire.

460
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,209
Who?

461
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,253
Kwon Min-ju.

462
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,090
Our class was losing in the first half,
but she turned it around with a 3-pointer.

463
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,383
Let's go quickly.

464
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,557
Thanks for the water.

465
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,394
Hey, Nam Si-heon!

466
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,736
Here!

467
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,406
All right!

468
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,659
Hey, defense!

469
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,662
I know I've been saying this a lot
since she woke up…

470
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,333
but is she really Kwon Min-ju?

471
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,877
I don't know what I'm seeing either.

472
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,671
That's a steal!
Hey, did you see that steal?

473
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,799
Since when was she so good at basketball?

474
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,384
She always skipped PE,
saying she was sick.

475
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,554
I don't know about that,
but she's really good right now.

476
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,514
Min-ju!

477
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,273
Well done!

478
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,323
Has Kwon Min-ju always been so pretty?

479
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,909
She always has her head down,
so I never noticed before.

480
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,119
But she's actually pretty.

481
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,204
Min-ju!

482
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,622
Go for it!

483
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,623
You got this!

484
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,418
Come on, Kwon Min-ju!

485
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,591
Kwon Min-ju!

486
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,635
Come on, Kwon Min-ju!

487
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,096
Has Kwon Min-ju always been
that good at sports?

488
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,348
It also feels
like she's gotten prettier lately.

489
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,559
She's always been pretty.

490
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,394
She just never made an effort
to look nice.

491
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,105
Kwon Min-ju!

492
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,898
Go for it, Kwon Min-ju!

493
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,317
Hey, time's almost up.
Hold on a bit longer!

494
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,443
You'll lose your voice.

495
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,655
Hey, you cheer her on too.
If we win, we get burgers.

496
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,949
Hey, Kwon Min-ju,
if I don't get my hamburger…

497
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,409
Come on, Kwon Min-ju!

498
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,827
Kwon Min-ju!

499
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,162
Min-ju!

500
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,212
Nice, Kwon Min-ju!

501
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,311
We should always play together.

502
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,605
Wanna eat something? It's on me.

503
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,815
I guess I'll have pizza toast, then.

504
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,774
-Pizza toast?
-Yup.

505
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,234
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

506
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,527
-Wait here.
-Thanks.

507
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,612
Hey, look at that line.

508
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,655
-Come on. Let's hurry.
-This line is insane.

509
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,541
What?

510
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,212
Why are you two looking at me like that?

511
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,422
You're not Kwon Min-ju, are you?

512
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,715
What?

513
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,431
That's why you're now good at basketball,
and your personality has changed.

514
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,892
Jeez, that's what you meant?

515
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,102
You've changed completely, you know?

516
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,981
In the past, you barely managed
to answer me when I talked to you.

517
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,318
But these days,
it's like you're a whole new person.

518
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,072
Come on. I haven't changed that much.

519
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,490
Si-heon is right.

520
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,409
-I think you've changed a lot too.
-Indeed.

521
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,127
Since you guys seem to have caught on,

522
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,421
I'm just going to tell you honestly.

523
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:48,266
You know how my personality
seems to have changed these days?

524
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,644
It's because
I want my attacker to notice me.

525
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,772
I want that punk to show up
in front of me again.

526
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,944
Kwon Min-ju, are you out of your mind?

527
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,573
You should pray you don't meet them.
Instead, you want them to notice you?

528
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,078
Well, because the old me
was timid and scared,

529
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,582
the attacker probably thought I wouldn't
say anything even if I got my memory back.

530
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,502
But if they realize
my personality has changed,

531
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,671
what do you think will happen?

532
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,259
They'll be even more worried
because I'm going to be unpredictable.

533
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,678
Just then, a rumor starts circulating.

534
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:29,056
"Min-ju has regained
her memories of the attack!"

535
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,184
-No. No way.
-No way.

536
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,397
That might get their attention,
but it puts you in danger. So, no.

537
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,901
I get that you want to find the attacker,
but you can just leave that to the police.

538
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,281
And it's not like the attacker
is watching you every minute of the day.

539
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,700
How would they know you had changed?

540
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,418
The culprit will probably be watching me
from nearby.

541
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,753
How do you know that?

542
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,755
According to Min-ju's memories…

543
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:06,510
Well, from what I remember,
the attacker is a student at our school.

544
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,555
-What?
-Have your memories returned?

545
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,768
Not completely,
but I remember bits here and there.

546
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,979
The person who attacked me that night

547
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,982
was definitely wearing our school uniform.

548
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,109
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

549
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,320
So, what you're saying--

550
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:31,285
What you're saying is that the attacker
sees you every single day.

551
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:32,995
Exactly.

552
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,501
That's why we must catch the attacker
as soon as possible.

553
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:49,178
And that attacker may be connected
to the one who killed Kwon Min-ju in 1998.

554
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:02,066
Guys, the photos from the basketball game
the other day are out.

555
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,150
-Hey!
-Let me see.

556
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,735
-Stop pushing!
-Let me see too.

557
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,822
Write your name on the back of the photos
you want copies of.

558
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,823
How about my number?

559
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,826
-I'm going to get one with Si-heon in it.
-Me too.

560
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,619
Hey, I look good in this one.

561
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,205
Hey, Kwon Min-ju looks good here.

562
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,373
Oh, you're right.

563
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,833
Hey, should we get her photos?

564
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,126
Sure, where's the pen?

565
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,710
Write your name. Not your number.

566
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,129
Let me use your pen.

567
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:31,303
There aren't even any good pictures.
Just a lot of useless photos of Min-ju.

568
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,057
-Aren't you going to get one with Si-heon?
-Why would I?

569
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,352
Everyone knows
that you have a crush on him.

570
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,520
No, I don't!

571
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,023
You scared me. Why are you yelling?

572
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,902
Hey, I'm sorry.

573
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,288
-Man, our teacher took it.
-I know.

574
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,622
Hey, wait right here.

575
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,626
Hey, Kwon Min-ju.

576
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,173
I'm Seo Hyeon-uk from Class Four.

577
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,551
-Hey.
-I saw you playing basketball.

578
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,012
You were really good. Dribble and shoot!

579
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,389
Right.

580
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,391
Thanks.

581
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,186
Here, drink this.

582
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,902
-I got you a straw too.
-Thanks.

583
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,236
Do you like banana milk?

584
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,072
Actually, I'm lactose intolerant.

585
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,158
-Oh, what does that mean?
-Well…

586
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,286
Next time, juice might be better.

587
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,538
-Juice! Orange juice?
-Sure, sounds good.

588
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,582
-Let's go for orange juice next time.
-Okay.

589
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,625
For real? Okay?

590
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,876
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

591
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,960
I'm off! Orange juice!

592
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,462
Hey, did she say yes?

593
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,189
Hey, what the heck?

594
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,234
Hey, someone gave that to me.
Why are you drinking it?

595
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,488
He could be the one who attacked you.

596
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,156
How could you just accept this?

597
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,077
You said the attacker
was a student at our school.

598
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,620
It wasn't him.

599
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,290
How would you know that?
You said you couldn't remember their face.

600
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,252
Still, it's not him.
He doesn't have the face of a criminal.

601
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,336
Face?

602
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,507
-You're a face reader now?
-It's not Seo Hyeon-uk from Class Four.

603
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,553
Look at you. You've even memorized
his name and class? Gosh.

604
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,014
Is he your type?

605
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,438
Well, he is quite cute.

606
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,941
Even though he's not my type.

607
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,613
What is your type?

608
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,948
You want to know my type?

609
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,289
I like someone who is a bit mature.

610
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,917
Someone who takes care of me
without making it obvious

611
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,045
and is always by my side
when I'm having a hard time.

612
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:14,133
Someone who creeps into your life
without knowing it is love at first,

613
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,509
then, all of a sudden…

614
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,806
is already there in your heart.

615
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,608
What? What's with your face?

616
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,320
You're describing that boyfriend
in your dreams right now.

617
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,280
Why are you smirking?

618
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,284
Do you still get butterflies
when you see me

619
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,077
because I remind you of him?

620
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,289
Wow, you're out of your mind. Not at all!

621
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,166
I must be right! You get butterflies!

622
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,084
I don't. I told you I don't!

623
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,629
Butterflies? Don't be ridiculous!

624
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,423
Hey, Kwon Min-ju, I don't mind.

625
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,758
I said I don't!

626
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,470
There wasn't anything I wanted
at the market.

627
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,598
JUNG'S SNACK BAR

628
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,350
I'm back.

629
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,019
Thanks for your hard work, sweetheart.

630
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,354
Come in. Let's eat.

631
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,271
Okay.

632
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,194
Grandma, can you buy me
a tteok-kkochi too?

633
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,654
No.

634
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,657
It's almost time for dinner.
You'll lose your appetite.

635
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,616
Just one.

636
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,118
I said no.

637
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,830
And besides, you had one yesterday
and the day before.

638
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:41,929
Here.

639
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,654
-Hey, Min-ju, let's go together.
-Oh, hey.

640
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,367
We're going to the comic room
after school today.

641
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,619
-Wanna come with us?
-Sure, sounds good.

642
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,082
I just remembered.
I need to go home right away today.

643
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,751
-Why?
-We're getting our report cards today.

644
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,129
I shouldn't get on their nerves.

645
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,590
Oh, report cards?
I completely forgot about that.

646
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,635
Our teacher could just hand them out.

647
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,347
Why does our homeroom teacher always post
our grade rankings on the wall?

648
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,682
Gosh, it's so annoying!

649
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,684
He puts the rankings up on the wall?

650
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:29,601
Yeah.

651
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,353
All of them?

652
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,021
Every single one.

653
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,573
They're up!

654
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,659
He really put them up.

655
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,416
Excuse me.

656
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,252
Kwon Min-ju.

657
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,754
KWON MIN-JU

658
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,674
131st place.

659
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,135
Well, I did screw up in math.

660
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,097
Hey, Jung In-gyu
topped the entire grade again.

661
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,184
-What?
-Hey, Nam Si-heon is fifth.

662
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,395
RESULTS OF JULY 1998 MOCK EXAMS
JUNG IN-GYU, NAM SI-HEON

663
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,981
What? How are Nam Si-heon and Jung In-gyu
so good at studying?

664
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,358
They've both had good grades
since middle school.

665
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,487
I mean, Jung In-gyu only studies,
so I get why he gets good grades.

666
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,364
But how does Nam Si-heon
get such good grades

667
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,075
when he slacks off all semester
and crams just before the exams?

668
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,911
He's just so smart.

669
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,372
I envy him.

670
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,462
I'm so tired.

671
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,674
Why does our teacher only ever ask
for this kind of thing when it's our turn?

672
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,430
Nam Si-heon.

673
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:50,933
Can you…

674
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,936
Yeah?

675
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,146
Hey, you called me. Say something.

676
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,358
Well, the thing is…

677
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,278
Never mind. Carry on
with what you were doing.

678
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,201
Hey, In-gyu,

679
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,162
I saw your rank in the mock exams.
You're really smart.

680
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,540
I got lucky this time.

681
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,333
Hey, you're being too humble.

682
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,503
To be honest, since my accident,

683
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,672
studying math on my own
has been a bit overwhelming.

684
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:25,092
So I was wondering, since we're friends…

685
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,177
Okay, I'll help you.

686
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,305
Huh? I haven't even asked you yet.

687
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,516
You're asking me to help you study, right?

688
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,351
I'll help you with math or whatever.

689
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,269
Really?

690
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,188
In-gyu, you're the best!

691
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,486
Man, why are there so many leaves?

692
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,158
Hey, why don't you study with us too?

693
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,827
I'm good at math.

694
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,038
English, not math.
You need to be good at English.

695
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,666
What was that
about the winter break before senior year?

696
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,629
Hey, this is a secret
that even In-gyu doesn't know.

697
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,673
You can't tell him, okay?

698
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,221
What about the winter break
before senior year?

699
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,099
You got plans for the winter break?

700
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,355
I told Kwon Min-ju

701
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,776
I was going to take some crash courses
at English academies over the break.

702
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,737
But you're good at English.

703
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,655
True.

704
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,034
My grammar is pretty good,
but my listening is weak.

705
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,161
Listening is important for the CSAT.

706
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,247
Yeah, that's right.
That's what I was about to say.

707
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,207
Listening is so important.

708
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,461
Then, can we start
studying together this week?

709
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,130
-Okay.
-Great.

710
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,091
I'll be on my way, then. Okay?

711
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,084
What? I missed.

712
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,968
Huh? We were here first.

713
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,262
Let's just go.

714
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,809
It should be first come, first served.

715
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:39,977
Please move.

716
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,104
Hey, kid.

717
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,356
Leave while I'm still being nice.

718
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,567
I'm not going anywhere.

719
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,737
Why are you getting angry when I'm right?

720
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,740
Seriously! Hey, I said get lost!

721
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,492
You should be leaving.

722
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,953
She's right.

723
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,997
First come, first served.

724
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,584
Damn it.

725
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,839
Leave while I'm still being nice.

726
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,889
Wanna play a round with me?

727
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,480
Man, I died.

728
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,942
Wow, you're really good at this.

729
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,611
That was fun.

730
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,491
Hey, thank you for earlier.

731
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,249
Do you know him?

732
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,919
Yeah, he's the good-looking guy
who gave me tteok-kkochi.

733
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:55,677
Hey! My name is Han Jun-hee.

734
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:59,431
Please remember my name
the next time we meet.

735
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,564
Han Jun-hee?

736
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,406
Korean, math, foreign languages,
social studies, and science.

737
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,575
Not a single decent grade.

738
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,328
You won't get into a university with this.

739
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,371
I'll go to community college.

740
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,083
Do you think you'll magically get a job
by just going there?

741
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:30,337
You still have to study hard there
to get a good job!

742
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,010
I'm home.

743
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,179
You. Where's your report card?

744
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,486
My goodness, 131st?

745
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:01,368
How are your grades so good?

746
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,495
What?

747
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:08,041
Min-ju, I knew you could do it!

748
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:14,965
Sure. Oh, so I did well, right?

749
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,260
Of course! You did amazing!

750
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,220
You were hurt, so I had no expectations.

751
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,390
How have you moved up 100 spots
compared to before you were injured?

752
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,059
What? I moved up 100 spots?

753
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,437
Just how bad was she at studying?

754
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,359
My daughter, I am so very proud of you!

755
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:40,115
See what happens
when you sit at your desk and focus?

756
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,659
I spent a lot of my time at my desk too.

757
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,830
You were probably sitting there
reading comics.

758
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,039
You little brat!

759
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:54,629
No, I still have hope in you, too, my son.

760
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,382
You just haven't given it your all yet.

761
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,383
Right?

762
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,096
I guess so?

763
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,934
Oh, my darling kids.

764
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,562
You bring joy to my life!

765
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,984
I'll work really hard
so you guys can study

766
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,361
without having to worry about money.

767
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,573
You guys do everything you want.

768
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,490
Okay?

769
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,162
Sorry, I have to go.
I'll be late for work.

770
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,288
What?

771
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,540
Wait.

772
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,503
Since your grades have gone up,
I should give you some pocket money.

773
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,881
Pocket money?

774
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,884
There. Buy yourself
whatever you want to eat.

775
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,011
Thank you, Mom.

776
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,847
No need to thank me.
I should be thanking you.

777
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,932
I'm off now.

778
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:27,360
