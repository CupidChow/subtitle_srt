1
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,857
Ever since you left,

2
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,860
people keep walking on eggshells around me

3
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,778
and keep asking me if I'm okay.

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,491
But I'm actually doing really well.

5
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:42,125
I wake up every morning and go to work.

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,463
I even hang out with people,
talking and laughing.

7
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,676
But for some unknown reason,
I struggle to sleep every night.

8
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,514
I wish to fall asleep so that
I can at least see you in my dreams.

9
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,103
Yeon-jun, will you please come
and visit me in my dreams?

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,401
JUN-HEE

11
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,088
INCOMING CALL
JUN-HEE

12
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:54,030
INCOMING CALL
JUN-HEE

13
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,538
Hello?

14
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,832
Hello?

15
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,335
Hello?

16
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,548
Is that you, Yeon-jun?

17
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,722
Excuse me.

18
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,058
Please, just tell me who you are.

19
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,643
Please.

20
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,853
Hello?

21
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,690
Hello?

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,734
Hello?

23
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,204
YEON-JUN

24
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,833
JUN-HEE

25
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,957
A TIME CALLED YOU

26
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,988
You haven't gone to bed yet?

27
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,573
Did something happen?

28
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,176
I saw Jun-hee today.

29
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,514
Don't worry. She didn't see me.

30
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,810
Are you feeling okay?

31
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,605
I sat right behind her on the bus.

32
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,153
She was so close
that I could've touched her.

33
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,448
But there was absolutely nothing
I could do.

34
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,312
YEON-JUN, IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY
A FEW DAYS AGO

35
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:54,979
JUN-HEE

36
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,496
This was the first year
I spent my birthday without you.

37
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
The birthday wish I made this year

38
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,504
was to let me see you again,
just once more.

39
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,215
Yeon-jun.

40
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,718
I miss you.

41
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,349
Even if it's just once…

42
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,519
please come to me.

43
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,080
And just now,

44
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,833
I even got a call from her.

45
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,464
I couldn't say anything anyway,
so I don't even know why I picked it up.

46
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,427
I've done well to hold back so far…

47
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,264
but it's almost in vain.

48
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,407
JUN-HEE

49
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,079
Are you gonna answer?

50
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,180
We must stick to the original plan.

51
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,236
Your call could not be connected.
Please leave a…

52
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,514
FIND MY DEVICE

53
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,017
ID: KOO88
PASSWORD:

54
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,521
INCORRECT ID OR PASSWORD

55
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,661
INCORRECT ID OR PASSWORD

56
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,253
Hey, is the world ending or something?

57
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,420
What's the matter?

58
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,091
So, are you saying that Yeon-jun
answered your call last night?

59
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,050
Yeah.

60
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,635
No, wait. I must be sensible.

61
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,138
Yeah, Jun-hee, you must've been mistaken.

62
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,599
No, it's even in the call log.

63
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,563
But this is really strange, isn't it?

64
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,522
It is indeed.

65
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,691
So I've been thinking.

66
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,570
Maybe someone else
is using Yeon-jun's number now?

67
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,698
Yeah, that's the only thing
that makes sense.

68
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,242
But this is what I don't get.

69
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,495
Sure, let's assume someone else
is using his number now.

70
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,333
Then why was the phone off
all those times I called the number?

71
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,879
So, you're saying that last night was
the first time the phone was turned on?

72
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,758
Hey, you could try doing that thing.

73
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,845
You know, the Find My Device thing you do
when you lose your phone.

74
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,889
I just tried it,
but it required the ID and password.

75
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,308
So I tried everything.

76
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,309
-And?
-None worked.

77
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,519
None of them worked?

78
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,567
Jun-hee, in that case,

79
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,279
there is one person you could ask.

80
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,031
Who?

81
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,179
So, what you're asking now is
for me to hack into it?

82
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,431
Hacking makes it sound so serious.

83
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,349
It sounds scary.

84
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,102
You know, we're simply asking you
to find the ID and password

85
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,022
and track the location
of that person's cell phone.

86
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,774
That's exactly what hacking is.

87
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,903
The act of infiltrating someone's system
without permission and stealing data.

88
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,029
It's not…

89
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,489
My hand!

90
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,783
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,330
It's my boyfriend, not some random person.

92
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,793
So basically, someone
who died a year ago answered his phone.

93
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,379
Why else would we ask you to do it?

94
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,006
Regardless of the situation you're in,

95
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,510
it's someone else's personal information,
so there's nothing I can do.

96
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,594
Please, okay?

97
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,056
If you help me just this once,
I'll owe you one.

98
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,685
I mean, I get where you're coming from.

99
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:33,234
Ms. Han, I'm someone who believes
personal data must be strictly protected.

100
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,155
So I'd never do it without the consent
of the other party.

101
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,157
I'll get going, then.

102
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,117
Hold it there.

103
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,288
Didn't you say
your girlfriend loves staycations?

104
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,417
Na-eun, can you remind me what I have?

105
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
A voucher for a five-star hotel?

106
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,338
A room with an amazing view.

107
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,141
Five stars?

108
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,768
-Change this.
-I'll fix the report.

109
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,398
Company resources shouldn't be used
for personal matters like this.

110
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,900
I get it, so just hurry up and find it.

111
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,658
Done.

112
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,910
Cafe 27?

113
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,413
Why would it be there?

114
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,252
Hey, Ms. Han?

115
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,296
I've checked the payment history,

116
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,759
and the person who's been paying
the phone bills is called Nam Si-heon.

117
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,429
Nam Si-heon?

118
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,389
NAM SI-HEON

119
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,742
Hello, can I help with your order?

120
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,953
Would it be possible to see the owner?

121
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:12,208
He's out of town today,
and I'm not sure when he'll be back.

122
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,960
May I ask why you want to see him?

123
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,342
-We'll wait until he returns, then.
-If you'd like.

124
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,136
Could we please get two iced Americanos?

125
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,554
Sure.

126
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,685
-I'd like to ask one more thing.
-Yes?

127
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,523
Is there a Nam Si-heon
among the customers or staff?

128
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,399
Nam Si-heon?

129
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,903
No, I've never heard that name before.

130
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,114
Well, I just started
working here recently.

131
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,909
It's probably best for you
to ask the boss when he returns.

132
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,244
Okay.

133
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,129
Gosh, why isn't he coming?

134
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,553
Jun-hee, I'm really sorry,
but I really have to get going now.

135
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,555
Off you go.

136
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,723
-Call me. I'm really sorry.
-Thanks.

137
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,768
-Call me.
-See you.

138
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,610
Please enjoy.

139
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,653
Thank you.

140
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,037
I'm afraid we'll be closing now.

141
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,831
Oh, I see.

142
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,167
Actually…

143
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,381
when the owner returns,
please ask him to call me,

144
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,341
regardless of how late it is.

145
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,137
-Okay, I will.
-Thank you.

146
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,886
That customer was looking
for Nam Si-heon just now.

147
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,681
I said I didn't know him,
just like you asked.

148
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,601
Thanks. You did well.

149
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,146
But who is this woman
you're going to such lengths to avoid?

150
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,256
Han Jun-hee.

151
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,509
Oh? Hi, Chan-yeong.

152
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,179
-What's up?
-I was just passing by.

153
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,181
I'll be on my way.

154
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,684
Jun-hee.

155
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,855
Want to grab a beer?

156
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,797
I have a question.

157
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,549
What is it?

158
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,470
What made you decide
to become a furniture designer?

159
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,222
Was it your childhood dream?

160
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,726
When I was young, I didn't dream about
doing anything in particular.

161
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,146
In high school, a friend told me

162
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,481
that I shouldn't be cocky
about my good grades.

163
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,651
That I should learn a skill
because you never know what will happen.

164
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,487
What a funny thing to say.

165
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,324
That friend told me
I was good with my hands,

166
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,993
so I could pursue this as a career.

167
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,247
So, praise is Koo Yeon-jun's weak spot?

168
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,836
I was especially susceptible
to the praise that friend gave me.

169
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,215
Ta-da!

170
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,762
Jun-hee.

171
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,015
When you leave, take this chair with you.

172
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:42,311
Because, after all,
everything Yeon-jun made belongs to you.

173
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,106
Next time.

174
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,610
I'll take it next time
when I bring my car.

175
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,115
And whenever you think of Yeon-jun,
feel free to drop by.

176
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,658
The door code is still the same.

177
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,079
You came here again today
because of Yeon-jun, didn't you?

178
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,507
I had a weird dream.

179
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:19,848
In my dream, I saw a high school student
who looked exactly like Yeon-jun.

180
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:25,020
But despite looking exactly the same,
their personalities were polar opposites.

181
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:30,734
I knew in my head that he wasn't Yeon-jun,
but my heart kept getting confused.

182
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,946
Maybe it's because the dream was so vivid.

183
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm confused about how much of that
was a dream and how much was…

184
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,412
real.

185
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,252
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

186
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,005
Well, you said your insomnia
has been bad lately.

187
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,383
You're under a lot of stress.

188
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,427
That's why you're having weird dreams
when you fall asleep.

189
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,806
I guess you're right.

190
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,233
Ms. Han Jun-hee?

191
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,194
Please come in.

192
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,494
How is your insomnia these days?

193
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,207
I think you've been taking medicine
for about three months now.

194
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,544
I get a few hours of sleep
on the days I take medicine,

195
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,964
but I don't feel like I'm sleeping deeply.

196
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,341
Do you have any new symptoms?

197
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,970
Maybe it's because I can't sleep,

198
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,892
but sometimes, I can't tell the difference
between dreams and real life.

199
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,853
Someone I saw in my dreams

200
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:53,525
felt like they were a person
living in real life.

201
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,237
By any chance,
did that person in your dreams

202
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,033
resemble your deceased boyfriend?

203
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,499
Yes.

204
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,963
Dreams normally reflect
a person's reality and thoughts.

205
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:21,553
Since your deceased boyfriend
occupies most of your day,

206
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,600
it's only natural for someone
related to him to appear in your dreams.

207
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:29,937
I see.

208
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,616
Hello?

209
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
Yes. Hello.

210
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,416
I heard you waited for me quite a while
that day. May I ask what it was about?

211
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,842
I wanted to see you the other day because

212
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,431
I was actually trying to find the person
using my dead boyfriend's number.

213
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,643
The person's name was Nam Si-heon,

214
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,731
and this was the last place
where the cell phone was turned on.

215
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,359
I see.

216
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,778
I don't know if it's just a coincidence,

217
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,823
but everything keeps
bringing me back to this café.

218
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,618
Did something else happen?

219
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,503
If I say this, you might think
it's ridiculous or even be offended.

220
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,422
But a few days ago,

221
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,217
I had a dream where I was your niece.

222
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:52,144
Are you saying
that you were Min-ju in your dreams?

223
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,354
I know it sounds weird.

224
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,108
A dream is just a dream,
and it's probably all in my head.

225
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:02,237
But it's all a bit much
to accept it as a mere coincidence.

226
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,455
Let me tell you
something ridiculous as well.

227
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,667
When Min-ju was alive,
she once told me something.

228
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,503
That she wasn't Kwon Min-ju

229
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,380
but Han Jun-hee.

230
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,803
At the time, I just laughed it off
because I thought she was being silly.

231
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,141
I mean, kids fantasize a lot
and have vivid imaginations at that age,

232
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,101
so I thought she was just making it up.

233
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,731
But when you came to my café
a few days ago…

234
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,362
I remembered the things Min-ju said
all those years ago.

235
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:57,209
I set this aside to give to you
if you ever came back.

236
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,585
What is this doing here?

237
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,940
The entire time I was listening
to In-gyu tell me how he felt,

238
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,193
I was thinking I wasn't the one
who should be hearing this.

239
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,489
In-gyu was definitely talking about us,

240
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,492
but it felt like I was hearing him talk
about someone else.

241
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,578
This…

242
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,875
this is what I wrote in my dream.

243
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,793
It's my handwriting too.

244
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,633
How can something I wrote in my dreams
now be right in front of me?

245
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,807
What?

246
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,563
Did I really go back to 1998?

247
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,123
AUGUST 29, 1998
THAT BOY IS KOO YEON-JUN

248
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,883
What on earth is going on here?

249
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,075
I need to go back now.

250
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,826
I need to go back and see Yeon-jun--

251
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,913
Wait a second.

252
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,042
How did I go back to 1998
in the first place?

253
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,006
Right.

254
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,175
That cassette player.

255
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,337
Please.

256
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,364
When the lights outside the window

257
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,827
Start dimming one by one

258
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,166
I write a letter to the sky

259
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:12,047
You left me for someone else

260
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,842
But I still cannot forget you

261
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,512
So I gather my tears

262
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,601
And send them off to the sky

263
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,688
Though I'm not your love

264
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,942
If you look for me

265
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:38,239
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

266
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,746
Why did you turn it off?
I was listening to it.

267
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,999
What do you mean you were listening?
You were nodding off.

268
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,797
You should try other songs too.
Stop listening to the same song.

269
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,802
Uncle, did the police happen to come by?

270
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,762
The police? Why would they?

271
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,852
Hello. We are
from the Noksan Police Station.

272
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,899
You must be here
to investigate Min-ju's case.

273
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,026
Yes. How have you been?

274
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,986
Wait a minute.

275
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,488
Are you here to show me a photo

276
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,990
of the hearing aid found
at the crime scene?

277
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,327
How did you know that?

278
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,163
So, do you know
who the hearing aid belongs to?

279
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,420
What's the date today?

280
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,880
It's July 9th.

281
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,094
Did you say today was July 9th, 1998?

282
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,847
Goodness, what on earth
are you talking about?

283
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,391
Of course it's 1998.

284
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,690
This wasn't a dream.

285
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,609
It was real.

286
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,536
It's 1998 now,
and I'm in the body of Kwon Min-ju.

287
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,248
This is all reality, so that means…

288
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,509
-Uncle, I'll be back in a while.
-Where are you going? They're…

289
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,937
Why do you like
time-travel movies so much?

290
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,734
They're fun. You can go back to the past
and change the future.

291
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:44,574
Then, if you had the ability
to travel through time

292
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:48,453
and could go back to the past
or into the future, where would you go?

293
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,039
I don't need to know about the future.

294
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,957
Why?

295
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:03,384
Because no matter what happens,
I'll always be by your side.

296
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,809
So, what point in the past

297
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,228
do you want to go back to?

298
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,650
Whenever it is,
I'd go back to a time before I met you.

299
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:26,825
There's something I really want
to tell myself before I meet you.

300
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,999
It doesn't matter
whether it's a day, a month,

301
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,377
or even a year before I meet you.

302
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,757
I just want to meet myself
before I meet you and tell him this.

303
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,218
"Someday,

304
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,221
you're going to meet this girl."

305
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,642
"And you're going to end up loving her

306
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,645
so much."

307
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,232
"When you meet her,

308
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,193
grab her hand and never let go,

309
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,445
no matter what."

310
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,451
I'd tell this to myself from the past,
who hasn't met you yet.

311
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:16,207
You? If you could go back to the past,
where would you go?

312
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,752
Me?

313
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,383
What? What is it?

314
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,260
I'd go back

315
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,221
to meet you.

316
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,726
I'd find you and tell you this.

317
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,947
"I am the one and only person
in the future

318
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,326
that you will like and love
for the rest of your life."

319
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,303
So pretty.

320
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,181
What?

321
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,059
What are you doing here, Kwon Min-ju?

322
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,604
Are you crying?

323
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,521
Huh?

324
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,652
-No.
-You came just in time.

325
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,988
Who do you think is hotter,
S.E.S. or Fin.K.L?

326
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,825
Both groups are so hot, so I can't decide.

327
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,869
S.E.S. look like fairies,

328
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,456
and Fin.K.L are just so cute.
Totally cute.

329
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,794
If I had to pick one,

330
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,963
Sung Yu-ri of Fin.K.L
would be perfect for me.

331
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,760
Are you picking potential girlfriends
from girl groups now?

332
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,553
Yes, why?

333
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,306
I went through all that
to meet someone like him?

334
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,432
What?

335
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,185
Go and have fun with your girlfriends!

336
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,188
What? Hey.

337
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,691
Hey!

338
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,110
Someone like Sung Yu-ri
would make the best girlfriend?

339
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,444
What's so good about her?

340
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,489
I came all the way
from 2023 to 1998 to see that--

341
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,784
Hang on. That's right.

342
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,495
This is 1998.

343
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,456
If it's 1998 right now,

344
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,627
no matter how much
Nam Si-heon looks like Koo Yeon-jun…

345
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,091
He's not the right age.

346
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,220
Wait. That means
if Nam Si-heon isn't Koo Yeon-jun…

347
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,514
"That boy is Koo Yeon-jun."

348
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,017
What does that mean?

349
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,187
Kwon Min-ju.

350
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,774
Hey, Kwon Min-ju!

351
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,153
Didn't you come to see me?

352
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,698
Why were you crying back there?

353
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,951
What if I was crying? Why do you care?

354
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,829
What's up with her?

355
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,748
Hey!

356
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,791
Kwon Min-ju!

357
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,759
Kwon Min-ju, where--

358
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,970
Wait a minute, Uncle.
I need to check something right away.

359
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,447
It's gone.

360
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,240
What is?

361
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,454
Does it mean Kwon Min-ju of this period
hasn't met Koo Yeon-jun yet?

362
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,124
Then, just when
does she meet Koo Yeon-jun?

363
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:51,881
Min-ju.

364
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,803
According to what Min-ju's uncle
told me at the time,

365
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,722
Kwon Min-ju died in 1998.

366
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,019
There are only a few months left
until she dies, then.

367
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,106
It'd only make sense for her
to know Yeon-jun right about now.

368
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:16,239
Then, am I going to meet the Koo Yeon-jun
of 1998 for the first time as Kwon Min-ju?

369
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,617
No, wait.

370
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,120
How old would Yeon-jun be right now?

371
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,830
Eleven years old.

372
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,875
What am I supposed to do
with an 11-year-old boy?

373
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,798
Oh boy. She's completely in her own world.

374
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,593
Min-ju, snap out of it.

375
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,765
-Hey, aren't you going to work?
-Gosh, what is all this?

376
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,852
Why on earth have I come to 1998?

377
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,111
Okay, I'll let you be.

378
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,696
Rest up, okay?

379
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,201
JUNG'S SNACK BAR

380
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,579
I'm back from the deliveries.

381
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,791
Good job, my baby boy.

382
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,003
Hey, you should be studying,

383
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:16,048
so I'm really sorry
I keep sending you out on deliveries.

384
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:20,636
Grandma, cramming before the exam
is a must if you want to get good grades.

385
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,513
Goodness me.

386
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:24,974
Goodness.

387
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,435
My goodness.

388
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,020
My knees.

389
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,735
Your knees are hurting,
so please go home first.

390
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,613
Si-heon and I will wrap things up.

391
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,823
What? Are you sure?

392
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,328
Okay, I've done the dishes already.

393
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:49,790
So, you guys just need to make sure
you lock up properly, okay?

394
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,917
-Okay.
-Sure.

395
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,127
I'm off, then.

396
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,962
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

397
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,100
Jung In-gyu.

398
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,395
You wanna go and see Min-ju
after we're done here?

399
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,398
Why?

400
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,692
It looked like she was crying earlier.

401
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,070
Crying? Why?

402
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,532
I don't know. I think she came to see me,
but she was crying.

403
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,662
I asked why she was crying,
but she left without answering.

404
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,290
So let's go see her
and ask why she was crying earlier

405
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,210
and if something bad happened today.

406
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,970
I'll go see Min-ju by myself.

407
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,098
-No need for you to go too.
-Why?

408
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,898
I want to be the one by Min-ju's side
when she's having a hard time.

409
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,317
Not you.

410
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,364
You seem to be a bit too interested
in Min-ju these days.

411
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,451
Hey, that's not fair.

412
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,663
You told me to be nice to her
in the first place.

413
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,039
Well,

414
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,585
that was because I didn't have
the confidence to talk to her myself.

415
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,422
But things are different now.

416
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,174
I even told her I liked her.

417
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,178
You told her you liked her?

418
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,139
Yeah.

419
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,391
That's great.

420
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,019
So, what did she say?

421
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,855
She said nothing.

422
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,572
Well, to be honest,
I stopped her from answering.

423
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,746
I didn't tell her my feelings,
expecting her to like me back now.

424
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,665
So I can wait for as long as it takes.

425
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,389
Min-ju.

426
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,391
Huh?

427
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,269
In-gyu, what brings you here?

428
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,230
I'm here to take you home.

429
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,235
Okay.

430
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,707
Did something happen today?

431
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,668
Sorry? Like what?

432
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,798
It's just that you look
like you have a lot on your mind.

433
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,259
Oh, do I?

434
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,388
If you're having a hard time,
you can tell me.

435
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,139
I…

436
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,812
I'm here for you, whatever it is.

437
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,939
Thank you.

438
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,941
But I'm really fine.

439
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,375
I won't give up on Min-ju.

440
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,669
I'm going to keep taking care of her.

441
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,464
I'm going to wait
until she forgets you and likes me.

442
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,717
If I keep trying…

443
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,305
Min-ju will feel the same way
about me one day too.

444
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,184
You hoped things would work out
for me and Min-ju, right?

445
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,938
Then, from now on,
stay away from her as much as possible.

446
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,319
Because if Min-ju keeps seeing you,
it'll be hard for her to get over you.

447
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,824
I'm asking you this as a friend.

448
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,870
Jung In-gyu, you bastard.

449
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,665
How can I say anything
when you look so pitiful?

450
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,928
What are you doing here, Kwon Min-ju?

451
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,434
Why did she have to cry
and worry me like that?

452
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,979
Damn it!

453
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,031
I don't know what's going on.

454
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,953
Yeon-jun isn't even here,
so what am I doing here?

455
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,168
I mean, I have to go to work.
I must go back as soon as--

456
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,587
What?

457
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,634
Oh no.

458
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,803
How do I get back?

459
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,616
-Hye-mi.
-Yeah?

460
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,411
-Isn't Min-ju here yet?
-Min-ju? I don't think so.

461
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,355
Kwon Min-ju!

462
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,241
Wait, why am I still here?

463
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,742
Precisely.

464
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,662
Why are you still here
instead of at school?

465
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,666
Your teacher called to ask why you
didn't come to school without telling him.

466
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,334
It's not supposed to be like this.

467
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,420
I'm supposed to go back
when I listen to the song.

468
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,715
Do you think now
is the right time to listen to music?

469
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,593
I never woke you up,
but you were never late.

470
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,844
What's gotten into you?

471
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,347
Mom, now is not the time
for me to go to school.

472
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,939
-What's wrong with your eyes?
-What?

473
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,526
Your eyes are all bloodshot.
Did you have trouble sleeping?

474
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,447
Was it because of the pain?
Should we go see the doctor?

475
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,074
-No, it's not like that--
-Let's go see the doctor.

476
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,076
Mom, I said it's not like that!

477
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,290
Mom, I'll explain everything later,
so can't you just leave me alone for now?

478
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,212
Min-ju, you've never gotten annoyed at me

479
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,758
like this before.

480
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,094
You were so sweet and quiet.

481
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,429
I'm sorry. Really.

482
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,099
Mom, I wasn't annoyed at you.
I just haven't been able to sleep well.

483
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,894
So I'm going to get some sleep now

484
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:11,690
and go back to being your nice,
kind daughter, Kwon Min-ju, okay?

485
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,408
-Hey, pass the ball!
-Over here, In-gyu!

486
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,368
Hey, Jung In-gyu.

487
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,497
What the--

488
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,627
Why didn't you pass it to me? I was open.

489
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,004
Really? I didn't see you.

490
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,301
-Nice one!
-Okay, nice shot.

491
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,638
Jung In-gyu.

492
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,764
Hey, In-gyu, over here.

493
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,849
Okay.

494
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,941
Hey, In-gyu! Over here!

495
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,827
Nice!

496
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,412
Hey, what are you doing?

497
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,414
Why'd you take the ball? I'm on your team.

498
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,374
Are you ignoring me?

499
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,417
Why did you take it?

500
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,210
Sorry, I didn't see you.

501
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:14,795
Okay?

502
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,632
As if you didn't see me!

503
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,676
You wanna start something?

504
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,261
What did I ever do to you?

505
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,595
Come on, guys. Cut it out.

506
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,223
Bring it on! You wanted me
to start something? You think I won't?

507
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,225
-Hey, stop it.
-Let go of me!

508
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,476
Hey, just calm down!

509
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,895
Don't forget to hand in
your homework next class.

510
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,733
Don't come crying to me for forgiveness
after handing it in late, okay?

511
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,984
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, done.

512
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,318
Attention, bow!

513
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,361
Thank you.

514
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,362
Good job today.

515
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,789
Nam Si-heon!

516
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,338
Are you going to Min-ju?

517
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,757
Seems like you know already.

518
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,258
-Why are you going?
-Because I want to.

519
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,509
-Hey!
-What?

520
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,390
I don't want to talk to a guy
who'd ditch a friend over a girl.

521
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,143
From now on, I'll do what I want.

522
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:15,856
Jung In-gyu.

523
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,658
Why on earth am I still stuck in 1998?

524
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,667
Aren't I supposed to go back to 2023
when I listen to this song?

525
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,012
Please, just this once, okay?

526
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,814
But I'm so sleepy.

527
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,236
Let's just take a quick nap.

528
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,649
Nam Si-heon, how far do we have to go?

529
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,192
We're almost there.

530
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,694
Wait a minute.

531
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,740
What are we doing here?

532
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,161
It's pretty.

533
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,997
I really have something to say,
so let's go.

534
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,459
If you had something to say,
you could've said it in front of my house.

535
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,502
I mean, did you have to say it out here?

536
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,212
It better be important.

537
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,132
For God's sake, you talk so much.
Stop wasting time complaining.

538
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,303
Okay, let's go.

539
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,014
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

540
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,517
So, what is it you wanted to tell me?

541
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,273
-Why were you crying yesterday?
-What?

542
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,610
Why were you crying yesterday?

543
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,241
Did you come all the way here
just to ask me that?

544
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,995
Hey, I'm tired
and really sleepy right now.

545
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,039
Did you really come all this way
just to ask that?

546
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,125
There's something else
I want to say as well.

547
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,960
Something that's on my mind.

548
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:08,922
Something on your mind?

549
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,341
Si-heon, look,

550
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,178
if it's not a matter of life and death,
can we talk about it later?

551
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,223
Come on, Kwon Min-ju! Just hear me out.

552
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:22,352
If I don't get it out now,
I think my head might explode.

553
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,148
Okay.

554
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,909
So, the thing is, I've been thinking.

555
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,165
In the beginning, we only became friends
because of Jung In-gyu.

556
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,959
Since In-gyu liked you,

557
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:51,006
I was trying to help him,
but we became good friends too, right?

558
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:52,799
I suppose.

559
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,928
But once we got to know each other more,

560
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:01,308
I think I forgot why we became friends
in the first place.

561
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:10,067
I mean, you're the girl In-gyu likes,
and I'm supposed to be helping him.

562
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,029
But I forgot about that.

563
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,657
Anyway, I think
we need to clear things up.

564
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,493
I'm not saying we can't be friends.

565
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,037
How do I put this? Setting priorities?

566
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,581
I'm saying
we should look at what's important.

567
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:31,838
I'm going to think of you
as Jung In-gyu's friend.

568
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:37,052
So you should treat me
as Jung In-gyu's friend too.

569
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,432
So we'd be

570
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,269
friends of a friend.

571
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,691
Yeah. That's how it should be.

572
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,821
We need to be very clear with each other.

573
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,656
That's the only way

574
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,910
you, me, and In-gyu can all be comfortable
around each other, you know?

575
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,623
Do you get where I'm coming from--

576
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,669
Hey, how can you sleep when I'm talking?

577
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,967
You're just full-on sleeping.

578
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,218
Hey, Kwon Min-ju.

579
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,929
Did you hear what I said?

580
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,514
Hey, Kwon Min-ju.

581
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,273
All right, just sleep.

582
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,693
It's probably better this way.

583
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,240
Because as long as you're asleep,
I can say whatever I want.

584
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,596
When you came to see me yesterday…

585
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,225
when I saw you crying…

586
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,604
I felt weird.

587
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:18,111
It kind of felt like
a part of my heart was aching too.

588
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,826
It was the same at the hospital.

589
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,746
When you had just woken up,

590
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,916
and you grabbed onto me and cried.

591
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,919
When I see you cry,

592
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,380
it makes me want to cry too.

593
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,220
No matter what I'm doing…

594
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,099
I keep thinking of how you cried.

595
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,562
And it drives me crazy.

596
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,151
So, Min-ju, please tell me…

597
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,571
why you were crying.

598
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,320
You? If you could go back to the past,
where would you go?

599
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,282
Me?

600
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,495
What? What is it?

601
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,330
I'd go back

602
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,166
to meet you.

603
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,837
I'd find you and tell you this.

604
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,174
"I am the one and only person
in the future

605
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,344
that you will like and love
for the rest of your life."

606
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,101
You don't have to tell me.

607
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,104
Even if you don't tell me…

608
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,858
I'll recognize you.

609
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,737
Wherever and however we meet…

610
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,490
I'll know the moment I see you.

611
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,330
Just like I did in this life.

612
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,653
You're definitely not Yeon-jun.

613
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:10,367
So, why do you
have the same face and voice

614
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,163
and look exactly the same
even when you're sleeping?

615
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:53,423
