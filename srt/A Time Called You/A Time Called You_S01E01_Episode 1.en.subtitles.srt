1
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,574
When the lights outside the window

2
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,412
Start dimming one by one

3
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,709
I write a letter to the sky

4
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:48,214
You left me for someone else

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,885
But I still cannot forget you

6
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,430
So I gather my tears

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,351
And send them off to the sky

8
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,981
Though I'm not your love…

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,318
Are you going to stare at her all day?

10
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,906
Hey.

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,700
Hello.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,258
Where can I find the rock albums?

13
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,929
Where are the rock albums?

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,681
Pardon?

15
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,353
The rock section is over there.

16
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,192
Aren't you in our class?

17
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,905
-Yes.
-So, why do you speak formally?

18
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,201
How do you know me?

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,704
You sit in the back of my row,
so you always collect my exam papers.

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,623
Oh, right.

21
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,757
It's a nice song.

22
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,551
Whose song is it?

23
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,887
-Seo Ji-won.
-Who?

24
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,306
Seo…

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,058
What did you say?

26
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,311
It's…

27
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,439
Hey.

28
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,695
It's "Gather My Tears"
by Seo Ji-won, right?

29
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,072
Seo Ji-won?

30
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,449
You don't know him?

31
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,659
No, I don't.

32
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,994
What do you know?

33
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,997
That I don't know Seo Ji-won.

34
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,874
You're all talk.

35
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,002
I like it. I should buy the album.

36
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,919
Where is it?

37
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,648
I can't find any of his CDs or cassettes.

38
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,443
Oh, hold on.

39
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,242
It looks like they're all sold out.

40
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,660
Really?

41
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,954
Oh well. That's too bad.

42
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,293
Why don't you leave your name and number?

43
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,464
I can call you when it's back in stock.

44
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,758
Right, I guess we could do that.

45
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,605
Hey, In-gyu. Can you pick it up
for me later on? Give her your number.

46
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,285
You're buying it. Leave your number.

47
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,787
But--

48
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,885
Is this your pager number?

49
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,138
-Yeah, call me when they come in.
-Okay.

50
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,523
A TIME CALLED YOU

51
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,276
Ms. Han!

52
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,236
-Oh, good morning.
-Good morning.

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,195
Hi, Seo-woo.

54
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,530
Hey, look! "Libra."

55
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,824
"You'll be very lucky
with money this week."

56
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,867
Zodiac horoscope?

57
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,328
Why do you read it daily?
You say it's never right.

58
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,873
Hey, it still feels good
if it says something good once in a while.

59
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,333
-Want me to check yours?
-Nope.

60
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,044
"This week, you will meet an unexpected…"

61
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,921
Hey, it says you'll meet someone new.

62
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm always either
at the office or at home.

63
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,761
So, where could I possibly meet
this new person?

64
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,221
Then how about this, Jun-hee?

65
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,181
What?

66
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,433
What would you like
for your upcoming birthday?

67
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,435
-Birthday?
-Yeah.

68
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,687
We're too old to celebrate it.

69
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,647
All the more reason to celebrate it.

70
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,276
Come on. And besides,
this is your first birthday alone--

71
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,779
I mean…

72
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,947
What I mean is…

73
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,117
Think about whatever you might want
for your birthday. Anything.

74
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,119
Okay, fine. We'll be late for the meeting.

75
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,329
-Right?
-Let's get ready!

76
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,456
-Let's go to the meeting!
-Let's go!

77
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,126
Yes, we will start a collaboration
with Lee Do-ha,

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,921
the makeup artist
and social media influencer,

79
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,632
on the day the app is updated
with the new functions.

80
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,175
Thank you.

81
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,721
Okay. Let's do that, then.

82
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,932
Oh, and what was that thing again?

83
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,768
The facial recognition accuracy.
How is that going?

84
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh, why don't we take a look
at the presentation?

85
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,945
-I'm leaving early today.
-Bye!

86
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,407
Ms. Han. You have a date
with a guy tonight, don't you?

87
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,867
Wow. How did you know?

88
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,827
Right?

89
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,415
I mean, you're all dressed up.
You look different today!

90
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,628
The man I'm meeting today
is really handsome.

91
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,630
So I dressed up a bit.

92
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,841
Really? I'm so jealous.

93
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
-Well, I'm off.
-Okay.

94
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,635
Bye.

95
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,803
-Hey, wait.
-Bye!

96
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,929
Bye!

97
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,180
You got this, Ms. Han!

98
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,141
Good luck!

99
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,019
She got over it a lot faster
than I expected.

100
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,980
What do you mean?

101
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:20,857
I mean Ms. Han.

102
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,484
After what happened
with her boyfriend last year,

103
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,069
she seemed to be struggling.

104
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,238
But she seems totally fine now.

105
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,533
What happened?
Did Ms. Han break up with her boyfriend?

106
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,330
You're new here,
so you probably don't know, Seul-gi.

107
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,957
Know what?

108
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,251
It'd be great
if she had really forgotten him

109
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,253
and was going out to meet another guy.

110
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,131
What am I missing?

111
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,591
It's better you don't know.

112
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,384
-Why won't anyone…
-Let's finish up.

113
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,346
My dear brothers and sisters.

114
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,808
We have gathered here today

115
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,562
to mourn the passing of our fellow brother
in Christ, Andrew Koo Yeon-jun.

116
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,814
But for Christians,

117
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,445
death is not the end
but the beginning of eternal life.

118
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,616
So we have hope that we will be
reunited again in the Lord.

119
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,669
Hey, you're here.

120
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,056
We'll only be apart for just one year.

121
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,184
Let's focus on what we each need to do
during our time apart

122
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,185
for just one year.

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,812
Yeon-jun.

124
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,357
You'll be okay with me going, right?

125
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,363
Everyone wants to work
at the New York branch.

126
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,616
No matter what I say…

127
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,704
you won't change your mind, will you?

128
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,417
No.

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,348
Then how about I take a year off work

130
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,226
and go to New York with you?

131
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,691
Jun-hee.

132
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:32,154
I can't bear to be apart from you
for a single week, let alone a year.

133
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,864
No.

134
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,367
I won't do it.

135
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,995
Brothers and sisters.

136
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,789
"Now, if we died with Christ,

137
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,627
we believe
that we will also live with him."

138
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,602
Jun-hee!

139
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,692
Jun-hee!

140
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,574
Why are you leaving so soon?

141
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,119
You didn't even say hi.

142
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,079
Oh…

143
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,711
In-yeong, I don't know why I came here.

144
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,006
Yeon-jun might still be alive.

145
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,800
So, what if his name was
on the passenger list?

146
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,970
They haven't even discovered his body.

147
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,306
He could have miraculously survived.

148
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,225
Until I see it with my own eyes,

149
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,312
I don't think
I should believe that he's dead.

150
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,369
I also still find it hard to accept
that Yeon-jun is no longer with us.

151
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,916
Whenever I hear people talk
about the plane crash lately on TV

152
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,586
because it's the one-year anniversary,

153
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,255
it feels like…

154
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,343
I'm being suffocated.

155
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,353
But, Jun-hee…

156
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,066
I'm worried about you.

157
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,569
I know how hard it is for you

158
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,156
to accept his death.

159
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,713
You never even got to wear
the ring that Yeon-jun gave you.

160
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,006
I'm so sorry.

161
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,305
A ring?

162
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,974
Didn't you receive the ring?

163
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,229
Yeon-jun told me that he was going
to hide the ring in the birthday present

164
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:14,859
he was going to give you last year
just before you left for New York.

165
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,832
It's your birthday.

166
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,252
Even though we've been fighting,
we should still celebrate it.

167
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,842
So, you were making my present
at the workshop the other day?

168
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah.

169
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,222
I wanted to surprise you.
I was so scared that you'd find out.

170
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,975
I was wondering
what you were hiding from me.

171
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,106
-This is a peony, isn't it?
-Yeah.

172
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,108
It's your favorite flower.

173
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,026
Yeah.

174
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,779
It's beautiful.

175
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,739
Take a look inside.

176
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,285
I put a lot of care into every detail.

177
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,595
So, if you look inside a little closer--

178
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,805
Yeon-jun.

179
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,683
I need to ask you for a favor.

180
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,603
Sure. What is it?

181
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:44,031
Don't abandon everything here
to follow me to New York to be with me.

182
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,370
I'm only saying this
because I know you could come later on.

183
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,836
How can you be okay with…

184
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,464
living so far apart?

185
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,596
Yeon-jun, we're going to be together
for a long time.

186
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,139
We have to save up a lot more

187
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,893
to buy an apartment in Seoul
after we're married, even with a loan.

188
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,436
Is that all you care about?

189
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,355
If that's not important, what is?

190
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,275
For me, every single moment
that I spend with you is important!

191
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,987
Being together is what's important!
Who cares where we live?

192
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,572
I care!

193
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,158
I'm going to save money
so we can have a stable start.

194
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,453
And I'll make sure we never argue
about money while we're together!

195
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,081
We'll live together
for the rest of our lives,

196
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,958
so one year is really short!

197
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,042
What if it isn't?

198
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,131
What if we thought it'd be for a moment…

199
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,718
but we end up parting ways forever?

200
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,430
Are you that unsure about us?

201
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,645
Do you really think
we'll break up that easily?

202
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,651
Or do you think that I'll change…

203
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,740
during our time apart?

204
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,659
Jun-hee, that's not what I meant.

205
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,202
It's almost time for my flight.

206
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,815
Wait!

207
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,109
Wait!

208
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,339
What are you doing here?

209
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,760
The bus…

210
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,313
Hop on the back.

211
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,566
Hop on so you won't be late.

212
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,697
Is it okay to take scooters to school?

213
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,701
Of course not.
We'll have to hide them when we get there.

214
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,120
Come on. Hurry up.

215
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,999
Hey, In-gyu.

216
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,918
You give her a ride.

217
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,713
Me?

218
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,842
Mine's a piece of junk.

219
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,638
See you.

220
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,828
Let's go.

221
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,621
Okay.

222
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,013
Hey! Hurry up! You're gonna be late!

223
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,890
-Hey! Hurry!
-Hurry up.

224
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,601
Wait, sir!

225
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,649
We rode our scooters,
but we're still late!

226
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,819
Stop right there!

227
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,866
So, you rode scooters here?

228
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,662
And now
you're climbing over the gate, right?

229
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,606
Hey! Get up!

230
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,692
All of you!

231
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,741
You punks. I'm your homeroom teacher
and the director of student affairs.

232
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,785
Not only were you late,

233
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,539
but as if that wasn't enough,
you even rode your scooters to school.

234
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,584
Have you guys lost your minds?

235
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,502
I'm sorry.

236
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,004
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

237
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,090
Hey, what class are you in?

238
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,433
-I'm in Class Three.
-What?

239
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,561
Class Three.

240
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,439
She's in our class too.

241
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,526
Oh, I… Of course I know you.

242
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,571
You sit in the back,
next to the window to the hallway.

243
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,574
You know where she sits
but not who she is, right?

244
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,078
You little brat. Did you just laugh?

245
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,956
-Hey, do another lap.
-But, sir…

246
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,125
Don't argue with me. Another lap.

247
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:16,960
Damn it.

248
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,795
Damn it.

249
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,523
Ms. Han Jun-hee, open your eyes.

250
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,857
Okay.

251
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,947
What the heck?

252
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,991
-This isn't my toothbrush. I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

253
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,036
Still, it'll bother you.
I'll buy you a new one after work.

254
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,913
It's really okay.

255
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,751
Jun-hee, if you're really in love,
you can even share a toothbrush.

256
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,671
Why would you use that to measure love?

257
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,342
Wait a minute.
You've used my toothbrush, haven't you?

258
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,260
Right?

259
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,222
-Just a few times when I was drunk.
-Hey!

260
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,350
I'll prepare breakfast, so be quick.

261
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,439
Hey, Koo Yeon-jun, how many times
have you used my toothbrush?

262
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,606
Tell me the truth.

263
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,668
A YEAR AGO, A PLANE CRASHED
DUE TO A MECHANICAL DEFECT

264
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,969
MEMORIAL CEREMONY LATER TODAY
FOR THE 183 VICTIMS

265
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,275
COMMEMORATIVE MESSAGES
FOR SKAI FLIGHT 6809 CRASH ANNIVERSARY

266
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,406
One year ago today,
SKAI Airlines Flight 6809,

267
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,076
which was en route to New York
from Incheon International Airport,

268
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,038
crashed due to a mechanical problem
with the aircraft,

269
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,873
tragically killing everyone on board.

270
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,503
What is more tragic
is that among the 183 victims,

271
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,713
some of the bodies
are yet to be recovered.

272
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,590
The one-year anniversary--

273
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,733
I can send it
after revising this part, right, Ms. Han?

274
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,903
Talk to Sang-ho about it,
and keep me in the loop.

275
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,821
Can't you just approve it already?

276
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,539
MS. HAN JUN-HEE
WE WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY

277
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,332
HERE'S A 20% COUPON
TO CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY

278
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,258
Ms. Han Jun-hee.

279
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,013
-Did you forget your birthday again?
-Yeah.

280
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,142
Happy birthday.

281
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:06,648
-Today was my birthday?
-You always put work before your birthday.

282
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,823
I keep forgetting my birthday
because you take care of it like this.

283
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,669
-I bet you skipped dinner?
-Yeah.

284
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,590
What is this?

285
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,341
Open it.

286
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,555
This is from that really expensive place.

287
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,640
Yes. You said
you wanted to try it last time.

288
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,393
My dear Koo Yeon-jun.

289
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,272
Whoever ends up living with me
must be one lucky girl.

290
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,114
Are you gonna continue
to make my birthdays special?

291
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,658
If you keep this up,

292
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,952
I'll have high expectations
for every birthday.

293
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,621
You should.

294
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,874
Ms. Han Jun-hee, I'll make them special
for the rest of our lives.

295
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,673
There.

296
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,427
Now, make a wish and blow out the candle.

297
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,228
Ms. Han.

298
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,189
Oh. Yes?

299
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,941
This was addressed to you.

300
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,071
Who sent this?

301
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,783
I just picked it up at reception.

302
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,118
You must be so happy, Ms. Han!

303
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,873
Isn't this from a guy
who has a secret crush on you?

304
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,752
I'm right, aren't I?

305
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,587
I'm certain.

306
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,132
When will I receive something like that?

307
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,479
Excuse me. Who dropped off
the flower basket for me?

308
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,690
Oh, some man brought it.

309
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,358
What man? What did he look like?

310
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,026
He just left.

311
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,611
That's him.

312
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,992
Wait!

313
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,970
-Hello?
-Hi, Jun-hee. It's me.

314
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,598
-Let me call you back shortly, In-yeong.
-I'll make it quick.

315
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,560
I registered Yeon-jun's death today.

316
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,772
I thought you should know.

317
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,896
Hi, Chan-yeong.

318
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,608
Right now?

319
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,497
Does returning here after such a long time
bring back memories?

320
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,672
Oh, I saw you in that magazine article.

321
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,134
The headline was really impressive.
What did it say again?

322
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,678
It said… Right.

323
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:12,477
"Oh Chan-yeong, an artist who creates
sensuous objets d'Art and spaces."

324
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,436
That's right.

325
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,565
Your friend is an artist that…
I'm kidding. I'm hardly an artist.

326
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,487
The title of "artist"
suits Yeon-jun much better.

327
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,584
I couldn't bring myself to touch
Yeon-jun's belongings,

328
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,337
but I found this
while cleaning the office drawers.

329
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:05,947
Yeon-jun.

330
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,283
Did you paint this?

331
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,744
Yeah.

332
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,329
Who is this?

333
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,332
-A friend.
-A friend?

334
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,171
What kind of friend?

335
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,882
Just a friend.

336
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,677
Hey. The way you avoid the question
is suspicious.

337
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,930
-Was she your first love?
-Maybe?

338
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,103
Don't even try to laugh it off like that.

339
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,104
Tell me now!

340
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,480
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

341
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,024
Come on! Who is it?

342
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,901
Who? Who is it, Yeon-jun?

343
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,028
Did Yeon-jun…

344
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:53,453
ever tell you who the girl
in the painting is, by any chance?

345
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,538
No. I just always assumed it was you.

346
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,668
He must have framed this painting
because it was meaningful to him.

347
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,171
I'm so curious.

348
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,589
Jun-hee.

349
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,342
What will we do with you?

350
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,761
You still have so many questions
for Yeon-jun.

351
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,799
WEEKEND PICNIC

352
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,101
YEON-JUN

353
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,812
IN-YEONG CALLED ME TODAY
AND TOLD ME SHE WANTED TO SEE ME

354
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,648
ON THE BUS TODAY,
I SAW A GUY WITH A BOUQUET

355
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,566
I WONDER IF HE WAS GOING TO GIVE IT
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND

356
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,866
I'm at the café we used to visit often.

357
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:20,707
The owner asked me
why I don't come here with you these days.

358
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,001
He asked if we had an argument.

359
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,798
Yeon-jun, I miss you a lot,
especially today.

360
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,184
Yeon-jun.

361
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,770
Today's my birthday.

362
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,735
You told me you'd always make
my birthdays special, no matter what.

363
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,196
There are only a few minutes left
until it passes.

364
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,490
Aren't you going to wish me
a happy birthday?

365
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,410
I'll be waiting.

366
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,489
NO POSTS YET

367
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,587
Yeon-jun.

368
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,966
That's definitely Yeon-jun.

369
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,845
But that girl isn't me.

370
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,516
And who's that other guy?

371
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:08,523
It's called oxidation
when a substance gains oxygen.

372
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:13,486
And it's called reduction
when a substance loses oxygen.

373
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,695
You remember, right?

374
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:20,493
So, is it called oxidation or reduction
when a substance loses hydrogen?

375
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,953
Anyone?

376
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,373
I can't believe you guys.

377
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,333
What is the date today?

378
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,793
Number 16.

379
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,546
Who's number 16?

380
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,553
So, what is it called
when a substance loses hydrogen?

381
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,308
It's okay if you get it wrong.
It's one or the other.

382
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,061
It's oxidation.

383
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,481
Good. That's right. It's oxidation.

384
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,525
Which would make this reduction.

385
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,576
Today, we're going to use magnesium

386
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,620
to perform a redox experiment.

387
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:09,667
Take the materials from this table
and form groups of three.

388
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,087
Do the experiment and hand in a report.
Do you understand?

389
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,005
Yes.

390
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,341
Come on. Get to it!

391
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,676
Hey, let's work together.

392
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,014
-What? Oxidation?
-I think I read about it in the book.

393
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,443
You shouldn't put that there.

394
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,991
Do you mind if we join you?

395
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,618
Sorry?

396
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,370
Sure.

397
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,288
Hey.

398
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,750
Get on with it, then.
You two can do it without me, right?

399
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,968
I think this beaker
contains a copper sulfate solution.

400
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,475
Then this must be magnesium.

401
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,565
-You want me to do it?
-Yeah.

402
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,796
I would like to know who you are

403
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,383
and why you sent me this picture.

404
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,928
Could we speak over the phone or meet up?

405
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,619
Who sent you this picture?

406
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,747
I checked the profile,
but there was no activity.

407
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,749
I also sent a DM, but there was no reply.

408
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,502
It's you standing next to him.

409
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,671
That girl isn't me.

410
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,424
I don't remember taking a photo like this.

411
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,469
Are you sure? Maybe you don't remember
because it was a long time ago.

412
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,221
She looks just like you.

413
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,474
I've never had a hairstyle like that,
and I've never dressed like that.

414
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,685
Aside from everything else,
this guy on the left,

415
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,729
I don't even know who he is.

416
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,939
Then, what?

417
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,817
Oh, Sang-ho. Would you be able to find out

418
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,820
whether this picture was posted
on other social media accounts

419
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,904
or message boards?

420
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,742
That's easy.

421
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:53,622
Let's select the image and search for it.

422
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,918
Let's see. The picture…

423
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,919
Oh, here it is.

424
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,716
I see. It was posted on the message board
of a website called "School Days" in 2008.

425
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,967
"School Days"?

426
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,512
Yes, a website where you could find
former classmates. It was popular.

427
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:14,185
But they shut down the website,
so I can't find any more information.

428
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,437
Actually,

429
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:22,193
this picture seems to be a scanned file
of a photo taken with a film camera.

430
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,988
Considering the picture quality
and overall vibe, you're right.

431
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,500
Could this girl have been…

432
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,712
Yeon-jun's first love?

433
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,861
I know Nam Si-heon's number now.

434
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,703
NAM SI-HEON

435
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,541
What was your name again?

436
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,170
Kwon

437
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,006
Min-ju.

438
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,842
Kwon Min-ju?

439
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:42,148
Though I'm not your love

440
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,485
If you look for me

441
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:52,533
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

442
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:57,121
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

443
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,250
I'll just continue to love you

444
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:07,047
Dear, I'm going to wait

445
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:14,054
When my letter of tears reaches the sky

446
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,854
Someday, you will come back

447
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:26,484
To me

448
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:36,076
I will believe it and gather my tears

449
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:52,510
Though I'm not your love

450
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,722
If you look for me

451
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:02,770
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

452
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,733
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

453
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:11,487
I'll just continue to love you

454
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:17,326
Dear, I'm going to wait

455
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:24,124
When my letter of tears reaches the sky

456
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:32,049
Someday, you will come back

457
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:36,679
To me

458
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,855
Dear, I'm going to wait

459
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:53,612
When my letter of tears reaches the sky

460
00:42:55,948 --> 00:43:01,704
Someday, you will come back

461
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:06,208
To me

462
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:16,885
I will believe it and gather my tears

463
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,848
Why can't we just get rid
of this piece of junk?

464
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,308
Let's buy a new car.

465
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,685
Why would you get rid of a car
that runs fine?

466
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,314
Who in this world drives a car
with a cassette player these days?

467
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,650
That's the reason I drive this car.

468
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,570
Ms. Han Jun-hee,
you don't know the charm of vintage cars.

469
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,075
Charm? Whatever.
I'll scrap this car while you're sleeping.

470
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,334
See? This car has another ten years in it.

471
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:52,648
