1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,051
What I wanted to tell you is…

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,058
I like you.

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,731
I like you a lot.

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,222
A TIME CALLED YOU

5
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,088
Min-ju.

6
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,506
Hey, In-gyu.

7
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,803
If you're looking into the photos,
I'll come.

8
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,764
It's dangerous for you to go alone.

9
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,810
Okay.

10
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,979
-Hello.
-Welcome.

11
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,898
Have you ever seen

12
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,609
a male high school student
taking photos around here?

13
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,528
-Photos?
-Well…

14
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,988
Photos like these.

15
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,408
No, I haven't seen anyone.

16
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,911
He's asking
if you've seen a student taking photos.

17
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:00,995
I haven't.

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,997
-How about you?
-I don't know anything.

19
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,582
We haven't seen anyone.

20
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,502
Okay, thank you.

21
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,464
Please take a good look.

22
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,636
These weren't printed here.

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,725
HAPPINESS PHOTO STUDIO

24
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,188
In-gyu.

25
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,069
Si-heon not telling you about moving away

26
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,613
wasn't because he didn't think
of you as a friend

27
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,949
but because he considered you
a very close friend.

28
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,661
He said he didn't want to see you sad

29
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,205
during the little time you guys have left.

30
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,500
I just happened to find out
while talking about something--

31
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,335
I don't want to talk about Si-heon.

32
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,006
I don't want you
to make excuses for him either.

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,386
I understand. I won't talk about it, then.

34
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,349
Min-ju.

35
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,228
If…

36
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,024
you still like Si-heon,

37
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,067
you can go out with him.

38
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,321
-What?
-You guys don't have much time left.

39
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,282
So if you two like each other,

40
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,535
you and Si-heon should spend time together

41
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,372
instead of spending time with me
to be nice to me.

42
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,753
I've never spent time with you
just to be nice to you.

43
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,298
You are a good friend to me. And Si-heon…

44
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
Both you and Si-heon are good friends.

45
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,644
Sure, it's true
that I used to like Si-heon before.

46
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,312
Not sure why Kwon Min-ju…

47
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,941
I mean, I'm not sure
why I told Si-heon I liked him,

48
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,692
causing a situation like this--

49
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,527
Stop talking to me like that.

50
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,946
I'm not Si-heon.

51
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,744
Don't talk to me like you're no longer
the Kwon Min-ju I used to know.

52
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,292
You may have been different from others
in the past, but I liked you that way.

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,837
I liked you, Kwon Min-ju,
for who you were.

54
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,803
But you're acting like this now
to become someone that Si-heon likes.

55
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,182
You are you.

56
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,529
In-gyu.

57
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,413
There's something
I need to tell both you and Nam Si-heon.

58
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,296
What do you wanna tell us?

59
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,339
Nam Si-heon, come have a seat.

60
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,532
I told you about my dream, didn't I?

61
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,996
The one where I was Han Jun-hee
instead of Kwon Min-ju.

62
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,664
I remember that.

63
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,375
That wasn't a dream. It was all real.

64
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,462
I'm Han Jun-hee.

65
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,673
I'm not Kwon Min-ju,
but Han Jun-hee from 2023.

66
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,677
I'm not pretending
my personality has changed for Si-heon.

67
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,014
And, Nam Si-heon,
you don't like me right now

68
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,640
because I'm not Kwon Min-ju.

69
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,394
So there's no reason for you two
to be fighting because of me.

70
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,314
Okay? Got it?

71
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,201
Oh, right.

72
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,461
Here's proof I'm not Kwon Min-ju.
Take a look at this.

73
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,929
Min-ju's handwriting in the earlier pages
and mine in the later pages.

74
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,729
Can you tell the difference?

75
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,525
The handwriting is actually different.

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,368
So you're saying
that you came to 1998 from 2023.

77
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,537
How's that possible?

78
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,457
Right after the first anniversary
of my boyfriend's death,

79
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,960
someone sent me
a cassette player and tape.

80
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:03,172
I fell asleep listening to it,
and when I woke up, I was here.

81
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,216
So what you're saying is

82
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,886
that you fell asleep listening to music,
and when you woke up, it was 1998.

83
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,850
And you woke up in the body
of Kwon Min-ju, a total stranger.

84
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,185
That's right.

85
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,438
Do you understand what I'm saying?

86
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,405
I do.

87
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,491
Actually, I…

88
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,120
knew everything already.

89
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,166
You're not the only one
who went through it.

90
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,460
To be honest…

91
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,131
I am not Nam Si-heon.

92
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,723
I was sent by them

93
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,267
from a very distant future.

94
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,229
By who?

95
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,315
Who sent you?

96
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,570
Skynet.

97
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,572
What? Who?

98
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,994
I'm the Terminator sent
by Skynet to kill John Connor.

99
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,626
Hey, you weren't sent to kill John Connor.

100
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,086
You were sent to kill his mother,
Sarah Connor.

101
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,421
Hey, same difference.

102
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,716
They were trying to kill Sarah Connor
to prevent the birth of John Connor.

103
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,511
I guess they all boil down
to the same thing.

104
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,554
-Exactly.
-Hey!

105
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,016
Come on! That's not what's important here!

106
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,100
Kwon Min-ju.

107
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,811
What you said is even stranger
than a sci-fi film.

108
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,941
Listening to music, then waking up in 1998
in someone else's body?

109
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,486
I know it sounds absurd.

110
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,531
It's the truth,
whether you guys believe it or not.

111
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,577
And if the attacker isn't caught quickly,
Kwon Min-ju will be murdered soon.

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,704
Murdered?

113
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,790
What do you mean?
Why would you be murdered?

114
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:06,837
I heard in 2023
that someone would murder Kwon Min-ju

115
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,589
on October 13, 1998.

116
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,510
So if we don't catch the attacker quickly,
Kwon Min-ju will be killed,

117
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,137
or the me trapped
inside her body will be killed.

118
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,432
Something will happen
that cannot be undone.

119
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,567
Fine. It's up to you guys
whether you believe me or not.

120
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,319
It's not my problem
if you regret it when Min-ju dies.

121
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,449
Hey, Kwon Min-ju.

122
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,995
I think I know what you're talking about.

123
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,630
Do you really get what I'm saying?

124
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,716
Yeah, I'm telling you, I get it.

125
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,472
You're doing this on purpose
to get Jung In-gyu and me to reconcile.

126
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,102
I agree.

127
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,236
I mean, I literally told you
about every single thing.

128
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,531
What am I supposed to do now
if you don't believe me?

129
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,658
Whatever. I give up.

130
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,455
Hey, Kwon Min-ju. Tell us more.

131
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,707
We haven't reconciled yet.

132
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,708
Min-ju.

133
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,300
That really hits the spot.

134
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,720
What do you think?

135
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,847
Knowing her personality,

136
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,184
she was obviously making it up
so things wouldn't be awkward between us.

137
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,353
You said you agreed, didn't you?

138
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,855
That's probably it, right?

139
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:55,863
But

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,575
the expression on her face
when she told us the story back there,

141
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,538
it didn't look
like she was making something up.

142
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,543
She actually looked serious.

143
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,924
And she has changed a lot.

144
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,719
We've both been thinking it was strange.

145
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,390
Her personality has changed,
and so has the way she talks.

146
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,183
Even the way she smiles.

147
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,103
On top of that, her eyes

148
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,980
are now different.

149
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,777
The way she looks at me,

150
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,570
somehow…

151
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,871
Just saying they've changed.

152
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,625
Do you think
there's any truth to her story?

153
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,048
Well, assuming Min-ju
was telling the truth,

154
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:02,763
then it would explain why she's no longer
the Min-ju we used to know.

155
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,353
And it would also explain
why she doesn't give me butterflies

156
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,689
as much as she used to.

157
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,359
What did you say?

158
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,237
I don't feel the same way
about Min-ju anymore,

159
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,243
so I wasn't really angry
when you told me you liked her.

160
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey, so you aren't mad at me?

161
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,539
No.

162
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,624
You should've told me.

163
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,545
I felt really guilty toward you
after what happened.

164
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,257
That's not the problem right now.

165
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,676
You're leaving soon.
What's the point in liking her?

166
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,681
Well, now that you brought it up,

167
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,977
me not telling you I'm moving away

168
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,564
wasn't because I didn't think of you
as a friend…

169
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,107
Well…

170
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,319
Well, I mean…

171
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,156
Anyway, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

172
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,033
So I--

173
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,911
If you're gonna apologize, forget it.

174
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,456
What are you doing? Are you copying me?

175
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,208
Hey, that's my move.

176
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:14,919
Says who?

177
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,838
-Hey, are you done eating?
-Hey!

178
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,089
You're done, right?

179
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,266
Is all this really necessary?

180
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
Kwon Min-ju is the one
who made me like this.

181
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,108
I thought when I sent the photos,
she'd be scared and behave,

182
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,361
but it didn't faze her at all.

183
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,658
Even so, I think she'll be really hurt
if everyone sees these pictures.

184
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,910
We must go this far
so she gets the message

185
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,120
and stops hanging out with Nam Si-heon.

186
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,125
What? You guys don't want to do this?

187
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,920
-No--
-If that's the case, just go.

188
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,257
No. Let's put them up.

189
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,771
-No one's here, right? Close it.
-Let's go.

190
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,482
-Seriously.
-Let's go.

191
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,945
-It's scary.
-Honestly.

192
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,072
Hey, wait a second.

193
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,867
I must be nervous. My stomach hurts.

194
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,077
-Let me go to the bathroom.
-Make it quick.

195
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,873
I'm just a bit scared.
Will someone come with me?

196
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,961
I'll go with you. I needed to go too.

197
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,505
Wait here. Be right back.

198
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,757
-We'll be right back.
-Honestly.

199
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,261
-Why didn't you go earlier?
-I didn't need to.

200
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,349
Huh? What the heck?

201
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,685
What? Did she go?

202
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,647
She must've gotten pissed and left.

203
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,608
Byeon Da-hyeon is really hot-headed.

204
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,693
Hey, it's not like this is the first time.

205
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,904
Let's just go.

206
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,614
We can make it up to her tomorrow.

207
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,531
All right. Let's go.

208
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,785
-Gosh, it's scary.
-Tell me about it.

209
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,287
Why did Byeon Da-hyeon
want to come to school so late?

210
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,789
Feels like a ghost will appear.

211
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,500
Don't even talk about it.
It might really appear.

212
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,304
Byeon Da-hyeon, you're here early.

213
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,227
Are you sleeping?

214
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,442
Hey.

215
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,359
What's going on?

216
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,448
-Isn't that blood?
-What is it?

217
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,536
Did someone in our class die?

218
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,873
Su-jin, what is it? Did something happen?

219
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,958
Byeon Da-hyeon is dead.

220
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,877
What?

221
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,464
But the way she was found
was a bit strange, so they're saying

222
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,215
it could be a murder.

223
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,307
Apparently, Hye-mi was the first person
to find Byeon Da-hyeon.

224
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,685
She must've been really shocked.
What should we do?

225
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:53,697
Can you tell me what Da-hyeon looked like
when you first saw her?

226
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,703
I came into the classroom,

227
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,665
and Da-hyeon was lying face down.

228
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,711
At first, I thought she was sleeping,
so I called her.

229
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,713
But she didn't respond, so I looked…

230
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:18,263
and there was a pool of blood
under her chair.

231
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,974
I see.

232
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,689
Do you remember seeing anyone
on your way to the classroom?

233
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,984
Or seeing anyone coming out
of your classroom?

234
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,570
I don't think I saw anyone.

235
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,490
I left home early this morning,

236
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,368
so I thought
I was the first one to get to school.

237
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,329
-Sir.
-Yes?

238
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:49,378
If the culprit stuck around until then
and watched me,

239
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,006
doesn't that mean I'm also in danger now?

240
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,424
-No.
-Sir.

241
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,760
It's okay. You'll be fine. Calm down.

242
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,470
What do I do now?

243
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,888
-I'm scared.
-Calm down.

244
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,931
Let's stop here.

245
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,522
Oh my God.

246
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,732
Is she crying now?

247
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,650
Don't cry.

248
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,780
-Let's go, Ji-hui.
-Oh no.

249
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,323
Let's get out of here.

250
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm telling you I'm right.

251
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,711
Kwon Min-ju killed Da-hyeon.

252
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,548
You saw how the photos we put up
were all gone.

253
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,968
Who else would've taken them down
besides Kwon Min-ju?

254
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,889
Kwon Min-ju must've been pissed
after seeing the photos

255
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,098
and killed Da-hyeon.

256
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,853
So that means we're going to be next.

257
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,981
But it's not like we put them up
because we wanted to.

258
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,568
Hold on. What are you guys talking about?

259
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,236
What photos?

260
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,574
Hey, Lee. Are you finished over there?

261
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,491
All clear.

262
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,624
Hey, what's going on?
Has something happened?

263
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,875
No classes today.

264
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,543
-They told us to go home.
-Why?

265
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,464
A Junior girl in Class Three died.

266
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,007
It's so scary.

267
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,928
Class Three? Who in Class Three?

268
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,180
Dunno her name. They said she was killed.

269
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,599
The whole school is in chaos.

270
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,984
Guys, go back. Classes are canceled today.

271
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,946
Go home. You guys in the back too.

272
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,245
Nam Si-heon!

273
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,996
Hey, Jung In-gyu.

274
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,666
Apparently, a girl in our class died.

275
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,711
It's not Min-ju.

276
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,924
It's not Kwon Min-ju?

277
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,801
I saw her come to school earlier.

278
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,678
Then who died?

279
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,515
Byeon Da-hyeon.

280
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,060
What? What do you mean Byeon Da-hyeon?

281
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,438
Nam Si-heon, Jung In-gyu.

282
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,899
Kwon Min-ju, are you okay?

283
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,819
Did you hear about Byeon Da-hyeon?

284
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,780
Yes. Actually, I have something
to tell you about that.

285
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,408
But I can't tell you here.

286
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,328
They told everyone to go home anyway.

287
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,122
Let's go to my house.

288
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,582
Okay.

289
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,970
We had it all wrong.

290
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:51,518
It wasn't my attacker who sent me
those photos, but Byeon Da-hyeon.

291
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,272
Why would she take photos of you
and send them to you?

292
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,399
She was annoyed to see us getting close,

293
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,067
so she sent me those photos.

294
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,652
To scare me.

295
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,696
How did you find that out?

296
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,656
Ji Yong-seon and Park Ji-hui told me.

297
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,993
But because I didn't get scared,

298
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,829
she secretly took photos
of me getting changed for PE.

299
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:15,167
And last night, they put dozens
of those photos up in the classroom.

300
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,217
Well…

301
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,015
I think Byeon Da-hyeon's death
has something to do with me.

302
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,099
How so?

303
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,644
When people got to class in the morning,
the photos were already gone.

304
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,356
No way Byeon Da-hyeon took them down.

305
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,610
That means someone else came
and took down all the photos.

306
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,070
That's right.

307
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,197
So, if we had to guess,

308
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,241
while Byeon Da-hyeon and the others
were putting up the photos,

309
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,536
the culprit hid, watched them,
and then took them all down.

310
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,331
Then killed Byeon Da-hyeon.

311
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,337
So, could it be that your attacker

312
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,091
and whoever killed Byeon Da-hyeon
are the same person?

313
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,468
Actually, that's what I thought too.

314
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,179
But the more you think about it,
the less it makes sense.

315
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,557
My attacker almost killed me that day.

316
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,727
But this time,
the culprit took down my photos

317
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,398
as if they were taking revenge
on my behalf.

318
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,405
Back to square one, then.

319
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,783
We'll only know after the investigation.

320
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,750
Byeon Da-hyeon's case might be
completely unconnected to yours.

321
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,127
So don't worry too much.

322
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,383
Are you leaving?

323
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,808
Yeah, there's no need to worry right now.

324
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,978
You must've had a big shock
this morning, so get some rest.

325
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,980
-I'll just see In-gyu off.
-Okay.

326
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,577
About the culprit killing Byeon Da-hyeon
for trying to harm Min-ju

327
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,036
and taking the photos down…

328
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,790
-Maybe this is what they were thinking.
-What?

329
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,959
If I were the culprit…

330
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,756
"No one but me can harass
or mess with Kwon Min-ju."

331
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,093
"Because she belongs to me forever."

332
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,096
"So it's okay for me to harm her,

333
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,559
but I can never tolerate
anyone else messing with her."

334
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,191
Hypothetically.

335
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,776
You scared me.

336
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,070
What crazy person would murder

337
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,823
just because they didn't like
others touching what's theirs?

338
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,910
Right? I was just using my imagination.

339
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,246
-I'm off.
-Okay, see you.

340
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,269
Nam Si-heon,
did you make all these yourself?

341
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,271
Yeah.

342
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,359
You're quite good with your hands.
You could pursue it as a career.

343
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,695
-I could?
-Yeah, you're better than professionals.

344
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,573
I just do it as a hobby.

345
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,117
Don't be cocky about your good grades.

346
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,620
Learn a skill
because you never know what will happen.

347
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,458
In 2023, it'll be difficult to get a job
even if you graduate from a university.

348
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,834
It's a tough world to live in.

349
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,257
If you say so, Ms. Han Jun-hee.

350
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,973
What? You're Han Jun-hee, aren't you?

351
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,727
Didn't you think

352
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,939
I was just saying crazy things
to get you and In-gyu to reconcile?

353
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,072
At first, I did, but I don't anymore.

354
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,198
Why not?

355
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,618
Your story seems
too consistent to be made up.

356
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,749
And unlike before,
the look in your eyes is…

357
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,672
What about it?

358
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,053
Never mind. Anyway,

359
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,682
because you keep repeating it,
I'm starting to believe you.

360
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,270
And I've become curious

361
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,732
about how Han Jun-hee lived in 2023.

362
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,194
You said that you were successful at work

363
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,655
and had many friends as well, right?

364
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,866
What else?

365
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,702
Why? So, you can tease me about it?

366
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,995
That's not it.

367
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,291
I just want to know more
about what the person I like,

368
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,168
Han Jun-hee, is like.

369
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:16,676
Did you even realize
how casually you just told me again

370
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,347
that you liked me?

371
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,143
You're right.

372
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,321
-Hey, let me bring something to drink.
-Okay.

373
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,824
-What would you like?
-Oh, anything is fine.

374
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,242
Anything.

375
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,954
Han Jun-hee.

376
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,043
You can't continue to have butterflies
for Nam Si-heon.

377
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,185
He's even good at drawing.

378
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,014
Yeon-jun.

379
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,392
Did you paint this?

380
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,812
Yeah.

381
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,397
Who is it?

382
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,400
-A friend.
-A friend?

383
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,239
What kind of a friend?

384
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,949
Just a friend.

385
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,745
Hey. The way you avoid the question
is suspicious.

386
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,998
-Was she your first love?
-Maybe.

387
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,208
Why?

388
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,962
Why is this painting here?

389
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,632
Why?

390
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,141
Hey, Han Jun-hee. I have orange and grape.

391
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,392
Pick one.

392
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,520
Hey, what's up with you?

393
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,901
Han Jun-hee. What's wrong with you?

394
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,781
You were Koo Yeon-jun all along.

395
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,909
From the beginning.

396
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,996
You were Koo Yeon-jun
from the very beginning.

397
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,833
What?

398
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,715
Jun-hee!

399
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,426
Hey, Han Jun-hee!

400
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,763
Hey, come on! Wake up!

401
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,142
Hey, I really thought
something happened to you.

402
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,811
Are you okay?

403
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,440
Na-eun.

404
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,153
What are you doing here?

405
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,572
I called you so many times,
but you didn't answer.

406
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,782
That's why I came.

407
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,757
Hey, what's up with you?

408
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,887
-Hey, where are you going?
-Sorry, I'll explain later.

409
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,597
Hey!

410
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,278
What brings you here?

411
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,405
Nam Si-heon is Koo Yeon-jun, right?

412
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,367
Just like how I went
into Min-ju's body in 1998,

413
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,370
Yeon-jun also went
into Nam Si-heon's body.

414
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,998
Right?

415
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,295
Please tell me.

416
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,841
You know everything already.

417
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,510
Don't you?

418
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,141
I'll answer you.

419
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,435
Jun-hee.

420
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,534
Are you…

421
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,583
Are you Nam Si-heon…

422
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,046
or Koo Yeon-jun?

423
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,431
Who the hell are you?

424
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:04,857
Jun-hee.

425
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:13,032
YEAR 2002

426
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,703
Hey, we'll win again, won't we?

427
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,163
-Our national team…
-They're amazing.

428
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm really proud of them.

429
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,084
Let's go, Korea!

430
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:27,964
Here you are.

431
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,758
How long are you planning to stay?

432
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,678
For a week. So until next Wednesday.

433
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,971
Okay, I understand.

434
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,558
Please fill out this form.

435
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,855
It wasn't easy to book a hotel room.

436
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,691
The World Cup is taking place,
so it'll be the same everywhere else.

437
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,609
You must be returning from overseas.

438
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,404
Yes, I'm studying in the States.

439
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,074
The whole nation is celebrating,
so you've come at a good time.

440
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,713
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

441
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,725
VISITATION APPLICATION
DETAINEE: JUNG IN-GYU

442
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,483
RELATIONSHIP TO DETAINEE: FRIEND

443
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,539
The inmate declined to see you.

444
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,833
He said he has no intention
of seeing you in the future,

445
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,376
so you shouldn't come back.

446
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,093
Could you please tell me how I can
deposit money into his inmate account?

447
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,139
Yeah, don't worry. I'll be back in time.

448
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,851
Sorry?

449
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,609
I didn't get to see In-gyu.

450
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,779
Yeah.

451
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,285
I'll look after myself, so don't worry.

452
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,746
Take care of yourself too, Mom.

453
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,749
Okay.

454
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:39,155
I HOPE THIS MUSIC TAKES YOU
TO YOUR HAPPIEST MOMENT

455
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,646
Nam Si-heon, put it down!

456
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,314
-Hey, put it down!
-Why?

457
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,365
When the lights outside the window

458
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,119
Start dimming one by one

459
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,166
I write a letter to the sky…

460
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,503
Hurry, run! Nam Si-heon!

461
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,255
Let's go!

462
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,717
But I still cannot forget you

463
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,554
So I gather my tears

464
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,559
And send them off to the sky

465
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,647
Though I'm not your love

466
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,943
If you look for me

467
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:04,991
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

468
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,620
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

469
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,708
I'll just continue to love you

470
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:19,505
Dear, I'm going to wait

471
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:26,387
When my letter of tears reaches the sky

472
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:34,312
Someday, you'll come back

473
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,983
To me

474
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,281
I'll believe it

475
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,535
And gather my tears

476
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,485
Though I'm not your love

477
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,781
If you look for me

478
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:14,787
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

479
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:19,583
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

480
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,504
I'll just continue to love you

481
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:29,760
Dear, I'm going to wait…

482
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,262
-Move.
-He was in a car accident.

483
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,431
He's been unconscious the whole way here.

484
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,932
-His vitals?
-Seventy over fifty.

485
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:35,933
One, two.

486
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,852
-Prepare the defibrillator.
-Yes, Doctor.

487
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,311
One, two.

488
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,899
Twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

489
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,317
Doctor, it's ready.

490
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,986
-Charge to 150 joules.
-Okay.

491
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,405
One, two, three, shock.

492
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,867
200 joules.

493
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,245
One, two, three, shock.

494
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,113
Sir.

495
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,366
Sir!

496
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,369
Sir, can you hear me?

497
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,111
Yeon-jun.

498
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,739
Yeon-jun!

499
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,116
Mom! It's Yeon-jun!

500
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:20,996
Are you okay?

501
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,958
It's Mom. Do you recognize me?

502
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,837
My goodness.
I thought you were going to die.

503
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,467
Yeon-jun, you're in the hospital now.

504
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,470
You woke up for the first time in a week.

505
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,431
Do you know how worried we've been?

506
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,687
Who are you?

507
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,606
What's wrong, Yeon-jun?

508
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,484
Don't you know who we are?

509
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,778
Yeon-jun?

510
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,822
Yes, Koo Yeon-jun.

511
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,076
You do remember your name, don't you?

512
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,165
Is it really you, Yeon-jun?

513
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,380
I missed you.

514
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,600
Yeon-jun. Oh dear…

515
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:33,777
PATIENT NAME: KOO YEON-JUN

516
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,243
What's wrong, Yeon-jun?

517
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,703
Yeon-jun, don't get up.

518
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,414
-Quick, go get the doctor.
-Okay.

519
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,505
What…

520
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,674
what year is it now?

521
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,094
It's 2007, of course.

522
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,929
2007?

523
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:09,313
I was definitely in 2002.

524
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,316
What's wrong, Yeon-jun?

525
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,194
Yeon-jun.

526
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,407
In my dream, I was Han Jun-hee,
not Kwon Min-ju.

527
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,243
And you. You weren't Nam Si-heon,
but Koo Yeon-jun.

528
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,332
No.

529
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,586
It can't be.

530
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,091
This can't be…

531
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,260
This can't be real.

532
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:47,184
This year, 2007, marks the tenth year
since the IMF crisis in Korea.

533
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,688
Meeting this year's target of 4%
in the economic growth rate will mean

534
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:55,192
that Korea will enter the era
of one trillion dollars in GDP.

535
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,569
This would put us
in the top ten in the world.

536
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,489
But despite becoming
an economically developed country,

537
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:04,076
businesses still face challenges
they must overcome.

538
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,579
Based on the doctor's diagnosis,

539
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,624
thankfully, there's nothing wrong
with your brain.

540
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,585
He said that your memory loss

541
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,047
is due to the shock of the accident.

542
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,268
I would like to know more…

543
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,313
about the accident.

544
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,315
You…

545
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,612
got into a car accident
while going on a trip with your friend.

546
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,032
A friend?

547
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,659
Yes.

548
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,662
Tae-ha was driving the car.

549
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,166
Do you remember?

550
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,545
No.

551
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,382
I was definitely on the bus by myself.

552
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,593
I can't remember at all…

553
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,431
who Tae-ha is…

554
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,728
or why I was in that car.

555
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:17,232
Where's this friend called Tae-ha now?

556
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:23,113
Before they could even try anything,

557
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,825
he died at the scene.

558
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:37,127
If you can't remember,
you don't have to force yourself to do so.

559
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,963
What's important is

560
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,674
that you're Koo Yeon-jun,
my one and only little brother.

561
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,802
That's all you need to know.

562
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,889
In the process of repeated layoffs
and increasing contracted workers…

563
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:49,848
Koo Yeon-jun.

564
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,935
…people relying on salaries…

565
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,186
Koo Yeon-jun.

566
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:57,981
…weaken them, resulting in polarization.

567
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,858
Since 2003,

568
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:03,195
the gap in salary between the top 20
and the bottom 20% has risen

569
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,780
for four consecutive years.

570
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:09,326
And in 2006, the highest gap was recorded,
where the difference was 6.95 times more.

571
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,454
Due to this, there are calls
for shifting the focus to welfare

572
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,541
and the distribution of wealth,
but some are still arguing

573
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,710
that we need the drivers of growth
to develop further

574
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,671
until Korea is firmly established as…

575
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,922
Jung In-gyu!

576
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,011
What's wrong with Min-ju?

577
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,684
I'm asking you why Min-ju is like this.

578
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,272
Hey, Jung In-gyu.

579
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,276
Say something. Why is she like this?

580
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,283
I killed Min-ju.

581
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,159
What are you talking about?

582
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,835
Nam Si-heon.

583
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,171
I killed her.

584
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,842
Yeon-jun, what's wrong?

585
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,218
Did you have a nightmare?

586
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,352
We're home. Let's get out.

587
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,750
Let's go in.

588
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,388
Here you go.

589
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,892
All right. Eat up.

590
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,023
Hospital food wasn't great, was it?
You probably haven't eaten properly.

591
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,036
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

592
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,956
What would you like to eat?
Shall I cook something else?

593
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,249
No, it's okay.

594
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,464
Why don't you try some ribs?
You love them, right?

595
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,840
Here, have this and--

596
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,426
Mom, let him take his time.

597
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:56,159
NOKSAN BUS TERMINAL

598
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,178
WE WILL CLOSE DOWN THIS SATURDAY
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT

599
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,108
Get closer, you three.

600
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,695
All right. On the count of three.

601
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,947
Three, two, one.

602
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,292
Sir.

603
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,087
You're…

604
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,553
You're Si-heon, right?

605
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,181
How have you been?

606
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,099
But

607
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,310
what are you doing here?

608
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,699
So, what you're saying is
that you're actually Si-heon,

609
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,036
but you're inside Koo Yeon-jun's body now?

610
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,248
Yes.

611
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,125
Min-ju's--

612
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,422
I mean, the dead boyfriend
Jun-hee talked about.

613
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,385
You must be thinking
I'm the crazy one this time, right?

614
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,596
Han Jun-hee

615
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,933
woke up in Kwon Min-ju's body.

616
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:44,893
And Nam Si-heon

617
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,230
woke up in Koo Yeon-jun's body.

618
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:55,278
It means that everything
Min-ju said back then was true.

619
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,239
Yes.

620
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,080
How have you been since then?

621
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,085
After we lost Min-ju,

622
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,047
the whole family was devastated
for quite a while.

623
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,966
My sister just cried all day, every day.

624
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:20,220
For a while,
I couldn't take care of the shop either.

625
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,391
On top of that, the world has changed.

626
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:30,021
Nobody listens to tapes or CDs anymore.

627
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,525
So,

628
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,947
I decided to close the record shop
and open a café in Seoul.

629
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,116
-A café?
-Yes.

630
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,743
Actually, it's because of Min-ju--

631
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,539
I mean, it's all because of Han Jun-hee.

632
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:53,879
Back then, Min-ju told me
that I'd become a café owner.

633
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,174
If I want to survive
in this competitive industry,

634
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,135
I should learn
how to be a barista in advance.

635
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,519
The image of Min-ju sitting
over there studying…

636
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,315
is still so vivid to me.

637
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,821
If only I had paid a bit more attention
to the things Han Jun-hee said

638
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,574
about what would happen in the future…

639
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,287
I could've prevented
such a terrible thing.

640
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,209
Sir.

641
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,961
It wasn't your fault.

642
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,464
Back then, none of us…

643
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,635
were able to believe her.

644
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,053
You're right.

645
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,558
There's no point in regretting it now.

646
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,315
By any chance,

647
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,194
have you heard anything about me

648
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,738
since I was in that car accident in 2002?

649
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,787
I heard you were in the hospital
after being in a serious accident.

650
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,331
But I haven't heard anything since then.

651
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,551
What about In-gyu?

652
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,512
What happened to In-gyu?

653
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,472
Oh, In-gyu.

654
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,625
Hey, Kwon Min-ju. Watch it!

655
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,919
-Sorry, it was a mistake.
-You did it on purpose.

656
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,963
-It was a mistake!
-She said it was a mistake.

657
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,965
A mistake? I was right next to her.

658
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,466
It was definitely on purpose.

659
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,677
Nam Si-heon,
if I was going to do it on purpose,

660
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,803
I'd do it like this.

661
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,723
-Like this!
-Kwon Min-ju!

662
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,392
-In-gyu!
-Get out of my way.

663
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,060
-Hey.
-You just made a big mistake.

664
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,354
-Let her off.
-I didn't do it on purpose!

665
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,274
-Hey, Kwon Min-ju!
-Get her.

666
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,777
Kwon Min-ju,
you're dead meat if I catch you.

667
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,404
Hey, Nam Si-heon. Get her quickly.

668
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,447
FIND A PERSON: KWON MIN

669
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,407
