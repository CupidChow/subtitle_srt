1
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:07,757
Hey!

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,552
Wait!

3
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,014
Hey! Wait!

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,892
Wait for me!

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,022
I'm really going to be late now.

6
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,774
Huh? Nam Si-heon!

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,902
Good thing you're here. Give me a ride.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,573
Not for free.

9
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,284
Oh, is that so?
Can I pay you with a punch?

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,163
Get on.

11
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,373
You always try to hit me.

12
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,048
Where's In-gyu?

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,550
He went in early
for the contest prep class.

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,434
What are you waiting for? Get going.

15
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,271
Okay, here we go.

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,280
Nam Si-heon, go faster.

17
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,658
A TIME CALLED YOU

18
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,827
-Yes.
-Okay, that's all for today.

19
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,121
Attention! Bow!

20
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,330
Thank you.

21
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,500
Thank you, sir.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,044
Jung In-gyu, let's go play basketball.

23
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,047
Mr. Jung, it's time
for my tutoring session.

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, that's right.

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,134
Really?

26
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,594
It's okay. I'll wait until you're done.

27
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,269
But since you're teaching me,
shouldn't I be paying you for the lesson?

28
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,312
-Don't worry about it.
-Hey, just take it.

29
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,024
You focus and learn better
when you pay for the lesson.

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,529
If paying you makes you feel uneasy,

31
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,532
I'll treat you to something nice
once my grades go up.

32
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,952
Shouldn't I be treating you
if your grades go up?

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,413
Teachers normally treat the students.

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,585
You're a true teacher
who is a paragon for all.

35
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,921
What are you doing?

36
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,090
Let's go.

37
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,633
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

38
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,973
In-gyu, do you like pizza?

39
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,725
-Yeah.
-Pizza?

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,062
-Then, I can treat you to pizza.
-Sounds good.

41
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,107
Hey, my scooter keys.
I'll be back in a moment.

42
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,363
-Let's go.
-Okay.

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,575
Hey, I'm sorry.

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,588
Sorry. It's just such a nice drawing.

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,748
So you have to work out
the number of intersections

46
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,210
between the graph, cos of 2x,
and the line, y equals 2x over pi.

47
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,295
I think I know how to solve this.

48
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:19,259
First, if you draw the graph like this,
there are three real roots.

49
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,426
Hey, that's right.

50
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,097
You're a really good teacher.
It's so much easier to understand.

51
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,772
What's up? You leaving?

52
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,567
Yeah, looks like you guys will take ages,
so I'm going to head out first.

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,361
-Let's play basketball next time.
-Yeah.

54
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,698
Hey, don't doze off, and pay attention.
His time is precious.

55
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,907
I'm off.

56
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,996
The next question
uses trigonometric functions.

57
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,581
First, you need
to memorize a few formulas.

58
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,586
Firstly, this one and this one…

59
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,607
I think I can solve it.

60
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,643
Are you ready for tomorrow's quiz?

61
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,104
Kind of.

62
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,127
-Have you been taking care of it?
-Yeah.

63
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,879
Have you given it a name too?

64
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,508
-No.
-Why not?

65
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,346
Because I think I'll really get attached
if I give it a name too.

66
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,612
Min-ju.

67
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,241
-Come here.
-What's up?

68
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,958
-It's a cat.
-Isn't it cute?

69
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,418
Yes, it is.

70
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,755
You wanna go say hello?

71
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,507
I'm a bit scared of cats.

72
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,351
Before we started studying,
I was totally petrified.

73
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,645
But I feel more confident
now that I've tried it.

74
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,440
I can also kind of remember
what I learned before.

75
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,568
Didn't I get more questions right
than you expected?

76
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,321
Jung In-gyu.

77
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,496
What's wrong?
Did something bad happen to you today?

78
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,625
No, it's nothing like that.
It's just that…

79
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,213
-I'm just a bit confused.
-About what?

80
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,631
Because I keep feeling

81
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,760
that you're different
from how you used to be.

82
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,223
I keep wondering
if it's because of your accident.

83
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,273
I mean, it's not that I don't like you
right now or anything.

84
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,235
Actually, it's great that you've become
more lively and outgoing.

85
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,989
It's just that I haven't gotten used
to the new you yet.

86
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,244
To be honest,
I know what you're trying to say.

87
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,954
You do?

88
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,832
Please wait just a little longer.

89
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,754
The Kwon Min-ju you used to know

90
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,757
will be back soon.

91
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,927
What do you mean?

92
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,475
You'll know what I mean
when the time comes.

93
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,189
So, trust me,

94
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,985
and please wait just a little longer.

95
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,404
Okay?

96
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,809
What's going on? Why is it so empty?

97
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,146
These days, Mom goes out
to meet the lawyer during the day

98
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,439
and goes to work at night.

99
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:26,941
What?

100
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,526
Lawyer?

101
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,695
You know, the divorce lawyer or whatever.

102
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,950
So what? Jjajangmyeon again?

103
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,079
Let's go out, Kwon Do-hun.

104
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,547
-Is it that good?
-It's so good.

105
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,631
Enjoy.

106
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,688
Kwon Do-hun.
Why did you run away that time? Huh?

107
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,858
I heard you ran away
after taking all the money from the house.

108
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,775
Why did you do it?

109
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,153
Come on. Let's not talk about the past.

110
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,822
Hey, answer nicely
when I ask you something, punk!

111
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,282
What's with the attitude?

112
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,043
To be honest, I heard everything that day.

113
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,671
-Heard what?
-The day Mom and Dad mentioned divorce.

114
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,215
I heard them arguing over
who would take me,

115
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,092
and I heard you getting angry at them.

116
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,932
I'm also still a minor,
and I can still get hurt too.

117
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,436
Why do I always
have to play second fiddle?

118
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,564
How could you two do this to me?

119
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,236
-Hey, Min…
-Min-ju.

120
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,330
Are you saying you ran away

121
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,166
'cause you thought
your parents wouldn't abandon your sister,

122
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,417
I mean me,

123
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,128
if you weren't there?

124
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,923
That was the only way.

125
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,014
I didn't really do it for you or anything.

126
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:27,103
I just did it because I was annoyed
that Mom and Dad treated us differently.

127
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,273
That is unexpected from you.

128
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,402
I never knew
you cared so much about your sister.

129
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,113
Hey, I told you I didn't do it for you.

130
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,157
Okay, so it was because you were annoyed?

131
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
Yes, exactly.

132
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,536
-How sweet.
-Hey!

133
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,163
Have a drumstick.

134
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:02,012
Sixty squared plus 60 squared,
then multiply by negative…

135
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,642
Thirty? Why can't I get the answer?

136
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,607
Hey, Nam Si-heon, come here for a sec.

137
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,239
What's up?

138
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,949
I can't solve this.

139
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,162
You used the wrong formula here.

140
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,375
You have to solve it with cosine,
so this formula should be used.

141
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,253
So it should be cosine instead of sine.

142
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,549
If you change sine to cosine,
then you get one over two.

143
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,801
I still can't get the answer.

144
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,013
This part is wrong.

145
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,183
The distance between A and C
is 50 meters, not 60.

146
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,019
-Look at this.
-Okay.

147
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,604
If you put 50 in,

148
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,983
you get 50 squared plus 60 squared,

149
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,820
and you divide by negative two
times three…

150
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,792
So, it's the second option?

151
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,461
-Yeah. You got it, right?
-Yes, thanks.

152
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,474
Damn it. This is exactly why I said
I didn't want Nam Si-heon to teach me.

153
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,895
I can't focus on the question.

154
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,073
When are you going to finish?

155
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,660
Come on. Let's go out and play basketball.

156
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,953
I'm busy right now.

157
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,455
You can do that later.
Let's just play for ten minutes.

158
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,581
I can't.

159
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,959
I'm writing some questions
for Min-ju to try later.

160
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,585
Let's play tomorrow.

161
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,003
Okay.

162
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,924
Nam Si-heon.

163
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,471
What's this?

164
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,558
I don't know.
Someone just asked me to give it to you.

165
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,600
Who?

166
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,935
The pretty girl in our class.

167
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,895
The pretty girl?

168
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,783
-Hey, Jung In-gyu.
-Yeah?

169
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,871
Min-ju wants to see me.
Come on. She must have something to say.

170
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,250
She must have something to say to you
if she only asked you to come.

171
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,377
-You go talk to her.
-Do you think so?

172
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,590
Just go already.

173
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:44,842
Okay, got it.

174
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,353
She could've just spoken to me.
What's with the note?

175
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,730
What could it be about?

176
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,027
Is she going to tell me…

177
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,447
she likes me again?

178
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,870
No way. What am I thinking?

179
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,080
If she tells you she likes you,

180
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,042
turn her down right away
for Jung In-gyu's sake.

181
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,715
Nam Si-heon.

182
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,022
What are you doing here?

183
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,318
Weren't you the one
who sent Si-heon that note?

184
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,821
Note? If I had something to say
to Nam Si-heon, I'd just say it.

185
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
Why would I send him a note?

186
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,617
I was sure it was you who sent it.

187
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,828
Who's that, then?

188
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,291
You are…

189
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,046
What? Are you surprised to see me?

190
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,220
Si-heon, I like you.

191
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,890
Oh, it's Byeon Da-hyeon.

192
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
Byeon Da-hyeon has a crush on Nam Si-heon?

193
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,354
I've liked you for quite a while.

194
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,318
If you're interested in me, too,
would you like to go out with me?

195
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,153
What?

196
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,658
What's wrong? You don't like me?

197
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,619
I always thought
we were in the same league.

198
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,749
-"League"?
-I'm sure the other kids think so too.

199
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,339
No, thanks.

200
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,427
-What?
-I don't want to go out with you.

201
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,096
Why not?

202
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,058
I'm waiting for the one destined for me.

203
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,561
"Destined"?

204
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,646
Yeah. Destined.

205
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,358
I'll only be with one person
for my entire life.

206
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,694
And I'm certain it's not you.

207
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,739
Why?

208
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,991
Why couldn't it be me?

209
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,411
If you were the one meant for me,

210
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,291
I don't think you'd talk about
people being in different "leagues."

211
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,845
In-gyu.

212
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,567
Now that I look at it,
it's not even Kwon Min-ju's handwriting.

213
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,805
You know Hong Ji-yeon, right?

214
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,058
Yes, the most popular girl in our major.

215
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,184
Yeah, her.

216
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,394
Yesterday, she told Koo Yeon-jun

217
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,689
that she likes him.

218
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,777
Told him that she likes him?

219
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,862
More importantly, guess what he said.

220
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,948
What?

221
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,701
"I'm waiting for the one destined for me."

222
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,288
"But, Ji-yeon, I'm certain it's not you."

223
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,750
-He was certain…
-Hey, keep it down.

224
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,336
He really rejected her for such a reason?

225
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,797
Don't you think
it's rare to see a guy like him?

226
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,385
As soon as he said, "It's not you,"
Hong Ji-yeon's face turned all red,

227
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,554
and she ran madly around the campus.

228
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,974
Wow, that's hilarious.

229
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,021
Whenever I'm about to forget it,
he does things exactly like Yeon-jun

230
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,648
and makes me all confused.

231
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,707
-Hi.
-Oh, hey.

232
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,592
Math.

233
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,785
These were in your desk drawer?

234
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,786
Yeah.

235
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,832
And no one saw who did it?

236
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,210
No one. I asked the others,
but they saw nothing.

237
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:16,006
Your attacker must've taken these photos
and put them in your drawer, right?

238
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,260
Most likely.
Who else would do something like this?

239
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,640
In the end, my hunch was right.

240
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,975
Remember what I said the other day?

241
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,102
My attacker would do something

242
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,439
if they found out I'd changed,
as they'd be worried I'd say something.

243
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,027
Min-ju, I think you've forgotten
about something more important here.

244
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,862
What?

245
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,449
Hey, the attacker taking these pictures
and sending them to you could be a way

246
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,411
for them to tell you they're watching
your every move and can get to you.

247
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,913
It could be a threat like that.

248
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,625
Well, I guess you could be right.

249
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,169
Still, he's made a move,
so we have some clues now.

250
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,547
The first clue. My attacker
is definitely a student at our school.

251
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,467
That's how they knew my class and my seat

252
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,053
and secretly put the pictures
in my desk drawer.

253
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,930
And second, look at these pictures.

254
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:09,101
These are all pictures of me
on my way home after school.

255
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,645
That means there was always a boy

256
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,482
in school uniform
with a camera on my way home.

257
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,152
If you did that in a town like Noksan,
you'd stand out, right?

258
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,739
So, you're saying

259
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,617
that we might find someone
who saw the attacker

260
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,911
if we ask around on your way home?

261
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,997
Yes. Exactly.

262
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,331
So, starting tomorrow,

263
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,001
let's ask around
if anyone has seen a boy taking photos.

264
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,211
Okay.

265
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,589
But we have the art competition tomorrow.

266
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,508
I don't know if we'll have time afterward.

267
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,592
Art competition?

268
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,932
Does that count toward our grades too?

269
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,481
-Are you good at drawing?
-Me?

270
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,586
-When will you color it?
-I'll just draw with a pencil.

271
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,930
Damn it.

272
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,891
Darn it.

273
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,570
Hey, Kwon Min--

274
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,532
-Wow, that looks really good.
-Not at all.

275
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,034
How about yours?

276
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,704
-Ta-da, look at mine.
-It's really good.

277
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,039
-Not bad, right?
-Not bad.

278
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,922
-Should we add some color?
-Yes.

279
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,982
Hey, where's Nam Si-heon?

280
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,445
You're right.
I haven't seen him in a while.

281
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,907
Maybe he's taking a nap on the bus.

282
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,534
Surely not.

283
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,077
No, I wouldn't put it past him.

284
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,330
Or he could be slacking off
and fooling around somewhere.

285
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,000
This is why you can't take
your eyes off him, even for a moment.

286
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,878
Just where is he?

287
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,800
Whatever.

288
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,928
I don't care.

289
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,859
Come on, Kwon Min-ju!

290
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,652
Let's go!

291
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,074
I asked you to forget what I said.
Why are you so mad?

292
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:16,329
Oh, you sort of had feelings
for me, too, didn't you?

293
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,000
Stop thinking about her.

294
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,753
You shouldn't

295
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,506
think about her.

296
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,185
Hey!

297
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,858
I knew you'd be slacking off.
You haven't even started drawing, right?

298
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,194
I only need ten minutes, you know.

299
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,072
It's not my problem
if you don't have any drawings to turn in.

300
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,247
Been lying in the grass, haven't you?

301
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,875
You've got a bunch of grass in your hair.

302
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,295
Not there. On this side.

303
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,131
Come here. I'll get it off for you.

304
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,594
Why are you going around
with grass in your hair?

305
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,013
Look at you.

306
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,331
Oh no! My drawing is going to get soaked.

307
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,170
Hey, hurry! Come on!

308
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,159
To be honest,
I'm not that good at drawing.

309
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,871
But today, even I was impressed
by how well it turned out.

310
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,667
Perhaps I'm an artistic genius
or something?

311
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,752
I think I might even get first place.

312
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,383
What is it?

313
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,594
What's up with you two today?

314
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,512
Huh?

315
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,098
Are you tired?

316
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,059
Yeah, I guess so.

317
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,105
-I sure see you two a lot lately.
-Hello.

318
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,108
Uncle, why are you harassing my guests?

319
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,193
Oh, you're standing up for your friends?

320
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:20,490
But are you guys really just her friends?

321
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,370
Isn't one of you going out
with Min-ju now?

322
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,164
Uncle, stop talking nonsense.

323
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,793
They just walked me home
because it was late.

324
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,421
I don't think so.

325
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,548
There's definitely something going on.

326
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,593
We just walked her home. That's all.

327
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,595
We'll get going, then.

328
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,639
Bye.

329
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,149
Okay, bye.

330
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,117
What now?

331
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,345
In-gyu.

332
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,307
Remember what you told me?

333
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,519
About how I seemed to be
a bit too interested in Kwon Min-ju.

334
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,480
You're right.

335
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,149
I'm very interested in her.

336
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,652
I like Kwon Min-ju.

337
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,324
So?

338
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,577
What are you going to do now?

339
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,621
If you tell Min-ju you like her

340
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,332
and she accepts your feelings,
are you two going out, then?

341
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,379
No.

342
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,549
I'm not going to tell Min-ju.

343
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,051
What are you talking about?

344
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,639
Aren't you telling me
because you're going to date her?

345
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,267
It's not like that.

346
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,111
I'm just telling you
because I don't want to lie to you.

347
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,573
Why aren't you going to tell Min-ju?

348
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,371
Because I like her?

349
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,626
You feel bad for me,
so you aren't going to tell Min-ju?

350
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,420
Even if it weren't for you,

351
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,676
I'm in a situation right now
where there's nothing I can do for her.

352
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,097
Once winter break starts
at the end of this year,

353
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,643
I'm moving to the States with my family.

354
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,157
When was that decided?

355
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,744
I found out only recently.

356
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,292
That's why telling Min-ju that I like her

357
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,297
would be meaningless
and just make things awkward.

358
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,174
I'll be leaving soon anyway.

359
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,676
If that's the reason…

360
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:34,017
you should have kept being cold to her
instead of giving her false hope.

361
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,520
If you leave like this, what about Min-ju?

362
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,066
Min-ju has already told me

363
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,903
she no longer likes me.

364
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,197
Really?

365
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
Are you sure she didn't just lie…

366
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,165
to keep being friends with you?

367
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,219
I'm home.

368
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,347
-What about dinner?
-I ate.

369
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,098
Si-heon, wait.

370
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,894
We really must pick the school
you'll be attending.

371
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,773
I've narrowed it down to a few places.
You can decide.

372
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,780
Do I have to go to the States?

373
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,198
What?

374
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:35,244
Can't I just go to school here by myself?

375
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,581
What do you mean?
We've already decided to go together.

376
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,750
What's wrong?

377
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,296
Nothing. I'll take a look.

378
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:54,741
Utilitarianism. The greatest good
for the greatest number of people, okay?

379
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,743
Who was its leading proponent?

380
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,538
No one has an answer for me, right? Okay.

381
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,123
Hey, Nam Si-heon!

382
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,376
Hey, Mr. Nam Si-heon.

383
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,880
Yes?

384
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,757
Where is your mind, you little punk?

385
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,470
Hey, this isn't the time to be complacent
just because of your good grades, okay?

386
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,305
With next year's CSAT in mind,

387
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,266
you need to study hard
as if you were already in the final year.

388
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,351
Yes, sir.

389
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,978
You little brat.

390
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,108
Okay, that's it for today.
Hey, homeroom rep.

391
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,195
Attention! Bow!

392
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,654
Thank you.

393
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,655
Bye.

394
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,830
Get changed into gym clothes
and go to the yard for PE class.

395
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,666
Got it? Come on, get up.

396
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,252
Boys, go change outside.

397
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,531
The camera.

398
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,699
Hey, are you really going to do it?

399
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,785
Just hurry and give it to me.

400
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,434
Let's go to the canteen.

401
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,236
Nam Si-heon.

402
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,447
Let's go find out about the pictures
after In-gyu finishes tutoring me.

403
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,533
Go with Jung In-gyu. I'm not going.

404
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,828
Why not?
You agreed to come with us the other day.

405
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,913
I have other plans.

406
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,211
You had a fight with In-gyu, right?

407
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,173
The two of you have been weird today.

408
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,093
What did you fight about?

409
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,140
I can't tell you even if you ask,
so don't ask.

410
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,997
In-gyu, can I ask you something?

411
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,793
What did you and Nam Si-heon fight about?

412
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,507
Min-ju.

413
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,761
You still like Si-heon, don't you?

414
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,957
Well,

415
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,920
I would say Si-heon and I
are just good friends.

416
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,967
What if Si-heon told you he liked you?

417
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,594
Would you still be just friends?

418
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,305
-In-gyu, that--
-Hey, Jung In-gyu.

419
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,727
What are you doing?

420
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,773
What? Did I say
something I shouldn't have?

421
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,276
Min-ju, Si-heon--

422
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,193
Hey!

423
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,279
Stop right there.

424
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,032
Weren't you listening yesterday?
I explained everything!

425
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,492
Sure.

426
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,996
You're moving abroad,
so you can't do anything. About that too!

427
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,873
Shouldn't Min-ju also know
that you're leaving?

428
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,850
What?

429
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,021
You already knew
that he's going to the States?

430
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,817
Yeah.

431
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,612
Since when?

432
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,614
When did you find out?

433
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,825
Just recently.

434
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,588
In-gyu.

435
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,174
Let's look into the photos another time.

436
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,486
It looks like today's lesson
is over, right?

437
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,323
Min-ju.

438
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,367
Later.

439
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,619
Let's talk some other time.

440
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,309
What if Si-heon told you he liked you?

441
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,269
Would you still be just friends?

442
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,467
NOKSAN PARK

443
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,880
Wait.

444
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,727
What are you doing here all alone?

445
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,485
About what Jung In-gyu said earlier,

446
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,279
don't let it bother you.

447
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,201
I'll just get myself sorted on my own.

448
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,666
You should've said it sooner.

449
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,835
Huh?

450
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,587
About you going to America.

451
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,090
Why did you cause this mess
by not telling In-gyu?

452
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,926
Come to think of it, you're the problem.

453
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,471
I mean, I had my reasons--

454
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,641
Well, you made me your accomplice,
and now he's mad at me too.

455
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,729
Wait, that's what's bothering you
the most right now?

456
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,690
Yeah, of course it is.
What else would it be?

457
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,984
Fine.

458
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,695
I'm sorry I dragged you into it, okay?

459
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,365
That's right.
You should be sorry. Be sorry!

460
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,742
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry for everything, okay?

461
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,662
For not telling In-gyu,
for making you my accomplice,

462
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,913
and for liking you too!

463
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,830
Yeah.

464
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,056
Anyway,

465
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,767
it's my fault…

466
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,354
so I'll take care of it.

467
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,772
Bye.

468
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:12,798
No.

469
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,180
That was not

470
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,933
what I wanted to say.

471
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,021
What I wanted to tell you is…

472
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,319
I like you.

473
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,950
I like you a lot.

474
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,040
All this time, I pretended otherwise.

475
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,375
But

476
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,964
I can't pretend I don't like you anymore.

477
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,802
No matter how hard I try,
my feelings won't go away.

478
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,229
You're making a mistake right now.

479
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,732
I told you before.

480
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,902
You shouldn't tell your friend
that you like them.

481
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,030
You're going to regret this so much
tomorrow morning.

482
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,365
I won't regret it.

483
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,868
You were already…

484
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,790
more than just a friend to me.

485
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:39,648
