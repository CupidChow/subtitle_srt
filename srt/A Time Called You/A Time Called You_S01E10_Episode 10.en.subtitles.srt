1
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,051
Min-ju is at peace now.

2
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,389
What do you mean by that?

3
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,147
Nam Si-heon.

4
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,483
I killed her.

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,118
You're telling me In-gyu killed Min-ju?

6
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,829
In-gyu would never do something like that.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,624
And he also killed himself?

8
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,378
Something is completely off here.

9
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,339
Ever since what happened to In-gyu…

10
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,552
I've been trying to figure out…

11
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,014
where things went wrong.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,144
This

13
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,481
started on the day Min-ju died.

14
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,366
Shouldn't we change
what happened that night, then?

15
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,625
To be honest,

16
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,711
a part of me…

17
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,133
wanted to ignore
what had already happened…

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,931
and just continue living with you.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,351
But…

20
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,400
But you probably
couldn't bring yourself to do that.

21
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,240
I would've felt the same if I were you.

22
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,328
If you could only go back,
you would've done it over and over again.

23
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,955
Because Nam Si-heon

24
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,582
and Koo Yeon-jun

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,043
are that kind of people.

26
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,005
Even though you knew you would die,

27
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,510
you got on that plane
so you could see me again.

28
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,011
Now,

29
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,265
it's my turn to do something.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,028
I'll go back to 1998.

31
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,783
What should I do when I get there?

32
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,958
The day Min-ju dies.

33
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,462
We must get through it safe and sound.

34
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,840
When you wake up in Min-ju's body,

35
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:58,303
you have to do whatever it takes
for Min-ju to make it out alive…

36
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,099
on October 13, 1998.

37
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,895
Okay.

38
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,230
I'll do that.

39
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,484
I'll try.

40
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,349
A TIME CALLED YOU

41
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,737
I want to ask you something.

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
What is it?

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,544
"Whenever your heart calls me."

44
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,091
What does it mean?

45
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,322
"I will come to you."

46
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,287
Give me your hand.

47
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,457
When I get back from 1998…

48
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,627
you still have to stay by my side.

49
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,549
Promise me.

50
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:42,967
I promise.

51
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,552
When the lights outside the window

52
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,057
Start dimming one by one

53
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,229
I write a letter to the sky

54
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:41,609
You left me for someone else…

55
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,549
Jun-hee.

56
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,346
What's wrong? Are you okay?

57
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,724
Are you back from 1998?

58
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
No.

59
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,731
You weren't there when I woke up,
so I was surprised.

60
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,278
I thought everything that happened
last night was a dream.

61
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,039
Look at me. It's not a dream, is it?

62
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:40,918
Right.

63
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,548
From now on, you can never leave me, okay?

64
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,050
Okay.

65
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,927
You promised.

66
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,345
Sure, it's a promise.

67
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,640
I'll always be by your side.

68
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,953
Then last night,

69
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,415
you couldn't go back to the past
even though you listened to that song.

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,253
It was the first time you failed, right?
What could be the reason?

71
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,173
I've been doing some thinking.

72
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,425
If we compare

73
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,721
the situations
when Jun-hee and I traveled through time,

74
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,181
we might find a clue.

75
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,227
So what they have in common is

76
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,397
this cassette player and listening
to that song on this cassette.

77
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,525
Then, whether it be in the past or future,

78
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,027
you wake up in the body of someone
who resembles you.

79
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,616
You did that last night.
So, why couldn't you go back?

80
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,544
Perhaps there are other conditions
that we don't know about.

81
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,720
Also, there is something odd.

82
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,849
In 1998, the attacker
had already killed two people.

83
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,852
Byeon Da-hyeon and Min-ju.

84
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,148
If the attacker killed two people
just a few months apart,

85
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,318
it means they're a serial killer
who can't control themselves.

86
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,281
Why weren't there
any more killings after that?

87
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,198
You're right.

88
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,202
I also searched for more,
but I couldn't find anything.

89
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,956
Usually, serial killers only stop killing

90
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,710
when they're in prison, seriously injured,

91
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,378
or something like that.

92
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,923
Perhaps after killing Min-ju,

93
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,720
he was placed in a situation
where he couldn't commit murder again.

94
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,642
I'll go to the school and find out.

95
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,561
Something else must have happened

96
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,105
around that time.

97
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,483
I'll search for articles from 1998, then.

98
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:14,071
Maybe there were other incidents in Noksan
we didn't know about then.

99
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,309
Sir.

100
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,565
My goodness. Look who we have here.

101
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,572
You remember me?

102
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,992
Of course I do. You're Nam Si-heon.

103
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,537
Girls from other schools lined up
at the school gate to see you.

104
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,873
Hey, it's good to see you.

105
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,708
Come on. Come take a seat.

106
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,211
Here. Be careful.

107
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,672
Be careful.

108
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,761
I heard you were in an accident.

109
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,722
Is that when you hurt your leg?

110
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,725
It's a lot better now.

111
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,437
Have you been well, sir?

112
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,482
Of course. I'm old enough to retire soon.

113
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,570
Anyway, what brought you here today?

114
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,155
I have something to ask you.

115
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,201
Do you remember Kwon Min-ju,
a girl from our class?

116
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,536
Yes.

117
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,541
I was wondering if anything else happened
around the time of that incident.

118
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,337
That was back in 1998, wasn't it?

119
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,465
I'm not sure.

120
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,721
You know, perhaps someone was injured
or suddenly transferred schools.

121
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,139
Even something trivial.

122
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,476
I'm just curious
if there was anything you found strange.

123
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,938
Well, you probably already know
about Byeon Da-hyeon.

124
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,570
I don't remember
anything major happening since then.

125
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,159
By any chance,

126
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,121
are there still copies
of the school newsletter from back then?

127
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,914
There's something I want to check.

128
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,585
Well, I suppose
there should be copies in the library.

135
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,637
No.

136
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,557
Why are you curious
about what happened back then?

137
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,106
It's because you can't accept
that In-gyu did it, isn't it?

138
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,984
Yes.

139
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,706
Since he confessed,
there wasn't much I could do.

140
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,376
But I kept thinking it was strange.

141
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,295
Why would In-gyu do something like that?

142
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,217
I was actually thinking
about what you said.

143
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,469
Something strange did happen.

144
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,974
It wasn't a kid from our class
but from another class.

145
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,018
He took a leave of absence
due to health issues

146
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,603
and was admitted to the hospital.

147
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,439
I just assumed he was sick or something.

148
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,525
But I found out later

149
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,989
that he was admitted to a locked ward
at a psychiatric hospital.

150
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,077
When was that?

151
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,996
It was in 1998.

152
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,499
It wasn't long
after what happened to Min-ju.

153
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:41,130
The whole school was unsettled
by what happened to Min-ju and Da-hyeon,

154
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,757
glossing over what happened to him.

155
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,553
Do you remember who that kid was?

156
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,263
Yes, of course.

157
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,099
I was his homeroom teacher
in his first year.

158
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,393
Give me a moment.

159
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:55,853
His name was

160
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,397
Chu…

161
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,150
I believe it was Cheol, Chung,
or something like that.

162
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,659
Okay, where should I put it?

163
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,786
You can put it down there.

164
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,165
Jeez, I told you I'd go get it.

165
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,335
No need for such trouble.

166
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,128
I had some free time today.

167
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,464
Thanks. Do you want a cup of coffee?

168
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,090
-Sounds good.
-Have a seat.

169
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,229

179
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,988
along with bad dreams.

180
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,782
Doesn't reading this kind of thing
make it worse?

181
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,996
Chan-yeong.

182
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,416
Do you remember the dream
I told you about the other day?

183
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,333
Yeah.

184
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,759
It wasn't a dream.

185
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,094
What?

186
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,595
I…

187
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,436
met Yeon-jun again.

188
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,024
STUDENT RECORDS

189
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,487
-See you tomorrow.
-Good job today.

190
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,744
Oh, here it is. It's him.

191
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,203
This guy.

192
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,123
Oh Chan-hui.

193
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,349
You're telling me
you time-traveled back to 1998

194
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,521
and woke up in the body of the girl
who wrote this diary, Kwon Min-ju?

195
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:51,403
And everything that happened to you
since 1998 was actually real.

196
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,238
Right?

197
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,407
Yeah.

198
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,994
And you met Yeon-jun again.

199
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,373
But Yeon-jun is actually the same person
you met in 1998

200
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,126
called Nam Si-heon?

201
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,011
I'm not sure how all of this is possible.

202
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,597
Just how did you go back to 1998?

203
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,727
Using this.

204
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,482
I went back by listening
to Seo Ji-won's song with this.

205
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,568
I fell asleep listening to music on this.

206
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,279
And I was in 1998 when I woke up.

207
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,577
Kwon Min-ju and I had the same face,
as did Yeon-jun and Si-heon.

208
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,580
I think that's how it was possible.

209
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,547
As long as there is someone

210
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,050
who looks just like you
in the time you're trying to go to,

211
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,427
you can listen to this song,

212
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,888
travel through time,
and wake up in that person's body.

213
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,266
Is that what you're saying?

214
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,309
That's what we think.

215
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,523
I know it's hard to believe.

216
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,026
I thought it was a dream
in the beginning too.

217
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,944
No.

218
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,573
I believe you.

219
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,324
Really?

220
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,663
But why are you interested
in the Byeon Da-hyeon murder case?

221
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,378
Actually,

222
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:37,050
I think the culprit in that case
and whoever murdered Kwon Min-ju in 1998

223
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,219
might be the same person.

224
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,891
What?

225
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,310
Kwon Min-ju was murdered in 1998.

226
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,688
At the time, the culprit
confessed to killing Min-ju,

227
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,356
so he was immediately arrested.

228
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,942
But I have a feeling
the real culprit was someone else.

229
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,487
I'm sure the murderer of Byeon Da-hyeon

230
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,574
killed Kwon Min-Ju as well.

231
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,006
Chan-yeong.

232
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah?

233
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,097
Weren't you getting me some coffee?
I'd really love a cup.

234
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,142
Sure. Give me a minute.

235
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,478
Who is this?

236
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,188
Do you like her?

237
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,442
Chan-yeong, you can't be going through
my drawers like that.

238
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,070
Give it now.

239
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,280
You like her, don't you?

240
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,241
No, it's just…

241
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,496
that she doesn't have any friends
and doesn't talk much.

242
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,248
She's like me.

243
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,543
So I've just taken an interest in her.

244
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
That's liking someone.

245
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,009
If you like her that much,

246
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,386
you can just have her.

247
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,306
Have her? How?

248
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,016
If you make her into a specimen,

249
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,143
you can have her completely.

250
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,521
Like when you're collecting butterflies.

251
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,234
If you make her into a specimen
when she's at her most beautiful,

252
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,737
she'll be yours forever.

253
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,951
Chan-yeong, what are you talking about?

254
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,537
People are not insects.

255
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,042
If you like someone,
you must cherish them, not hurt them.

256
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,460
Cherish them?

257
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,211
Of course.

258
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,507
You must never hurt them
or do anything like that.

259
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,927
Huh? Where's the fun in that?

260
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,932
Anyway, this girl's eyes

261
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,686
look just like the eyes
of our puppy, Happy.

262
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,865
Is that how it was?

263
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,410
The person who killed Byeon Da-hyeon

264
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,705
also killed Kwon Min-ju?

265
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,386
YEON-JUN

266
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,681
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

267
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,318
The phone has been turned off.
You will be forwarded to voice mail.

268
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,319
After the tone…

269
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,490
From what I can remember,

270
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,619
Chan-hui was introverted and quiet.

271
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,296
SIBLINGS: OH CHAN-YEONG

272
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,381
Oh Chan-yeong.

273
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,508
Oh Chan-yeong?

274
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,136
Oh, I see he had a younger brother.

275
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,057
If he was born in 1988,
he must've been 11 in 1998.

276
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,070
Sir.

277
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,866
I think I know who the culprit is.

278
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,121
It's someone called Oh Chan-hui.
He went to Noksan High School in 1998.

279
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,665
Yes.

280
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,711
It also explains why the crimes stopped
after Min-ju's murder.

281
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,673
Apparently, he's been locked up
in a psychiatric facility since 1998.

282
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,136
No, I'm heading
to Jun-hee's home right now.

283
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,017
I will send you
Oh Chan-hui's school records first.

284
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,311
Okay.

285
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,494
Chan-yeong.

286
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,128
Chan-yeong.

287
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,008
Chan-yeong.

288
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,324
Oh, I'm sorry.

289
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,535
You said listening to this
took you to the past.

290
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,286
I was curious, so I had a listen.

291
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,373
Did you…

292
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,708
It's a great song.

293
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,419
But I just had a nice nap.

294
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:51,967
Yeah.

295
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,429
Jun-hee, I'm hungry.

296
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,014
Got anything to eat?

297
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,141
Yeah, I have fruit. Do you want some?

298
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,073
-But, Jun-hee.
-Yeah?

299
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,742
The murder of Kwon Min-ju in 1998.

300
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,912
Any clues on who the real culprit is?

301
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah. When Kwon Min-Ju was attacked
for the first time,

302
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,669
her attacker was wearing
a Noksan High School uniform.

303
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,424
The real culprit must be a male student
who attended Noksan High School back then.

304
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,134
I see.

305
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,219
I know I must have sounded crazy.

306
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,014
Thank you for taking me seriously.

307
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,225
No, I'm the one who should be grateful.

308
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,644
What are you grateful for?

309
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,274
Thanks to you, I just found out

310
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,486
what happened
to my brother and me back then.

311
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,454
Did I ever tell you?

312
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,123
I used to live in Noksan when I was young.

313
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,026
You shouldn't have disturbed me earlier.

314
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,592
Dear, I'm going to wait…

315
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,180
Hey.

316
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,516
Wake up.

317
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,143
Hey.

318
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,063
Hey, wake up.

319
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,237
Are you awake?

320
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,001
Oh, taxi!

321
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,795
Taxi!

322
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,415
OH CHAN-HUI

323
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,792
Are you okay?

324
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,711
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm absolutely fine.

325
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,132
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

326
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,217
Something terrible could've happened.

327
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,227
No.

328
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,314
Something terrible almost happened to you.
Are you okay?

329
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,237
What were you doing here?

330
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,200
If you're not hurt, I'll be on my way.

331
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,119
Thank you so much for that.

332
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,541
Where are you going alone at this hour?

333
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,799
I think it'd be dangerous
for you to go alone.

334
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,134
I'll come with you.

335
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,595
No, you don't have to.

336
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,806
I just saved--

337
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,312
I just saved you.
What if something happens to you now?

338
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
May I ask where you're headed?

339
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,323
My mom's shop at the big intersection.

340
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,285
I know a shortcut to the intersection.

341
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,745
Let's take it.

342
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,168
Okay.

343
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,160
What's wrong?

344
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,627
Stop. Let go of me!

345
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,546
Why are you doing this?

346
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,505
Somebody help--

347
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,429
Stop.

348
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,225
Get away from me.

349
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,810
Get away.

350
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,543
Chan-yeong.

351
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,800
Chan-yeong.

352
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,534
You don't know how disappointed I am
that you're not Kwon Min-ju.

353
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,799
Can I help you with your order?

354
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,678
What the hell?

355
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,595
What?

356
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,142
What could this be?

357
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,105
Who is this?

358
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,566
So, what would you like to order?

359
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:10,154
Female customers usually enjoy Set A or B.

360
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,531
As for guys…

361
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,742
At first, I was excited
because I thought you were Kwon Min-ju.

362
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,871
But the moment
I saw you looking right at me, I realized

363
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,001
that you were not the Kwon Min-ju I saw
in that photo back then.

364
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,296
You didn't shrink back or cower
like Min-ju used to.

365
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,385
I didn't feel an inkling of excitement
when I saw you.

366
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,435
Jun-hee.

367
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,736
Jun-hee.

368
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,657
Jun-hee!

369
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,745
Jun-hee!

370
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,840
Hello? Somebody's collapsed.

371
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,052
It's Apartment 805, 45 Yeoksam-dong.
Please hurry.

372
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,014
Jun-hee.

373
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,766
Jun-hee!

374
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,694
Koo Yeon-jun?

375
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,326
Oh Chan-yeong.

376
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,294
What are you doing here?

377
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,297
Was it you?

378
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,759
No.

379
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,553
She was like that when I got here.

380
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,846
Then why were you in there?

381
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,517
I thought whoever did this had come back.

382
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,143
I was hiding because I was scared.

383
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,521
Do you expect me to believe that?

384
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,275
Did you happen to know
what your brother had done?

385
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,362
Did you do this because Jun-hee found out?

386
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,782
What are you talking about? My brother?

387
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,661
I had something to give Jun-hee.
See? That chair.

388
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,830
I just dropped by to give her that chair.

389
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,999
Yeon-jun.

390
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,752
I'm the one
who should be scared out of my skin.

391
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,838
Do you know how shocked I was

392
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,842
when Jun-hee told me
you'd come back to life?

393
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,512
Didn't you say…

394
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,599
she was like this when you got here?

395
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,334
It was you.

396
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,719
It wasn't Oh Chan-hui.

397
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,598
You killed Kwon Min-ju and Byeon Da-hyeon.

398
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,349
Didn't you?

399
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,715
It was you.

400
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,218
It was you all along.

401
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,013
Why did you kill her?

402
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,891
Why did you kill Kwon Min-Ju?

403
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,726
Yeah.

404
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,190
Apparently, it was me.

405
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,777
But the funny thing is,

406
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,364
the things my older brother told me
when I was little…

407
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,618
Today, I finally figured out the answer
to that puzzle.

408
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,378
Finding a way
to get into my brother's body in 1998,

409
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,129
I guess that's just a bonus.

410
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:40,925
Yeon-jun.

411
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,846
All of this

412
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:50,142
is thanks to your girlfriend, Jun-hee.

413
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,021
Thank you.

414
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,617
No, Chan-hui.

415
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,788
You were wrong.

416
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,798
WHAT WOULD NAM SI-HEON SAY
IF HE FOUND OUT I LIKE HIM?

417
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,824
I'll lower myself to lie next to you

418
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:14,870
And I'll tell you
That because I cannot forget you

419
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,582
I'll just continue to love you

420
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:24,588
Dear, I'm going to wait…

421
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,659
She's damaged because of you.

422
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,623
It's fine.

423
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,421
I still have plenty of time.

424
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,406
Come on. Let's go, okay?

425
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,074
-Taking a shower?
-Stop it.

426
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,493
-Hey.
-Okay!

427
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,288
-Hey, get back here.
-I told you to get a move on.

428
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,748
Oh no.

429
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,418
Si-heon, open your eyes.

430
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,637
No, Si-heon. Oh no.

431
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,059
Oh, please.

432
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,151
Oh no.

433
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,445
What am I supposed to do now, Si-heon?

434
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,618
Si-heon. How did you end up here?

435
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,290
What am I going to do?

436
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,418
Si-heon.

437
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,255
Si-heon.

438
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,635
Si-heon.

439
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,596
Oh no.

440
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,709
Oh Chan-yeong.

441
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,756
We must find Oh Chan-yeong.

442
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,722
I'm going to find the cassette player
that he took…

443
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,147
and bring Si-heon back to life,
no matter what.

444
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,297
This is CCTV of Chan-yeong
caught after the crime.

445
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,177
Where is he now?

446
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,347
We went to his home and studio,
but he wasn't there.

447
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,893
We're using the CCTV footage
to trace his whereabouts.

448
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,606
But the items that he stole.
Do you know what they are?

449
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,651
My cassette player and my diary.

450
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,239
Those two things disappeared
after he left.

451
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:47,035
They wouldn't be particularly valuable.
Why would he have stolen them?

452
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,830
Do you have any idea why?

453
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,126
Or are those items somehow special?

454
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,594
Chan-yeong.

455
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,053
Chan-yeong.

456
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,819
By the time
I woke Oh Chan-yeong up last night,

457
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,114
he might have already gone back
to 1998 once.

458
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,038
But if he went back to 1998,

459
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,082
whose body would he have woken up in?

460
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,753
There has to be someone
who looks like him.

461
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,924
His older brother, Oh Chan-hui.

462
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,427
Si-heon sent me this last night.

463
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,636
No, she's not Kwon Min-ju.

464
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,557
Right, Han Jun-hee?

465
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,187
Chan-hui.

466
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,356
I'm back from school.

467
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,025
Well.

468
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,032
I heard the dog whimpering for ages.

469
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,911
I thought he was playing with Happy.

470
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,916
But even after killing the dog,

471
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,002
he didn't even bat an eye.

472
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,755
Honestly. Did I really give birth to him?

473
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,174
He makes my skin crawl,

474
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,802
and I'm also worried.

475
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,971
It's driving me nuts, Chan-hui.

476
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,936
Where's Chan-yeong?

477
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,525
Oh Chan-yeong.

478
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,094
Are you sleeping?

479
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,682
Okay.

480
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,686
I guess you're not in the mood to talk
right now, are you?

481
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,482
Then I'll leave you to yourself.

482
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,944
Mom's mad at me, isn't she?

483
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,617
Because of what I did to Happy.

484
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,078
Are you mad at me too?

485
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,666
No? Why would I be?

486
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,003
You also said that if we like something,
we shouldn't hurt it.

487
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,092
Sorry.

488
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,388
Back then, I didn't know much better.

489
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,266
Chan-yeong.

490
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,727
You were right.

491
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,896
If you really like something,

492
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,358
you have to make it into a specimen
and make it yours.

493
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,486
-Really?
-Of course.

494
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:55,617
Because our little Chan-yeong
is a special person, just like me.

495
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,036
Normal people like Mom

496
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,123
will never understand people
like you and me.

497
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,379
Shall I let you in on a secret?

498
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:09,881
I'm actually

499
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,718
you from the future.

500
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,640
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

501
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,228
Later, much later,

502
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,189
you'll get what I'm saying one day.

503
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,942
The most important thing
is to hide yourself

504
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,987
for that day.

505
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,947
Hide myself?

506
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,992
From now on,

507
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,122
you can't let anyone find out
just how special you are.

508
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,251
Be as nice and indifferent as possible.

509
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,881
Put on a mask that won't make others wary,
and show them it.

510
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,427
That'll make things easier for you.

511
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,221
Keep that in mind.

512
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,565
Next time I go to make specimens,

513
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,525
come with me.

514
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:15,030
I'm going to make
a very big and very pretty specimen.

515
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,873
SAEMMUL CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL

516
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,751
His condition improves on some days
and worsens on others.

517
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,421
On a good day,
we can have some light conversations.

518
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,841
But on a bad day, he spouts gibberish

519
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,760
and even has seizures.

520
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,178
Just a moment.

521
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,552
Hello, Mr. Oh Chan-hui.

522
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,764
My name is Han Jun-hee.

523
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,614
I am here
because I need to ask you something.

524
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,744
In 1998,

525
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,998
do you remember what happened back then?

526
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,879
In 1998,

527
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,923
a student from Noksan High School
named Kwon Min-ju died.

528
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,184
You remember, don't you?

529
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,816
If you heard me, please answer.
This is really important.

530
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,864
Please answer me!

531
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:25,452
Surely you know whether it was you
or your little brother who killed Min-ju?

532
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,794
I can…

533
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:37,923
hear everything.

534
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,805
Everything that is happening…

535
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,518
I can see and hear it all.

536
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,068
But that's all.

537
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,447
All I can do is watch.

538
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,326
I can't do anything.

539
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,953
Yeah? Yeah.

540
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,841
I promised you last time, didn't I?

541
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,178
That when I went to make
a bigger and prettier specimen,

542
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,805
I'd take you along.

543
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,448
What do you think? Do you like it?

544
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,452
Keep shining the light on her.

545
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,211
Be careful, or you might get hurt.

546
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,800
It'll be over soon if you listen to me.
Then we'll let you go, okay?

547
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,634
No.

548
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,220
No.

549
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,555
It…

550
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,516
It wasn't me.

551
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,561
I didn't do it!

552
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,775
I didn't want to do it.

553
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,155
If it wasn't you who did it,

554
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,158
then your younger brother did it, right?

555
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,411
It was Oh Chan-yeong's doing…

556
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,415
right?

557
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,641
Kwon Min-Ju.

558
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,229
How…

559
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,564
How are you…

560
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,255
I didn't do it.

561
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,214
Min-ju.

562
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,176
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

563
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,053
They made me do it.

564
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,722
They forced me to do it, Min-ju.

565
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,642
I never wanted anything like that, Min-ju.

566
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,019
-It wasn't me, Min-ju!
-All right, Mr. Oh Chan-hui.

567
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,689
-If there's someone precious to you…
-Mr. Oh. It's okay.

568
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,192
It's okay.

569
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:34,075
It was Oh Chan-yeong who killed Min-ju,
not Oh Chan-hui.

570
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,914
Oh Chan-hui went insane
watching what his brother did.

571
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,751
Who are the "they" he was talking about?

572
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,547
Other than Oh Chan-yeong,
who could've told him to do such a thing?

573
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:52,886
What is it?

574
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,098
Thanks to you, I just found out

575
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:01,186
what happened
to my brother and me back then.

576
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,148
The fact that the murders in 1998

577
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,402
were committed by Oh Chan-yeong,
not Oh Chan-hui.

578
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:15,408
Oh Chan-yeong only realized that
after what I said yesterday.

579
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,286
What have I done?

580
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,247
I was the one who told him everything.

581
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,835
So both Si-heon and Min-ju are dead
because I…

582
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,509
Min-ju and Si-heon died

583
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,802
because of Oh Chan-yeong, not you.

584
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,722
It's all Oh Chan-yeong's doing.

585
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:39,974
We have to catch him.

586
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,102
We have to catch him
and find the cassette player.

587
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,188
That's how we can bring back Si-heon.

588
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,220
Hello?

589
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,225
What?

590
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,233
You said you've caught Oh Chan-yeong?

591
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,150
Yes.

592
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,820
We arrested him, hiding in a motel.

593
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,699
What was he doing
at the time of his arrest?

594
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,617
Was he listening to music?

595
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,869
How did you know that?

596
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,084
Where is that cassette player right now?

597
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,253
Could we get it back right away?

598
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,172
Returning it to you won't be an issue

599
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,551
once the National Forensic Service
is done collecting evidence.

600
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,929
However, the cassette player
isn't intact right now.

601
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,780
Oh Chan-yeong.

602
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:22,869
Oh Chan-yeong!

603
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,264
Come on! Grab him quickly!

604
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,657
No, it's not time yet.

605
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,577
Why did it have to be now? Why?

606
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,672
EVIDENCE NUMBER 23-01

607
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,649
-Hey! It was you!
-Oh, hang on.

608
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,651
It was you from the very beginning, huh?

609
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,195
You were the killer! Bring Si-heon back!

610
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,530
You can't be doing this.

611
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,489
Bring Si-heon back!

612
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:46,077
Why did you do it?

613
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,454
No, Han Jun-hee!

614
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:54,377
You've got things in the wrong order.
First, you need to ask yourself.

615
01:01:55,503 --> 01:02:00,883
"What did I, Han Jun-hee,
possibly do to Kwon Min-Ju"?

616
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,885
Hey, let's go.

617
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,805
You don't understand?

618
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,601
I wasn't the one who killed Kwon Min-ju.

619
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,355
It was you, Han Jun-hee.

620
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:21,125
