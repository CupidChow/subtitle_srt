Episode 15

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I never thought that

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Minister Jiang would dare to

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
rebel under His Majesty's nose.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Although His Majesty punished him to prison,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
he never committed a death sentence.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Isn't it easy to kill someone in prison?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Not everyone is like our

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Governor Zhou, who can turn the tide.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Right?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I didn't ask when I was in trouble.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now I'm here to ask for help.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Governor Zhou, it's a misunderstanding.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a misunderstanding.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A man should be able to

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
do what he can.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please take care of me in the future.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sure.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Since you're here,

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
how about having a drink with me?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sure.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Go and call Jiang Yue here.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's drink.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Minister Jiang, you're drunk.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I didn't expect you

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
to let your daughter stay in the mansion.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're so kind.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, I'm kind.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Madam, come out.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've invited a guest today.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'd like to invite you to the clinic.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Madam, I'm sorry.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why hasn't he come out yet?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where is he?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Madam, he doesn't want to come out.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yue.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Jiang Yue.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's wrong?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Jiang Yue, your father is still alive.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why are you angry with me?

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Jiang Yue, stop pretending to be a ghost.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come out.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Jiang Yue.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're wronged!

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Minister Jiang's daughter, Jiang Yue,

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
committed suicide in a murderous manner

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to restore Mingyue.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Minister Jiang's daughter, Jiang Yue,

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
committed suicide in a murderous manner

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I, Yang Zijin,

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
will protect Mingyue!

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry!

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Where is Xian'er?

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Where did she go?

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Where is Qiu Xian'er?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Did you find her?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where is Xiao Dorgon?

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Find her yourself!

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Find her at the third floor!

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes!

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Who is it?

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Come out!

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Who is it?

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who is it?

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who is laughing at me?

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know you are looking at me.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are looking at me all the time.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come out!

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come out!

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Come out!

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mr. Zhou,

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
His Majesty has something to ask you.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He ordered us to bring you into the palace.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your Highness,

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
please eat something.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Bring the late emperor's will.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But...

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Bring it here.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Please eat.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone knows that my father died

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and left me a will.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yin'er afraid that I'm dead.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But no one knew

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
what was written on the will.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually,

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's an empty letter made by the inner fire.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
stop crying, stop living!

104
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,480
Zhao Junlan!

105
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't bark like that!

106
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,480
Minister Jiang,

107
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,140
Elliott Xu's master,

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:15,380
absolutely can make anyone in this world

109
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,660
look as lost as r Short.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,180
No crying or crying, I felt a new life of them with me.

111
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
I was really thankful for them,

112
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,440
because I wouldn't have got away with my friends來成張轄的事情.

113
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,420
I want to go out.

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,580
I know you want to get some revenge.

115
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,020
But it is really up to you now to act as you like.

116
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,520
I've got lot of things to do too.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:14,760
the

118
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,100
do

119
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
I'm just a dying person.

120
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
No, Yunzhao.

121
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
I will always be with you.

122
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Ji Xiao has been working so hard to cure you.

123
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
If he hears you like this,

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
he might be angry at you.

125
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Good, you heartless Ji Yunzhao.

126
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Return my spiritual pill.

127
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I will return it.

128
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
I will return it.

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
I will return it.

130
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I will return it.

131
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
I will return it.

132
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
I will return it.

133
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Return my spiritual pill.

134
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,100
I'm leaving.

135
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Don't go out.

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
If there's anything,

137
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
tell me.

138
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Okay.

139
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Take care.

140
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Okay.

141
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
I will return it.

142
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Where is Zhang Zhao?

143
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
I want to see him.

144
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Why should I tell you?

145
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Why?

146
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
I want to see him.

147
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
What does the crown prince want?

148
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
To be protected by the military.

149
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
To be protected by the military.

150
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
To be protected by the military.

151
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
To be protected by the military.

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
To be protected by the military.

154
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
To be protected by the military.

155
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
To be protected by the military.

156
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
To be protected by the military.

157
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
To be protected by the military.

158
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
To be protected by the military.

159
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
To be protected by the military.

160
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
To be protected by the military.

161
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
To be protected by the military.

162
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
To be protected by the military.

163
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
To be protected by the military.

164
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
To be protected by the military.

165
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
To be protected by the military.

166
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
To be protected by the military.

167
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
To be protected by the military.

168
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
To be protected by the military.

169
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
To be protected

170
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
by the military.

171
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,100
To be protected by the military.

172
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
To be protected by the military.

173
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
To be protected by the military.

174
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
To be protected by the military.

175
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
To be protected by the military.

176
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
To be protected by the military.

177
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
I've waited for seven days.

178
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,900
I'm going out.

179
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,740
His Majesty has retreated, but there's blood flowing.

180
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Please wait a little longer.

181
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,660
I'll just walk around in this yard.

182
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I guess I can.

183
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Where did this come from?

184
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
This bed is called the bravest bed.

185
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Noble Lady Daguang of the capital is very good at cooking.

186
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
She's good at fighting.

187
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Maybe someone else raised her.

188
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
How did she escape from us?

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
She's about to die.

190
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
She's alive.

191
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Look.

192
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Everything has its own spirit.

193
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
How can you do this?

194

The fun of fighting is in the game.

If the winner is too early,

196
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
how can we have fun?

197
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
If he asks you for your hand right now,

198
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
it's not fun anymore.

199
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
It's for fun.

200
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100

201
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,100

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,180

Marquis of Shenyang, aren't you happy for me?

249
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,640
The death of a person who is old and sick is common in the mortal world.

250
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Why do you insist on it?

251
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640

The emperor said that I have a broken body.

263
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
He can't cure me.

264
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I will kill him.

265
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,640
