00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,040
Why didn't you discuss with me about the marriage you'll get to Jiang's?

4
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,120
What?

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,720
Are you blaming me for my own decision?

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,960
How could I?

7
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,800
I know you did this

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,960
to help me get rid of the marriage in Jiang's.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
But I promised you

10
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,440
I would never take it.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
You'd better think so.

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,600
Of course.

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
Ji Yunzhao,

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,680
don't be so proud.

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,480
You'll be the next one.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
Your Highness, be careful!

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Your Highness.

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,360
It seems the Lantern Festival tonight

19
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,320
will be very lively.

20
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,160
Your Highness!

21
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,560
Your Highness!

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Your Highness!

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,040
My little girl!

24
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,480
Stupid girl.

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Let's hold her.

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,240
Slower, suite!

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Hurry up!

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
I want it, too.

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,320
A traitor's son.

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,600
A wandering woman.

31
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,960
It's a perfect match.

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Perfect match.

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,160
My Lord, this is...

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,880
Didn't you hear them?

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,440
We are perfect match.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're being treated like a official.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,480
I feel sorry for you.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,680
It's okay.

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm used to

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,760
these idle talk.

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,040
My Lord,

42
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
at the lantern show later,

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,400
you must

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
light the jade lantern

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
in Princess Qingyang's hand.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,200
Princess Qingyang will die tonight.

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,520
You must stay away from her

48
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,720
to save her.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,480
Okay.

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
You're so lucky.

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Through all kinds of things,

52
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm sure

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,160
you can move to the future.

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,600
But

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,320
if you don't want to tell me,

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,840
I won't ask.

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,400
Five years ago,

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
I was lucky enough

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:24,340
to be a

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,300
prisoner

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,640
in Ji Cher打渣战.

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
Yes

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,560
The rumor has not gone as far as Channel Werewolf

64
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,120
宣鸢侯 spits out some nice gossip

65
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,200
Instead, they are afraid that other people don't know

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,880
that you are showing off

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
What madam Qiu has just said

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
you will have to blame Minister Zhou.

69
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,840
Minister Zhou,

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,120
do you admit that you are a spy?

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,880
You...

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,960
Marquis Xuan Ying, don't misunderstand.

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,840
That night,

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,640
Lady Ji helped me out

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,680
but she hurt Mingjie because of this.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240
I should have made it clear earlier.

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,920
I hope that Lady Ji will forgive me.

78
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,400
Kim Jong-il

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,160
I have taken

80
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
the apology from Minister Zhou.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
Princess Qingyang has shown up.

82
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,280
Princess Qingyang has come.

83
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Princess Qingyang has come.

84
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
I have a light here.

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,360
Whoever etwas right

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
the steel lantern and the curly flower lantern

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
will rule here.

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,200
This is just great.

89
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,600
Listen!

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,500
A faraway place is the starline everyone loves.

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,460
The firewood silver flower turn the sky's light.

92
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,720
The moon sheen turn' the field conference pictures all around you.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
The flower light shapejerks goals.

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
I go first!

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Were you working?

96
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,320
There' s a calamity

97
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,920
falling down and users areurgence.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,440
There' s laughter

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,640
In the garden of the government,

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,640
and tea and wine will be gifts of the real beauty.

101
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,360
Your Highness.

102
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
I'menth coming, too.

103
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,320
Please.

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,720
Jade ripens in a lake,

105
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,160
A show ofHmm It to be cut.

106
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,000
People and Mostly smile in true honor,

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,060

108
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,180
they

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,140

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
Come on, you're not my enemy.

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,640
Opposite me.

112
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
Li Zimeng?

113
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,780
No.

114
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,940
Chu Zhengyi.

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,160
Trust me.

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
My face

117
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
My face

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Little monkey, how dare you

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
How dare you hurt the princess

120
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Arrest her

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Yes

122
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
My face

123
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
How could this happen?

124
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
What's wrong?

125
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
When the Lantern Festival in Qingyang is in danger tonight

126
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Don't you ever try to save people

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
What did I notice?

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
You said that when the crown prince was in trouble

129
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Pei Yan took your credit

130
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
The way I taught you

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
The people of the Medicine Valley can't know

132
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
I mean

133
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Ji Yunzhao or Pei Yan

134
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
They are all innocent

135
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
I mean

136
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Ji Yunzhao or Pei Yan

137
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Have the ability to be like you

138
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I remember the original plan

139
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
I remember

140
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
It's Ji Yunzhao

141
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I understand

142
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
If Pei Yan continues to attack tonight

143
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
He will verify this guess

144
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Then we will

145
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Send him off

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Xuan Yinghou

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
You want to be a hero

148
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
But you hurt the princess's face

149
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
You took the risk

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
His majesty was furious

151
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
He ordered me to deliver the imperial edict

152
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
When will the princess's face recover?

153
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,160
When will you be released?

154
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
The old marquis is in good health

155
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Xuan Yinghou is a very good person

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
He is a good person

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
He is a good person

158
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
He is a good person

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
He is a good person

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
He is a good person

161
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
He is a good person

162
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
He is a good person

163
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
He is a good person

164
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Xuan Yinghou is the aunt of the old marquis

165
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
You are so considerate

166
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I deserve to die

167
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I deserve to die

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Why are you laughing?

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,360
I laugh at your

170
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Go get some water

171
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Help him wash

172
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Yes

173
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Do you know that

174
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
There is a way to kill people in prison

175
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,440
Play there

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,680
water

177
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,640
Between you and me

178
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,440
In whatever way

179
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
There is two sides to it

180
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,640
The price is Ireland

181
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,080
In whatever form

182
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
You draw the whole line

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,960
I'll wait until she can't hold on any longer.

184
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
Then I'll make her a

185
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,160
more severe wound.

186
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,680
Yes.

187
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
You're going to the prison?

188
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,560
I'm going to the court.

189
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
You're going to the prison?

190
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm going to the court.

191
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
You're going to the prison?

192
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm going to the court.

193
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
You're going to the prison?

194
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes.

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,440
As for Siqi and Qiuhua,

196
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,360
Qiuhua is the mostenanable.

197
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
She is fully eternally beautiful,

198
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
and she is the one who grounds 끈'èèèèèèçççç±£

200
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
So what?

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
Nothing is designed particularly when the character is locked up.

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,400
What if she's locked up Lun Chuan Chen and

203
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Hu Yan Nian I?

204
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,800
Carmen?

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Carmen.

206
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
She can't!

207
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,520
You and Qiu Xianer already know each other's background

208
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,800
You should be more cautious in the future

209
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,760
There is no Zhou Junlan in Dali Temple

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,400
Pei Yan is in prison now

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,760
I don't know how much he will suffer

212
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,640
I am the one who is involved in this

213
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
I must save him

214
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,000
Wait

215
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,040
Thank you, uncle

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,560
Remember to go home for dinner

217
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Ok

218
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,480
Your Highness

219
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,920
Lady Ji from Ji's Clinic wants to see you

220
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,120
Lady Ji

221
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,600
The fiancee of Marquis Xuan Yi, Ji Yunzhao

222
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,720
Yes

223
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,600
The rumour is that Lady Ji is good at medicine

224
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,040
She should...

225
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,840
Come in

226
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,960
Isn't it?

227
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,120
Of course

228
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,560
I don't know

229
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,080
So I don't know

230
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,760
Here

231
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,400
Xianer

232
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,800
What are you doing here?

233
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
I am here to share the tea with you

234
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,880
I don't know if I can do more of that.

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,720
I can't.

236
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,320
Your Kin,

237
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,200
können.

238
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,360
Elve in暗眼仙就不在手下.

239
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,240
It must be other places

240
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
that can let you out.

241
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,120
It must be others that can help.

242
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
First Class Attendant,

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,000
you have probably been still at the dead end

244
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
at the Wild Place

245
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Thank you.

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
We are willing to do anything.

247
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
We can help you with the case one day.

248
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
By the way, my lord.

249
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
The person you're looking for has a message.

250
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Where is he?

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,120
Suizhou.

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,400
But Suizhou is in a flood.

253
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
You're in this place.

254
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
Should we send someone to help?

255
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
No need.

256
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I want to...

257
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,680
find him myself.

258
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Please go back, my lady.

259
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I see.

260
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
You can't go in.

261
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm Jin Yunzhao.

262
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Greetings, your highness.

263
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I've been a doctor for many years.

264
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm very happy.

265
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
Hope you can help me.

266
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
OK.

272
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
I'll go.

273
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
Will you get my face?

274
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
Wow.

275
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,400
Even the royal physician is Natomiast.

276
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
So you'll get my face?

277
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,680
Exactly.

278
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,940
Please be honest.

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
How do I believe that?

280
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,080
If you don't believe...

281
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,220
Aren't you afraid of losing your woman?

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,720
I can heal my face

283
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,240
And also you

284
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,800

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,760
