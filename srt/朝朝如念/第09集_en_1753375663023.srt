The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,720
I worked so hard to win half a pound of silver

4
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,920
and you bought this?

5
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,240
Half a pound of silver is enough to buy this

6
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,480
You're lying

7
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,800
I could buy three bags of rice the day before yesterday

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Did you buy the silver again?

9
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,440
No

10
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,640
Did you buy it again?

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,680
I didn't

12
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,240
It's the same as when you hid the gold and silver treasure

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,360
I didn't find it

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,840
Did you not take it out even if you were dead?

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,480
Did you not take it out even if you were dead?

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
I really didn't

17
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,440
I only sold these

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
after I got the name of the Mi family

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,160
on the night of the auspicious day

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,040
Look at your mouth

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
Look at your mouth

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
Look at your mouth

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,960
Come

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
It hurts

25
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:14,120
My edges are לא

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:49,460
and take care of the

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
You even made your father cry!

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
Why are you so pale?

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm fine.

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,440
By the way, Doctor Ji,

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,880
how is Yuan?

32
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,480
He's still in a coma.

33
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,640
But he's much better now.

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,000
That's good.

35
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
Why are you blushing?

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,880
What's wrong?

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,760
Do you like him?

38
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,920
I don't.

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
I'm just concerned about him.

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,960
By the way,

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,000
how is the test of

42
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
the Spirit Snake Reconciliation Method I taught you?

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,640
I asked everyone in the County Office

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,960
to come to the Seven Flames Pavilion that night

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,000
and told them

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
there was a poisonous snake in the pavilion.

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,360
If they lied,

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,600
they would be buried in the pavilion.

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
The poisonous snake would bite them to death.

50
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
In fact, there was no poisonous snake in the pavilion.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Exactly.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
If someone is guilty of being a thief,

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
he will put a hand of the snake on the hand of Liu Huang

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,840
in advance to dispel the poisonous snake.

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
As long as the hand of this person

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,640
is put in the medicinal herb water,

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
it will turn slightly red.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,400
So...

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,640
The hand of the liar

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,160
turns red in the medicinal water,

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,800
right?

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,480
Yes.

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,440
But I've tested everyone in the County Office.

64
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,480
No one lied.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
You've tested them all?

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,080
Yes.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,600
All...

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,280
I don't know.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
There's one more person.

70
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Who?

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,600
Father.

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,720
You're overbearing!

73
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
You really dare...!

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
There was a poisonous snake in this pavilion,

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,440
the tangling looked ordinary.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,520
If the liar puts his hand in the pavilion,

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,800
he would be bitten by it

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
and the poisonous snake would bite him to death.

79
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
And you are shopping

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,600
for the snake.

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,960
I may go now.

82
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920
Do you dare to try it?

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,920
Where are you going again?

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm going to deliver the medicine.

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
I'll be back in a while.

86
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,240
No, Brother.

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,680
硬要应该不说话

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
I don't sound right, either.

89
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,160
Wendy,

90
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,560
you're having an affair

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
with a man.

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
It's all rather useless to try

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,680
and resist your love

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,320
instead of it.

95
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Dini,

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
He must have come to Suizhou.

97
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
It turns out that you are here.

98
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,040
The show is about to start.

99
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,640
What...

100
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
I don't know him.

102
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
He wanted to kill the people.

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,840
I...

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
You bitch!

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
I... I don't know him.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,240
Who are you?

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Get out of my way!

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,640
Or I'll kill you too!

109
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,640
How is it?

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,640
Is your heart healed?

111
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,440
It's done.

112
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,040
It's done.

113
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Doctor Ji,

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
you're really a good doctor.

115
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
Stop talking nonsense.

116
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
How did you deal with him?

117
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,240
There's a cry in the yard.

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Really?

119
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Ya'er,

120
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
stop talking nonsense.

121
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
There must be a chance to escape.

122
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm still alive.

123
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,240
I finally got rid of this evil spirit.

124
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
But my illness

125
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,440
is gone with my illness.

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
I don't need to pay the debt.

127
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
I don't need to be beaten.

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,640
I don't need to be beaten.

129
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
I don't need to be beaten.

130
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,240
I don't need to be beaten.

131
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
I don't need to be beaten.

132
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm scared.

133
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
His house,

134
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
his land,

135
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,040
his money, his life,

136
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
they're all mine.

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
They're all mine.

138
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,640
They're all mine.

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
If anything happens to Dongchuan,

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,040
will you

141
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
blame me for everything?

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
No, no.

143
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,240
I swear I won't.

144
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,640
Why do I feel like

145
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,440
he can still move?

146
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,040
I'll kill you.

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
It's okay.

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
It's okay.

149
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
When I put the lid on,

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
no one will notice.

151
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,440
The last question.

152
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
What?

153
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,040
What is more annoying than love?

154
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
What are you doing?

155
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
It's hate.

156
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Hate

157
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,240
is a thousand times more annoying than love.

158
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,440
It's like I'm thinking about you.

159
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,440
You...

160
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
You... You are...

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
How are you,

162
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,840
Sun Fengxi?

163
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
Gu Chacheng.

164
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
On the day of the wedding,

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,240
you didn't save me.

166
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
You even pushed me down the cliff.

167
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,040
I still remember

168
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
you were standing on the cliff

169
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
and counting money.

170
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
You're laughing.

171
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,440
Why aren't you laughing?

172
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
But I think

173
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
you look

174
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
prettier

175
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
than you are now.

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
They forced me.

177
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
They forced me.

178
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,040
Then you deserve to die.

179
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
If others ask,

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,240
you'll say

181
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
I forced you to kill your own husband.

182
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
No.

183
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
I can prove it for you.

184
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
I can prove you wrong.

185
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,840
I can tell the world.

186
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,240
I can tell them

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
you didn't kill him.

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,240
I...

189
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,840
That's not what I want.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
I can give you

191
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,040
whatever you want.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
What I want

193
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
is a good reward.

194
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,240
A good reward.

195
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
You too?

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Help me.

197
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm begging you.

198
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440

Help me.

207
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,240
The wind blows,

208
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,640
the dragon flies,

209
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,840
the river flows.

210
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,840
The sea of clouds,

211
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
me and you,

212
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,640
can only look out.

213
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,040
The sun,

214
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
the rain,

215
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,640
how can it escape from the clouds?

216
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
The wind,

217
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
the rain,

218
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,640
how can it escape from the clouds?

219
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Can you and I

220
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,040
still look out?

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
The rain,

222
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
how can it escape from the clouds?

223
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
The past life,

224
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
how can it escape from the clouds?

225
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
What are you doing here?

226
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
I'm looking for you.

227
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
The wind,

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,640
how can it escape from the clouds?

229
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
I'm here to deliver medicine.

230
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
What are you doing here?

231
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,240
I'm here to

232
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,040
cover the wind and block the rain.

233
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,640
You're so talkative.

234
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
Black-smiled cat.

235
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Black-smiled cat?

236
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Are you scared?

237
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
No.

238
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
I thought

239
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,840
you were so bold

240
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
that nothing could scare you.

241
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Black-smiled cat,

242
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
is it cold?

243
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
The cloud,

244
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
you're so worried.

245
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Can it escape from the clouds?

246
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
The wind,

247
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
how can it escape from the clouds?

248
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
The wind,

249
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,640
smoke the紅袍

250
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,420
into a smoke.

251
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,640
It's like bread

252
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,440
and eyes

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,840
is gazing at me.

254
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I love you so much

255
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
and wish you

256
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
to remember it as our dream.

257
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,720
Make your political decision

258
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,700
I will help you

259
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,720
Time to set off

260
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,020
You guys should hurry

261
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,380
Farewell

262
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,460

Thanks for watching!
