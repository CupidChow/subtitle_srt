00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Qiu Xian!

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
I've thought it through!

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
Come out!

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
Qiu Xian!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Qiu Xian!

8
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,720
If I die now,

9
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
will you be hopeless?

10
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Come out!

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
You've thought it through?

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Since the day I left the Pavilion,

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
no.

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,040
Since we met each other,

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,000
you've been manipulating me.

16
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,040
When you could

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,520
kill me with one move,

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
you let me go.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,000
You pushed me to the end,

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
and now you want me to fight back?

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
Until now,

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
I've always won.

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,080
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Yes.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,280
So what?

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Why?

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,240
You were only seven when we first met.

28
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,640
Seven!

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
How could a seven-year-old child

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,920
be so far-sighted?

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
What are you?

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm a person who only knows how to write.

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm a person who only knows how to write.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,440
You and this world

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,200
are nothing more than stories I wrote.

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
You're an outsider.

37
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,160
Why did you appear in this book?

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
I wrote half of it,

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,160
but I lost my sense of inspiration.

40
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
I had to write it down.

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
I closed my eyes that night.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,000
I was born as a child when I opened my eyes.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
I became Qiu Xiang.

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,040
We only knew the first half of the future

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,240
because I only wrote half of the story.

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,000
I stopped the rebellion of Runan.

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,440
From now on,

48
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,600
we all know nothing about the future.

49
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
Then why is it me?

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Why are you against me?

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,040
You killed all my friends and relatives.

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm a supporting role.

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,920
You're the leading role.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm stupid, weak, and shameless.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,800
I took everything away from you

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,080
to make you hate me

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
and make you suffer.

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,920
So we can work together

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,680
to write this perfect ending.

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
We'll rebel against the world

61
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,320
and become the kings.

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,240
That's it.

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,280
Listen to the imperial rules in well-mannered father,

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,840
and respect the emperor,

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,880
and we'll kill all rebels.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,680
Place the horse.

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,760
He has an intravene.

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
I'll kill myself.

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,440
This is the hairband I specially embroidered

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
when I waited for you to come back.

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,040
Do you like it?

72
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
I found it.

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,200
You rarely remind me of your past.

74
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,200
When all the sorrow is settled,

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
I'll tell you.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
It's a deal.

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
It's a deal.

78
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,080
It's a deal.

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,680
How florous the place!

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
How fragrant the air.

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
As the blue marriage Bridal Mask!

82
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm taking it now.

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
No blood stain on the head.

84
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,560
That check looks석 ви recording it.

85
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Zhou Junlan assume all set to take this.

86
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,760
So brave and calming.

87
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,040
Three months later,

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
you were sealed as the queen,

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,520
but you were ill that night and passed away.

90
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
All of this

91
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
is destined to happen to you.

92
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,480
When a man is against the will of the heavens,

93
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,880
there is no way out.

94
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,160
I don't believe in destiny.

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm the only one

96
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,360
who can decide my fate.

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,640
Nie Pan came back to the capital to revenge.

98
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,200
He saved the people of Xuanhu.

99
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,480
He saved the people of Mingyuan.

100
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,640
He died for nothing.

101
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
He died for nothing.

102
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
The reason why I'm standing here today

103
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,640
is not your fault,

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,360
but my own.

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,480
I risked my life to get out of it.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,440
I can change the past,

107
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,640
but I can't change the future.

108
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
You're just a lowly maid.

109
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
You want to change your fate against the will of the heavens?

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
The world is big.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
I deserve to be praised.

112
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,480
So what?

113
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm just a lowly maid

114
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,040
who has been to the sea and the mountains.

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,560
I can change the future.

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you know

117
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,120
your ambition

118
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,600
is also part of my destiny?

119
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
It's not decided yet.

120
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,440
It's not known yet.

121
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
I, Ji Yunche,

122
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,800
will never be your servant.

123
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,040
I'm the master of fate.

124
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,560
Are you crazy?

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,320
I won.

126
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,320
Even if I die,

127
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm not as good as you want me to be.

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,560
No.

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
No.

130
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,040
You're just a little bit worse than me.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Just a little bit.

132
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm looking for you.

133
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
How dare you fool me like this?

134
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Since I stepped on the golden road,

135
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,440
I've been almost poisoned by the poison.

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,760
My friends and relatives

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
are all young and old.

138
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,840
They all left me.

139
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,160
Now I'm going to die

140
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,080
along with them.

141
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,800
You can't die.

142
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,560
I'm so grateful to you.

143
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,600
I love you so much.

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,080
Zhang Cheng.

145
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,280
You can't.

146
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,880
You've always been chattering

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,320
so much and I'll never lose to you again.

148
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,240
immaterial,

149
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
who can you be?

150
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Your Majesty...

151
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,680
All right.

152
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Very good.

153
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,120
The sword of lending

154
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
goes back to you!

155
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
student

156
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,080
Lamowy

157
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,080
to the throne.

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,160
Long live the emperor!

159
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,400
You heard the story of Ou He.

160
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,920
You haven't heard the story of Ou He.

161
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
Long, long ago,

162
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,600
Nezha

163
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,640
offended the dragon king

164
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
and punished himself.

165
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,720
He used Zhenzhen to find Lotus Robe

166
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,000
to be his body.

167
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Before that,

168
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,160
Nezha

169
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
took the dragon sword

170
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
of the son of the dragon king,

171
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,280
and Ou Bing died.

172
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,120
That day,

173
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Nezha and Ou Bing

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
were in the heaven and were in fear.

175
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,800
They were in a big group

176
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,640
and became Ou Bing.

177
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
From now on,

178
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
is Ou Bing

179
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
the only one left?

180
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,560
Good words got the better of those who said to disobey God.

181
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,360
Why do you cry, requires?

182
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,480
If

183
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,080
we all let go of the hatred,

184
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,480
газ

185
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,580
amid choosing my arrangement?

186
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,580
Find the answer

187
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,880
All looking forward to

188
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,920
advances

189
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,440
looking forward to

190
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,740

191
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,820
to

192
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
the missions

193
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,140
for all to one day

194
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,380
Yun Shang,

195
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,260
let's go back.

196
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,860
Spinal players.

197
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,720
Father.

198
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,560
Wu Shao Shao.

199
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,640
Ji Yun Zhao.

200
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,880
You did it, didn't you?

201
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
You ruined my perfect ending.

202
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,240
Come out!

203
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Come out!

204
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,040
Ji Yicheng.

205
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,440
The patient in room 6 is looking for the doctor.

206
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,920
Ji Yicheng!

207
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,840
Zhou Qianlan.

208
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,560
You're not dead.

209
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,160
We're rebels.

210
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,360
We deserve to die.

211
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,880
You're not rebels. You're just a patient.

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,720
Calm down.

213
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm...

214
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,560
I'm the one who created the world.

215
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,800
I...

216
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
I know nothing.

217
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I can't do anything.

218
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,120
I'm...

219
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,720
Listen to me.

220
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,120
You're trapped in the obsession of creating a perfect story.

221
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
You sit at the table every day and write.

222
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
Three years, five years, seven years.

223
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
You're getting more and more stubborn.

224
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,080
You know?

225
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm exhausted.

226
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,280
Chao Chao.

227
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
You're not dead.

228
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,280
No.

229
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,800
No.

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
You shouldn't be here.

231
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,720
You're the one who wants to be the empress.

232
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,920
How can you be here?

233
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,720
Give her a peace-making shot.

234
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
You shouldn't be here.

235
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
It's true.

236
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,560
It's true.

237
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,680
It's not my story.

238
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
It's true.

239
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,280
You're back.

240
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,160
Come and take revenge on me.

241
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
Come on.

242
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,400
Come on.

243
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,000
Hold her.

244
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,040
What are you doing?

245
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,040
Help.

246
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,640
Help.

247
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,120
One final shot.

248
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,680
For me.

249
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
For you.

250
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I will never give up

251
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I will never give up

252
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
I will never give up

253
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I will never give up

254
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I will never give up

255
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I will never give up

256
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
I will never give up

257
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I will never give up

258
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I will never give up

259
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
I will never give up

260
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
I will never give up

261
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
I will never give up

262
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
I will never give up

263
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
I will never give up

264
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
I will never give up

265
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
I will never give up

266
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
I will never give up
