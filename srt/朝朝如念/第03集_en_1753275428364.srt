00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,200
My Lord, are you waiting for me?

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,000
Aren't you my fiancee?

5
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
I thought you would be angry.

6
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,560
You are a good girl.

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,480
How can I be angry?

8
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Thank you for helping me out.

9
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,080
It's not fair.

10
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
It's just my goodwill.

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,680
I have nothing to say.

12
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,880
I can only give you a gift.

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,880
What?

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,080
A drop of blood.

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,640
Let's go.

16
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,920
How did you get here?

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm not talented.

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,720
I must have some way to save my life.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
My Lord, how do you deal with him?

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,880
You sent someone to spy on me?

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
When did you start?

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Since you started to spy on me,

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,080
what's your intention

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
to approach me?

25
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,440
You forgot

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,160
that I told you

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
that I traveled a thousand miles

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,480
from the east of the dragon to the spring,

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
only to come here

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,680
to give you a key.

31
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Five years ago, on the 19th of the last month,

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,560
Zhou Junlan reported that he wanted to collude with your father.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,360
The emperor was furious and the rebels were on the run.

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
The late Marquis's body

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,080
was hanging on the wall for ten days.

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,160
He was also being beaten to death.

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
I got it.

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
Get off me,

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Secret Circuit.

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
Shiyi.

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,480
Move back.

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,360
What do you want to say?

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,400
In the past five years,

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,760
Zhao Junlan has been helping His Majesty

45
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
to get out of the trap and make contributions.

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,480
It's like he has a magic wand.

47
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,640
But, My Lord,

48
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,200
is there really a magic wand in this world?

49
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
Please, Immortal.

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Please, My Lord.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,360
He is innocent.

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Please, Immortal.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
Please, My Lord.

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,880
Please, My Lord.

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,680
Please, Immortal.

56
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,720
Please, My Lord.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
He is innocent.

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
Please, Immortal.

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
Please, My Lord.

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,640
If there is a magic wand,

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,080
His Lordship will not be born as a horse

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
but will die in the dark.

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,600
He won't be born in the winter.

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
If there is a magic wand,

65
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,080
Madam Pei will not die in the dark.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,920
On the Mid-Autumn Festival night,

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,520
the lights of all the families are lit.

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,080
You

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,160
have lost your only lover.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Have you ever thought about

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,240
who is helping Zhao Junlan?

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,680
Zhao Junlan is not an ordinary person.

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,080
He has no one depending on it.

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
He can have his magic wand

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,560
but he can die for this light as well.

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,640
Do you really want to wipe my blood off my face?

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
Just take your place.

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,120
Don't look down.

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,320
There is a glimmer of moonlight in front of you.

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,480
One inch of moonlight

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
You have surrendered to the government

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Who is the one who ordered you to kill?

83
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Otherwise you will die of a broken liver and intestine

84
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Don't think about it

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
You are not afraid of death

86
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Then I will give you the antidote

87
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Wait

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
You mean

89
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
You mean

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
The assassin not only failed

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
But also ordered me to go to the government

92
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Yes

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Who will believe the words of the evil?

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Besides, he should be shut up forever

95
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
You are so quick

96
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
I am just a doctor

97
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Why do I need to be a doctor?

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
You believe he is Ji Yunzhao?

99
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Whether it is Ji Yunzhao or Gu Zhao Zhao

100
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
It's just a little bit

101
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,480
But he is forced to come back from the central office

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
He must have prepared

103
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
With the ability of Xian'er to help me

104
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
What can he do?

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
The position of central office will not be wrong

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Now you have a chance

107
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
You should be sure

108
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Tomorrow at the time of birth

109
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
The crown prince will sneak out of the palace

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
To check the road

111
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
At that time

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Sir, slow down

113
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Be careful not to fall

114
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Sir

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Sir

116
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Sir

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Hurry up, go to the doctor

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Hurry up

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Sir

120
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
What's wrong with you?

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Sir

122
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Sir

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Remember

124
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I can only save him by teaching you

125
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
How can he do Xian'er's way?

126
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Sir

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Your Highness, are you ok?

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Are you ok?

129
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Today, it's all thanks to Xuan Yinghou

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
It's just a matter of internal affairs

131
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,480
If Zhou Shilang finds out about the crown prince

132
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
He will also help

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Thank you, Zhou Shilang

134
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
It's my pleasure

135
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Sir

136
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Sir

137
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
I'll get you more

138
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Thank you

139
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
After today

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm afraid there are many people

141
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
To come to the crown prince's rescue

142
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
There are people and there are ways

143
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Xuan Yinghou must have a way out

144
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Today you asked me to come here for tea

145
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm afraid you can't go

146
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
I'm afraid you can't go

147
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm afraid you can't go

148
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm afraid you can't go

149
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Today you asked me to come here for tea

150
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm afraid it's not a coincidence that you met the crown prince

151
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
It's just a coincidence

152
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Zhou Junlan has been through all kinds of coincidences and coincidences for five years

153
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Step by step

154
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I heard that it was because he was at home

155
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
A god who can tell the future

156
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
You can also tell the future

157
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,480
You want to deal with Zhou Junlan or the god behind him?

158
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
They had a fight last night

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
They had a fight last night

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
You are so naughty today

161
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
What?

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Are you afraid?

163
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
I didn't hide

164
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,480
The first thing they want is to get revenge on me

165
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
What are you afraid of?

166
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
You should be afraid

167
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
What?

168
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
You should be afraid

169
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm afraid of you

170
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
What?

171
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
You don't want to die

172
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
You don't want to live

173
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
You want to die

174
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
But you are a girl

175
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
You are so beautiful

176
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
How can you not die?

177
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
I'm not beautiful

178
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Gu Zhao Zhao died five years ago

179
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Now Ji Yunzhao is just a dog

180
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,480
You were so beautiful in the restaurant that day

181
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Madam Ji

182
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
No matter who you want to kill

183
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Nothing is worth killing you

184
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Gu Zhao Zhao

185
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Madam Ji

186
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Who are you?

187
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm Zhou Junlan

188
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I don't know you

189
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
You had a fight with that man a few days ago

190
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I see

191
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,480
You are here today for your wife's assassination

192
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
It's just a misunderstanding

193
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Maybe it's because of the fight between you and Xuan Ying Duke

194
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Madam Ji is with Xuan Ying Duke

195
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
She loves me in secret

196
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Do you have any grudge against me and Xian?

197
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Why are you laughing?

198
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm laughing

199
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
You also climbed out of that rotten mud

200
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
You ask such a stupid question

201
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
You are so impudent

202
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Do I have to have a reason to deal with you?

203
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
You just blocked my way

204
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
There is only one way to get to the sky

205
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
What? You can't go

206
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
I can't go

207
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,480
You didn't think that one day

208
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
You will also become someone else's cornerstone?

209
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Zhou Shila

210
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
We will meet again

211
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Junlan

212
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
We will meet again

213
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Who are you?

214
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
I will say it again

215
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
I am the daughter of the valley master of the Apothecary Valley

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Ji Yunzhao
