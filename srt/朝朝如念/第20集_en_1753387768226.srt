00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,000
On the day of the stars,

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,280
I was standing under the city wall.

5
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Before my father died,

6
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
he repeated the same words.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
This heart can be seen.

8
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,840
The feelings are unchanging.

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,280
The lonely dust can be seen.

10
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,040
But never

11
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,320
be seen.

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,280
His blood was dripping on my face.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
It was still warm.

14
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,120
From then on,

15
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
I dared not watch the play again.

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
Yunzhao.

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm here.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,040
I know that you are useless.

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,600
But this place

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,880
is buried with my father's ashes.

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
I know.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,280
This has always been the way of the heaven.

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
But can Heaven

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,120
tell me

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
what is right

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
and what is wrong?

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,160
Zhao Yan is the one who sent the South.

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,040
Zhao Yan is the one who killed the North.

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,640
He was killed by the blood-red fox.

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,880
He was guilty of deceiving the army.

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,120
Once we catch him,

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
we'll punish him on the spot.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,720
Kill him without mercy.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,440
Yes.

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,600
Master.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,440
Pack up.

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,160
Go.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,120
What's wrong?

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,920
Hurry.

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,760
Where are you going?

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,040
Can I call San Yue?

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
The Demon King Valley.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
Run.

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Pei Yan.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Pei Yan.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Pei Yan.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Look at me.

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
Wake up.

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,440
You can only make a change

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,480
if you live.

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,040
وا.

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,880
I saw you!

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,000
I haven't seen you for a while.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Come closer.

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,720
Where have you been?

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,280
I take you to see Н世asın.

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,880
Where?

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,600
isetcómo?

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,920
Before I go into the netherworld

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,020
do you think

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,940
Yes, Your Majesty

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,140
The smoke just now

63
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,020
has been put out

64
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,740
The palace is no better than the battlefield

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,020
It's a terrible place

66
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,020
The master is in a coma

67
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,820
Where can the people below

68
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,940
go in a hurry?

69
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,260
Zhao Yan, are you still alive?

70
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,140
My name is

71
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,220
Song Nanfei

72
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,820
I'll leave the rest to you

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay

74
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,860
Let's go

75
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,020
Let's go

76
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,140
to Nanfei

77
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,620
When I was young, when I was growing up

78
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,100
I met just another man

79
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,300
who was wonderful

80
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,100
Now I'm the one

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,060
I want you to take care of

82
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,220
You've just missed me

83
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,220
You bet

84
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,900
Thank you

85
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,900
Little Master.

86
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,380
Why is Lady Ji here?

87
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,380
Father.

88
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,700
Mother.

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,340
I'm not filial.

90
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,420
I knew it.

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,300
I knew you were Zhao Zhao.

92
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,220
Get up.

93
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,220
Get up.

94
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,500
Get up.

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,980
Lady.

96
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,500
The three of us

97
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,020
can finally be reunited.

98
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,540
Zhao Zhao.

99
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,300
Yun Zhao.

100
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,940
Zhao Zhao.

101
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,540
Zhao Zhao.

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:43,940
Yun Zhao.

103
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,660
Zhao Zhao.

104
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,660
Zhao Zhao.

105
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,060
Yun Zhao.

106
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,780
Zhao Zhao.

107
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
What happened, Ji Xiao?

108
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,180
Zhao Zhao.

109
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,900
Yun Zhao.

110
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,100
Zhao Zhao.

111
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,740
Ji Xiao.

112
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,900
Ji Xiao.

113
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,580
Então ?

114
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
So week!

115
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,540
GO.

116
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
Where is Ji Yun Zhao?

117
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,660
She and Marquis Xuan Yin came out of the capital.

118
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,620
The officials are looking for her.

119
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,780
Trash.

120
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,980
They are trash.

121
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,140
Everything you can't remember

122
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,660
or remember

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,860
is because of me.

124
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,660
What's the point of

125
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
a slap?

126
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,060
Do you know that if His Majesty knows about it,

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,500
it's a serious crime?

128
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
A murder?

129
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,260
A murder?

130
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,180
Do you know that

131
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,100
I set the rules

132
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,020
for the murder?

133
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,660
Do you know that

134
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,860
I was born with a bad luck?

135
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,700
When the Dao is born,

136
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,460
the Yi is born,

137
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,420
the San is born,

138
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,260
and the Wan is born.

139
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,780
The world is...

140
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
It's me!

141
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,100
How do you know that?

142
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,860
I can't be in the position of imperial guard,

143
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,980
but I know you well.

144
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,580
Not only you,

145
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
but also His Majesty,

146
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
Qingyang,

147
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,540
Pei Yan, Ji Yunzhao.

148
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,220
I know what you're thinking.

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,900
You don't know that

150
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,900
even Ji Yunzhao can see the future

151
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,740
in his dream.

152
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,580
I gave him all these.

153
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,300
Are you crazy?

154
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Yes.

155
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,140
I'm crazy.

156
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,860
Ji Yunzhao is gone.

157
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,100
My work is not perfect.

158
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,020
I'm so painful that I'm going crazy.

159
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,220
It's okay.

160
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,980
You're sick.

161
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,860
You're acting.

162
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,300
I'll find a way to save you.

163
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,420
As long as you're fine,

164
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,780
everything else doesn't matter.

165
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,740
At worst,

166
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,020
we can start over.

167
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,900
No.

168
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,460
No.

169
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,700
It's almost over.

170
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,460
We don't need to

171
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,660
be in the same boat anymore.

172
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,940
What do you want?

173
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,460
Can't you just say it?

174
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm telling you now.

175
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,540
What else do you want?

176
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,340
Everyone?

177
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,860
Who?

178
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,380
Han'er.

179
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,340
But I can't see them.

180
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,620
But they

181
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,340
are sitting there.

182
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,620
Okay.

183
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,740
Then let me ask you.

184
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,780
Our future

185
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,320
is fancy and media

186
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,640
with their osób suspiciousness.

187
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,740
They...

188
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,220
Who

189
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:33,700
What happened to boom dream you killed your

190
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,120
sister abroad with?

191
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,120
I will definitely get you back.

192
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,320
Isn't this in the Medicine King Valley?

193
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,520
Aren't you a divine doctor?

194
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,320
That's his old poison.

195
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
There's no cure for it.

196
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,520
I can only use poison to poison.

197
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,920
I can use Yue Yue's poison to release the blood.

198
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,320
But that poison will eventually enter the heart.

199
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,520
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

200
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
It was me.

201
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,320
Zhao Zhao.

202
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
Yun Zhao.

203
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,920
I didn't let him say it.

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,720
Wait for me. I'll go find you a better doctor.

205
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,920
Pei Yan, I am a doctor.

206
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
This disease...

207
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,720
is incurable.

208
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
The medicine can't cure it. There's still the side-effects.

209
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
There's also the magic of the witch's bone. It can definitely be cured.

210
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,720
Then what's the meaning of me and that wedding king?

211
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I am just a useless person.

212
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,920
No one can save me.

213
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,720
The world, the world, my father,

214
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,720
and you.

215
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
You've already done very well.

216
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Don't cry.

217
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Look at Zhao Zhao. She's pale.

218
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,720
I'll find some good rouge for you to paint.

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Zhao Zhao is still pretty.

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Okay.

221
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll go find her.

222
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Zhao Zhao.

223
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Zhao Zhao.

224
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Zhao Zhao.

225
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Zhao Zhao.

226
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Zhao Zhao.

227
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Zhao Zhao.

228
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Zhao Zhao.

229
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Zhao Zhao.

230
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Zhao Zhao.

231
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Zhao Zhao.

232
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Zhao Zhao.

233
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Zhao Zhao.

234
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Zhao Zhao.

235
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Zhao Zhao.

236
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
You're sleepy?

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I'll carry you back to sleep.

238
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I'm just thinking about something.

239
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
What are you thinking about?

240
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm thinking about the knife that Zhou Jun Lan and Qiu Xian Er owed me.

241
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,720
That year, I was poisoned by a strange poison and fell off the cliff.

242
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
It was the magic of the medicine that took me back to the Medicine King Valley.

243
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
That poison was incurable.

244
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
It was only worth using it to poison.

245
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Every 15th of the month,

246
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I had to bear the pain of the poison.

247
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I had a lot of hatred in my heart.

248
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
It was as if I was dying.

249
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Now that I'm about to die,

250
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,720
I'll leave the knife that they owed me to you.

251
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
You...

252
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720
want me to go back?

253
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
You always want to go back, don't you?

254
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,720
You can't let go of the world.

255
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,720
It's as if I can't let go of hatred.

256
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,720
We're just trying to deceive ourselves.

257
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,720
The pain of life and the death of happiness.

258
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,720
What do you choose?

259
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I...

260
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,720
There are only two ways in front of me.

261
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,720
The pain of death and the death of happiness.

262
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I can only choose the latter.

263
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,720
You're different, Pei Yan.

264
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
You can live.

265
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
You'd rather suffer.

266
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Don't be numb.

267
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Don't be numb.

268
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I once wanted to die.

269
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Heaven wanted me to live.

270
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Now I want to live.

271
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Heaven wants me to die.

272
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I can only think about it.

273
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
It's fine.

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
One day,

275
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,720
the living will avenge me.

276
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
But I can't believe it.

277
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
The sword of revenge is in my hand.

278
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,720
I can't hold it.

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Fate is deceiving.

280
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I was fooled by the world.

281
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
I was fooled by the ancient sword.

282
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
But why?

283
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Who is deceiving me?

284
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
If I can stand up again,

285
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
even if I die,

286
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I'll bite him.

287
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Pei Yan.

288
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Do whatever you want.

289
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Just do it.

290
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Now I have no money, no power,

291
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
no soldiers, no horses.

292
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
The court is hunting me.

293
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I can only turn the situation around

294
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
if I'm alone.

295
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,720
I want to accompany you to the end.

296
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Then I'll change my name and change my shape.

297
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll join the Western Liang Army.

298
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
I'll take the oath.

299
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
I'll fight.

300
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
I'll die.

301
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Remember.

302
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,720
There's also my sword.

303
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Yes.

304
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
And...

305
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
that sword.

306
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,720
The End
