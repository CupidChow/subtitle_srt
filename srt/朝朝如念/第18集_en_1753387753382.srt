00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,240
It hurts.

4
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,920
Your wound is already healed.

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,000
It should be almost healed.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,160
My head hurts.

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,720
The flower costs 27 taels

8
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,120
at Chunhua's place.

9
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,520
This is Zhao Peng's account book.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,640
I know.

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,560
How is it?

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
Do you have any clues?

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,680
Back then,

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
my father was robbed of the painting.

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,920
He painted the picture

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,920
behind the two soldiers

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,680
and destroyed the city's defense map.

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,480
To prevent the two of them from colluding,

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,680
my father

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,400
asked the two of them to hide their identities from each other.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,560
In the camp,

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,840
they should avoid

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,080
contact with each other.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,400
Then we should kick out the soldiers

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,320
who were in contact with Zhao Peng

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,760
and then investigate other soldiers.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
As for the remaining soldiers,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
I've sent someone to investigate them secretly.

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,320
Now,

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,840
only the people on the list

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,080
haven't been able to investigate.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
They were involved in this case

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,440
and have guarded Western Liang for many years.

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,360
A few days ago,

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,080
I should have led the troops there.

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,120
But now,

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,920
it's all over.

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,520
You should have.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
Western Liang

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
is against it.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Is it because His Majesty

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
doesn't want to send more soldiers?

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,720
Yes.

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,880
Western Liang's army

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
has a deep relationship with the local people.

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,240
The tiger people came to the court

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,560
and retreated without fighting.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
General Zhang Zhao of Western Liang

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
led the local people to attack the tiger people

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
and kick them out.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
De Sheng didn't withdraw his troops

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
and went south.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,800
He

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
rebelled.

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,080
I've never heard of this in the capital.

56
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,040
This is about the country's situation.

57
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
How dare the court

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
tell the master?

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
Three days ago,

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,600
Western Liang's army broke into the city

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
and attacked three times a day.

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,440
I've heard that Zhang Zhao is brave and brave,

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,600
but he's not good enough.

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
He's been living with the late Marquis Pei for a long time.

65
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,520
They didn't get along.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,320
I didn't expect

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,120
they would grow up like this.

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,880
He's not the one who's in trouble.

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,440
It's Consort Song.

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,320
Who is Consort Song?

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,520
General of Western Liang has a late marquis

72
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,000
who is a good strategist.

73
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
You're afraid?

74
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm afraid that His Majesty is too afraid of me

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,160
and he'll hand the case of suppressing the rebels

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
to Pei Yan.

77
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,480
Now,

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
he's in a bad situation

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
under the help of Ji Yunzhao.

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
If he has the power to help the gods,

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,040
the position of the court is getting higher and higher.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
How can I balance the situation?

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,520
City inventory,

84
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
can you look at this?

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,280
How can I manage the situation

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,720
under the help of Ji Yunzhao?

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Xian Er.

88
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
Quickly put it away.

89
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
The coup plan is urgent

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,800
and His Majesty will announce financed the scenarios tomorrow.

91
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,520
Now that you've figured out the future,

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,920
can you tell me now

93
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,920
who will be sent by Pei Yan?

94
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,560
I don't know.

95
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,160
Ever since I dreamed of Ru Nan's death,

96
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,680
I've never had a dream.

97
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Maybe God has taken back his grace.

98
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,360
I can't help you.

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,600
It's okay.

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,480
You've done a good job so far.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,960
He's the leader, I'm the only one.

102
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Now my pre-wisdom ability is gone.

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,480
Will he predict my future?

104
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
Will he predict my future?

105
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,840
Your hand.

106
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,240
Understand?

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Well...

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,040
Don't make me repeat it.

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,400
Okay.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
No matter what happens,

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,560
the palace has already set the ordinary people.

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,080
You want to go?

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes.

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
To stabilize the country,

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
and to ease the injustice of father.

116
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,480
But your blood pressure is not yet good.

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,480
I'll be on duty.

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't.

119
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,240
Then try it.

120
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Okay.

121
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,280
How did you do it?

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,960
Because I'm very strong.

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll try it, too.

124
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,480
You go.

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
Right?

126
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,960
You're strong at heart, too.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,920
Because your heart is beating painfully.

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
Will you be tired?

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
I will.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,960
Okay.

131
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,920
I won't leave you hungry.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,080
Alright.

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
I don't know how to kneel.

134
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,440
Why?

135
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
I've been married to you for years.

136
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,920
I've figured out

137
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,560
your temperament

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,840
to make people kneel.

139
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
I ordered a few guards

140
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,240
to make you kneel

141
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
so that you can kneel.

142
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,520
It's easy for me

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,360
to kneel.

144
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,720
You rarely mention

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
your hometown to me.

146
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,720
When everything is settled,

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
I'll tell you.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
It's a deal.

149
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,640
You don't have to kneel to me anymore.

150
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,760
Then my life savings

151
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
will be in vain.

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,920
You're still kneeling to me, right?

153
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
How could I?

154
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,840
It's a deal.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
By the will of heaven,

156
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
the emperor has decreed

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,840
that there are rebels

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,560
and they're not allowed to Page 19.

159
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,800
This will happen again tomorrow.

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
Yes,ER !

161
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Yes,ER !

162
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
Then actively

163
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,720
coaching Senator Zhou

164
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:11,020
to take Bu

165
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,020
We have been away from the West Liang's rebel army for more than half a month

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
The West Liang's rebel army has been through many battlefields

167
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
We can't be stopped

168
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
We have been badly injured

169
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Your Majesty

170
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
Your Majesty

171
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,020
Your Majesty

172
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
Call for the Taoist priest

173
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,020
Your Majesty

174
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Call for the Taoist priest

175
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Taoist priest

176
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
This thing

177
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,020
Can it be guaranteed to live a long life?

178
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Yes

179
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,020
This thing is called Guiyuan Pill

180
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,020
It is the pure blood of the world

181
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,020
It will be made in seven days

182
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,020
Congratulations, Your Majesty

183
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,020
The West Liang's rebel army has been through many battlefields

184
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,020
The West Liang's rebel army has been through many battlefields

185
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Great

186
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Great

187
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Send my order to the Zhou family

188
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,020
I embroidered this hairband on purpose when I waited for you

189
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Do you like it?

190
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Yue'er

191
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
You go back first

192
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Go

193
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Why are you unhappy?

194
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
You are so embarrassed

195
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
I asked you that day

196
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Who will go to Runan with Pei Yan to suppress the rebellion?

197
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,020
What did you write in my letter?

198
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
Zhou

199
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
No

200
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,020
No

201
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,020
You are just trying to trick me

202
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
I go to you and you say Zhou

203
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,020
He goes to you and you say Pei

204
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,020
You are questioning me again

205
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,020
If you can really predict the future

206
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,020
Why don't you tell me that Ziqin will have Pei Yan with him?

207
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,020
Why don't you tell me that His Majesty's body is already the end of the strong man?

208
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Why don't you tell me that the battle in Runan will almost kill me?

209
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,020
You are lying to me

210
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,020
I am capable of seeing the truth

211
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
But I want to go

212
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
It's fake

213
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
It's all fake

214
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
You are like a dog

215
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
You only know how to deceive people

216
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
I believe you can help me to calm down

217
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
I will kill Gu Zhao Zhao and you

218
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
How dare you lie to me?

219
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Madam

220
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,020
My future is in danger

221
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
Zhou Shila

222
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
Zhou Shila

223
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
Zhou Shila

224
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,020
Someone is telling you that you are a bribe

225
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,020
His Majesty has ordered to take you back to interrogate

226
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,020
What a dog is barking and running around

227
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Who is it?

228
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Who is the one who told me that?

229
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Doctor

230
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Who is it?

231
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Who is it?

232
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Who told me that?

233
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
Who told me that?

234
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Who is it?

235
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,020
Doctor

236
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Who is it?

237
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,020
Who is it?

238
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,020
How did you find out about Zhou Julan?

239
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
When he was kidnapped in the north and south

240
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
I helped him to check the accounts

241
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,020
and often went to the Zhou family

242
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,020
That's why I found out about it

243
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Then you just ignored it

244
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
Until he took the body back to the court

245
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,020
you used my name to report to His Majesty

246
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,020
His Majesty immediately sent someone to investigate

247
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,020
The evidence is indeed solid

248
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,020
When he was in the prime of his life

249
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
he was so happy

250
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,020
He was so happy

251
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,020
When he was in the prime of his life

252
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,020
he was so happy

253
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,020
I don't know what kind of gift you like

254
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
so I sent this to you

255
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
How is it? Do you like it?

256
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
I like it very much

257
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
Yunzhao

258
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,020
How did you learn to be so arrogant?

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,020
I learned it by myself

260
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
Sorry to bother you

261
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,020
But someone wants to see you, Yunzhao

262
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Who is it?

263
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
Xi Ke

264
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
What do you want?

265
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
You came to me

266
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,020
just to ask me this

267
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
I have been asking people everywhere

268
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,020
I want to ask someone to make an apology for Zhou Junlan

269
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
They said that the person who needed to cut his hair

270
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
should turn to the court

271
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
They only knew that the single man

272
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
was good at secretly meeting

273
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,020
So? Do you like it?

274
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
This hair

275
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Are you helping or not?

276
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,020
I am helping

277
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
You like it so much

278
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,020
What?

279
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Zhou Junlan

280
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
even wants to let go of his dignity

281
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Maybe

282
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Then are you willing to do everything for him?

283
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
Say it

284
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
What do you want?

285
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,020
I want your life

286
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,020
What should you call me?

287
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Should I call you Song Nanfei?

288
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Or should I call you Zhao Yan?

289
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Zhao Yan is dead

290
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Zhao Yan is dead

291
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Only Song Nanfei is in the world

292
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
You shouldn't do this

293
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
You shouldn't do this either

294
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
It's been a long time

295
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
You actually became the shadow of this bastard emperor

296
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Guards

297
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Yes

298
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Feed him for a few days

299
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
If he doesn't eat it

300
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
he will be alive

301
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Yes

302
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
Oh no

303
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,020
How can I leave?

304
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,020
I want to leave

305
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,020
I want to leave

306
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Oh no

307
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
Wait

308
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,020
I want to leave

309
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
Xiang

310
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
You are really Xiang

311
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
You are the son of Peiyuan

312
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
I am

313
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Peiyuan

314
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
We have been fighting for a long time

315
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,020
I don't want you to be in my hands again

316
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,020
I want to be in your son's hands again

317
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
What do you mean?

318
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
I just said why I couldn't find it all the time

319
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
It was on you

320
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,020
But my father has always been against you

321
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
How could he give it to you?

322
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
So

323
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
I am

324
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
I am

325
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
I am

326
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
I am

327
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I am

328
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
I am

329
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
I am

330
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
You betrayed my father

331
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
No

332
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Not you

333
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
If it was you

334
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Why did you tell me about it?

335
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
It wasn't me

336
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Who is it?

337
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
I am

338
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
I am

339
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
I am

340
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
I am

341
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I am

342
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
I am

343
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I am

344
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
I am
