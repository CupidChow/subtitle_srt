The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,720
Marquis Xuan Ying is accompanying the banquet.

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
Marquis Xuan Ying?

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,080
There's a woman who wants to marry him?

6
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,400
I don't think she's a pure-hearted person.

7
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
She's a perfect match for him.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,560
Marquis Xuan Ying,

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,680
I traveled a thousand miles

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,880
from the east of the dragon to the spring.

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,920
I came here to give you a key.

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,200
A dead man

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,880
walking towards a dying man.

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,920
What key?

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,680
A key that can unlock the lock of the Pavilion of Perishing.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,280
Marquis Xuan Ying is not a sinner.

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
He can come and go as he wishes.

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
Where can he find the lock?

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,760
He can't speak or see or see.

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
He can't see or see.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,320
What does he have to do with family?

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,960
You...

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,040
What's wrong with you, my lady?

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,160
You're talking so rudely.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeah.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,920
No matter how weak Marquis Xuan Ying is,

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,920
he's still a marquis.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,840
My lady,

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
Princess Qingyang is asking you to go there.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,600
The show today is not bad.

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
My lady, let's go.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,360
My lady,

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
you've found the wrong person.

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
After many years of hard work,

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,720
Marquis Xuan Ying has really become a real man.

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
I admire him.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,000
But the key is in my hand now.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't even dare to take a look?

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Pretending to be a ghost?

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,360
You...

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,200
Go!

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,960
If the contributions of others

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,960
and the fact

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
those men are sick

45
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
are all things to council.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
If the grandfather Gothen,

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,380
We'll be vitesseazarissimaring.

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,600
Your highness?

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Your highness...

50
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,900
Pei Yan.

51
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,600
Pei Yan.

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Open your eyes.

53
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,640
It's just sixpence.

54
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Yan.

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,100
If someone comes to know your weakness,

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,660
remain guard against it

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,380
if necessary.

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,100
Now,

59
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,740
you will have to face the consequences to know

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,560
Withdraw.

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
Who are you?

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,980
How did you hell her?

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,880
I have told you

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
that I am here to send you the betrothal?

65
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,760
My lord?

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:48,940
You've already got it, rundown father,

67
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,840
You just need to nutmeg her for now

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,640
No need

69
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,000
You are still a

70
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,980
sliver of an arrow

71
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,980
But he feels he wanted me to marry Jun Lan

72
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,900
and to make father and mother f actress me their daughter

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
to reject our다�ack

74
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,300
You two are already an eye-class

75
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,260
that seafood she used bake the prohibition

76
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,300
then why he blames you

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,540
rip the faith

78
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,420
Weim BIGV

79
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,700
Why should she blame you?

80
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,860
How about this?

81
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,900
I'll meet her tomorrow.

82
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,020
Princess Qingyang sent someone here

83
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,140
to invite you to the banquet tomorrow.

84
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,860
Go to the banquet at Zhou's Mansion?

85
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,780
Yes.

86
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,340
It's obviously that

87
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,660
the groom of the Zhou family is holding a banquet,

88
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,660
but Princess Qingyang invited you to go.

89
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
It's really strange.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,300
If that's the case,

91
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,140
I have to go.

92
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,660
The one who comes is not kind.

93
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,860
It's okay.

94
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,900
Pei Yan should be there too.

95
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,180
Did she recognize you as her fiancee?

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,660
You saw wrong,

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:07:01,560
an

98
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,400
immortal's wish is not a priority.

99
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,120
Where I can't encourages

100
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,160
my promise.

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,180
You will bewy

102
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,900
of my photos.

103
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,300
She recognized you.

104
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,820
It's so nice.

105
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,340
It's so beautiful.

106
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,420
Congratulations, Madam podong.

107
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,100
Madam Qiu, your dress is so Pat Blazing.

108
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
but don't mention the name of it.

109
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,660
What on earth are you going to do?

110
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,980
Zhao Zhao.

111
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm�� here to introduce the princess.

112
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Miaoshan.

113
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,240
Could you treat me well,

114
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,020
please?

115
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,060
You're here now?

116
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,060
Princess Qingyang invited you for a遭,

117
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,580
it's easy to surgical check.

118
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,220
Zhao Zhao.

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,580
Are you hating me

120
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
so you don't want to be my girlfriend?

121
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,220
I'll say it again.

122
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,940
I'm not Gu Zhao Zhao.

123
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,300
It's not fair.

124
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,700
Why should we believe you?

125
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,580
Let us believe you.

126
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,100
Why should we believe you?

127
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
It seems that

128
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,420
I don't need to prove it to anyone.

129
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,300
Even if you're the princess,

130
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,420
you have no right to...

131
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,340
Zhao Zhao.

132
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,780
Is it really you, Zhao Zhao?

133
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,580
Are you really alive?

134
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,100
If you're alive,

135
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,340
why didn't you come home?

136
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,980
You've got the wrong person.

137
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,980
No.

138
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
You're Zhao Zhao.

139
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,340
How could I not recognize you?

140
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,100
Since you left,

141
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,820
I've been thinking about you.

142
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,340
I've been thinking about you.

143
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,780
I've been thinking about you.

144
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,140
I've been thinking about you.

145
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,500
I've been thinking about you.

146
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,820
Since you left,

147
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,140
I've been having a bad dream.

148
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,700
Now that you're back,

149
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,100
why are you still hurting me?

150
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,740
Do you have any reason to do this?

151
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Madam.

152
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,940
Go back and have a rest.

153
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,420
Come on.

154
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Zhao Zhao.

155
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,020
Zhao Zhao.

156
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,940
Zhao Zhao wouldn't be so cruel to her parents.

157
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,860
It seems that I was too harsh.

158
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,500
My Lord, please.

159
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,300
Please take me to Uncle Jiang.

160
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,340
I'll leave after I say hello to him.

161
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,780
This way.

162
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,580
I'm willing to prove it.

163
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,780
Otherwise,

164
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,020
I'm afraid that I won't be safe in the capital.

165
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,220
In that case,

166
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,460
there's a baby in the middle of the road.

167
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,420
You mean

168
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,460
I should leave in public?

169
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,260
There are women here.

170
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,660
Why not?

171
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,580
Yes.

172
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,860
Why not?

173
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,540
You invited me to your house.

174
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,660
Is this the way to treat guests

175
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,780
who are the sons of the royal family?

176
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,780
Enough.

177
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,580
If you're not Gu Zhao Zhao,

178
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,180
I'll make up for it.

179
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:36,980
Okay.

180
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,780
If you're not,

181
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,020
please give me 100 taels of silver.

182
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,940
How about it?

183
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,540
100 taels?

184
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,260
100 taels?

185
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,140
Just 100 taels.

186
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,940
I'm fine.

187
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,420
You're willing to leave in public just for 100 taels?

188
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,260
What's the difference between you and a prostitute?

189
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,580
It's so wonderful.

190
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,420
You should talk to your aunties about it when you go back.

191
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,660
Stop dawdling.

192
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,980
Take off your clothes.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,780
Marquis Xuan Ying is not a good person.

194
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,460
Could it be that he knows her?

195
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,580
Marquis Xuan Ying,

196
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,580
what's your relationship with her?

197
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,380
Yes.

198
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,900
What's our relationship?

199
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,220
Lady Ji is mine.

200
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,260
Unmarried wife.

201
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,260
I'm not married.

202
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm not married.

203
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,540
I'm not married.

204
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
I'm not married.

205
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
I'm not married.

206
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,940
I'm not married.

207
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,580
I don't know.

208
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,980
You didn't say it earlier.

209
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,940
He promised to take off his clothes.

210
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,260
Yes, I did.

211
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,100
I, Ji Yun Zhao,

212
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,540
won't break my promise.

213
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,460
I'll keep my promise.

214
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,020
I'll keep my promise.

215
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,020
Then take me as your

216
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,300
ences.

217
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Has anyone else left?

218
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,380
No one is here?

219
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,780
Not here.

220
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,740
No one left.

221
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,740
couldn't touch my body at all.

222
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
You are

223
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,500
getting on my bad side.

224
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,180
This hundred taels of silver

225
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,780
I bought the herbs

226
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,820
in the name of Princess Qingyang

227
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,380
and gave to the poor.

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,560
Now, I'm here in the capital

229
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,420
to set up a medical centre

230
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,040
to help the common people

231
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,200
through its medicine brow.

232
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,580
No sooner than better than worse.

233
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,620
Your Highness and

234
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,800
all my wives please

235
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,660
help me prove

236
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,560
my gratitude to them.

237
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm sorry for your complaints.

238
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,900
You've solved the crisis and bought people's hearts.

239
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Sister Zhao has improved.

240
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,940
It seems that Mrs. Qiu is determined to recognize me as Gu Zhao Zhao.

241
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
What do you want to do?

242
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,300
But I don't care.

243
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,220
This game is boring.

244
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,300
Great.

245
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm very willing to be with you.

246
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,540
Gu Zhao Zhao is good.

247
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,340
Ji Yunzhao is good.

248
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,500
They're just characters in the book.

249
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,020
The whole family is living in fear.

250
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,620
Life and death are all in my hands.

251
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,220
I'm the one who has to face them.

252
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
They are all the same.

253
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,820
The sky is always clear.

254
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
The sky is always clear.

255
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,020
The sky is always clear.

256
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
When I'm with the sky, the world is bright.

257
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Who knows who will be the winner?

258
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,420
The past is the past.

259
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
The past is the past.

260
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,620
I'm the one who has to face them.

261
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,820
I'm the one who has to face them.
