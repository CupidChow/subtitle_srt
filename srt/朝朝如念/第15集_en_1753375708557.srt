Episode 18

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What do you want to investigate?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can investigate as I want.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But you must bring me along.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No reason.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Ji Xiao,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
isn't there in the imperial palace...

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Uncle!

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll take the bug and throw it out.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Who's on the list?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Zhao Yan?

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then who is it?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No one.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yunzhao,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you know when you lie,

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you always like to look into people's eyes.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Just like now.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're wrong.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Only those who are anxious

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
dare not look into other people's eyes.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are Ji Yunzhao.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are so calm,

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so you can act in a different way.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's why I'm so sure

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that you are hiding something from me.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll tell you when the time is right.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What is it?

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Like when people died in Suizhou in front of me.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Maybe.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is not fair.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You know everything about me,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but I don't know you well.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yunzhao,

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you can keep secrets from me,

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you can lie to me.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't force you to get rid of all the past.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I just want to know,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
do you have to get involved in this?

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then on the list,

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
there's my name.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it just a name?

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's Yin Jian.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Ceng Shi.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can't go.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Chang'an is the most critical place to get involved.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What about Zhao Yan?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's also on the list.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You forgot what you promised Zhao Meng.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If Zhao Yan goes to the dead end one day,

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you'll help him.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll help him.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can't go.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can't go.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can't go to the dead end.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You'll help him.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's also good to help him get through this.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yunzhao,

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I promise you,

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll do my best.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But you have to promise me,

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you won't get involved in this.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sorry,

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't do it.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where are you going?

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to find the boat.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I got it.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can leave.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is it really like what Xian said?

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's really innocent.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Impossible.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sir,

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ji Yunzhao from the Jishi Hall is here.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come in.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't come to the San Bao Hall.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What brings you here?

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm here to talk to you about a deal.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tea and wine are good for your health.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm glad to hear that.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sir,

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ji Yunzhao is not allowed to enter.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not allowed to enter.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm just doing my job.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just doing your job?

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He's a good man.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My mother can't listen to him.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Madam, you can't...

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Madam.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sister Qiu,

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you're from a noble family.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How can I treat you like a sister?

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm here to deliver soup.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get out.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I came first.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yue'er.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She just married you.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She's your daughter.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why do you treat her like this?

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Beauty makes soup.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're so lucky.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You said you can't drink.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't ask you to drink soup.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You didn't ask Jiang Yue to marry you.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I didn't ask you to meet Ji Yunzhao in private.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You didn't miss it.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're spying on me.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're mine.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I told them to take good care of me.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's wrong with that?

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Tell me.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What did he come to you for?

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's a good friend of mine.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's involved with the Gu family in the South and North case.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He wants to investigate with me.

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The Gu family?

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He clearly wants to tell you that he's Gu Zhao Zhao.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He doesn't even want a family.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You think he cares about the Gu family's life?

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He just wants to take the opportunity to see you.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's just trying to break my teeth.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He said he's not Gu Zhao Zhao.

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's just a little bit like Master Gu.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A little bit like him.

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What does he say? What do you believe?

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why don't you take him into the family?

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I believe you.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I obey you.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And now I tell you.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have no collusion with him.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you believe it?

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't believe it.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In your heart,

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
how I say, how I do, how I think is never important.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What's important is yourself.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You think I'll do whatever I want.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why?

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because I know my future.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But don't you have a time to lose your mind?

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's because you didn't do well enough.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't do well enough.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You've always been the one to decide.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you let me decide?

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If Jin Yunzhao can really help me get rid of that person,

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
what's the harm in cooperating with him?

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Drink.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't drink.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Drink.

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Fine.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're not obedient.

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll change it.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There are 51 people in total.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
One of the examiners.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
11 people of the investigation officer.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A total of 63 people.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Pei Yan wants to know if there's any collusion between them.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
At least 63 families have to be investigated.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then we'll just go to his house before him.

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And investigate the accounts.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's what I meant.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But I don't know where to start.

183
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Gu family?

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You don't have to worry about me.

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Pei Yan doesn't know that I have a marriage with the Gu family.

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
As far as I know,

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
he should investigate the accounts one by one.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Xu Ying has already investigated 3 or 4 households.

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's start from the 5th household.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
How about it?

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

192
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Come on.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The old man is a wolf-catching demon.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But my family's accounts have been confiscated by the Xuanying Marquis.

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We're just one step behind him.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We have to take two steps ahead.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Only then can we be one step faster.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What a coincidence.

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The Xuanying Marquis also asked me to take the accounts.

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So the Xuanying Marquis took the accounts...

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We've already messed up the order.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why would he take the first step?

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Someone can help him.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He can be a good man.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You mean...

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your wife.

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No need to make a fuss.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go to the Gu family.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They might be waiting for us.

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He's waiting for us?

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Maybe he thinks that I took his accounts and he wants mine.

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He's not good enough to be in the palm of my hand.

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He's still so arrogant.

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let me see him.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mr. Zhou.

218
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You have the ambition to be a red fox.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But you're trapped in this place.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't you want to find another way out?

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Find another way out?

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Life is like a fire in the morning.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How long can you live?

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Mr. Zhou.

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Please think twice.

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's go.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's go.

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It seems that he's more interested than I thought.

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mrs. Ji.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What a coincidence.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There are many bars in the capital.

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But I'm the one who chose to meet at my bar.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know if it's a coincidence

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
or some stupid thing

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that's deliberately attracting people's attention.

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Qiao Xian.

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Which stupid thing is the right thing to do?

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
As far as I know,

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
there are some people in the bar who are from the Gu family.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate to say that it's yours.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Gu family has no queen.

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm the only goddaughter that my aunt has.

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The current one is from the Gu family.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's still from the Gu family.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In the future,

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
it's not a good thing.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've been to the Gu family.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You two

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
don't have to go there anymore.

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mr. Fang,

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
pack up your luggage.

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't treat your guests well.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's go.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Where are we going?

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To the Gu family.

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But...

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't worry.

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll take care of everything.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mr. Zhou,

261
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Mrs. Ji,

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
please go back.

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The accounts of the Gu family

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
have been handed over to the Marquis of Xuanying.

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The Marquis of Xuanying has to make a decision.

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But as far as I know,

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the Gu family has been in business for generations.

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mr. Gu is always cautious.

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He always keeps a record.

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Even the accounts

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
have to be kept.

274
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How did you hear that?

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's just a rumor.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Did my son

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
tell Mr. Zhou?

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Mr. Zhou

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
told you?

280
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why did you say that?

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mrs. Ji made a marriage contract with someone else.

282
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How can she be separated from her husband?

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The Marquis of Xuanying is your fiancee.

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You should take good care of her.

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
How can you let her go?

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
She can't go with her husband.

287
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And Mr. Zhou,

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
it's inevitable for a couple to meet.

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You should be more tolerant.

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Give it to them.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't worry, Mrs. Ji.

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just check the accounts.

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm right.

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's a long story.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's suspicious.

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If they want to investigate,

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
just give it to them.

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Right.

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I was wrong.

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There were many problems.

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Please forgive me.

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mrs. Ji, please be serious.

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Mr. Zhou, please wait a moment.

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mrs. Ji,

305
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
please come with me.

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is it.

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have one more thing to ask you.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Please.

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You have done a good job.

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why do you still want to get the title?

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you know what this is?

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Feng Ling.

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I have a daughter.

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Her name is Zhao Zhao.

315
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She was naughty and naughty when she was a child.

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She was often punished by her mother.

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She was afraid of pain.

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She cried when she was hurt.

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I cried so much that I couldn't drink tea

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or check the accounts.

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I had to think of a way to make her happy.

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I couldn't check the accounts.

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I had to think of a way

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to get her all kinds of things back.

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Later I found out

326
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that she liked Feng Ling the most.

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
When she heard the sound of the bell,

328
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
she smiled.

329
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She smiled and forgot to move.

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She was in a daze.

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She ran away.

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know where she ran to.

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I wanted to find her.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But everyone said

335
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that she ran away.

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
On the night of the wedding,

337
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
she ran away with a man.

338
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
She lost the dignity of the Gu family and the Zhou family.

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why bother to find her?

340
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Zhou Shi Lang didn't want to find her.

341
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He didn't let me go either.

342
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How dare I not doubt her?

343
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I am ashamed to face the grudge.

344
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
In this case,

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Mr. Gu is just trying to prove himself because of Xu Nu.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If I am the one who is in charge of Tao Tian,

347
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I can protect her.

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I won't let her wander around

349
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and have no home.

350
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I will not let her go.

351
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I will not let her go.

352
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You are a good man.

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You are a good man.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You are a good man.

355
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You are a good man.

356
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You are a good man.

357
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You have been a doctor for many years.

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Have you ever seen a woman

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
who looks like you

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and is called Zhao Zhao?

361
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I have seen her.

362
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
She...

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
She is good.

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Many people have told me

365
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that I look like her.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But I have never seen her.

367
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know if she is doing well.

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's also the same.

369
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's the same.

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If one day we meet,

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
will you give me flowers?

372
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I will give them to her.

373
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Just say that

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I look like her

375
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
when I am with her mother.

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay.

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I will remember it.

378
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I will send this account book

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you.

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Goodbye.

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The End

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The End
