00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
The disaster in the south of Peiyan

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
caused the rice price to rise.

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
The people of Jin and the people of Lian

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,360
have been killed.

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,960
It's a pity

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,520
that you didn't

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,120
hold on to this kind of handle.

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,280
As long as you know it,

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
you can use it at any time.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,440
I don't care.

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,640
Don't let me down.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm a beauty.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Zhou Junlan.

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Who are you looking for?

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,240
Zhou Junlan, come out.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,720
Ji Yunzhao?

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
What are you doing?

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,080
Come up.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
Why?

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,440
I want to enter the palace without a token.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
But you can.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
What are you doing in the palace?

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm suing Yu Zhuang.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,840
You want me to sue Yu Zhuang for you?

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm not suing you.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm suing Yu Zhuang for you.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
That's right.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,800
You have no evidence.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,200
Who are you suing?

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,320
The corrupt officials are in a bad shape.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
The loyal officials die of hatred.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
The people are not rich.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,440
Is the winning and losing important

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,760
or the survival of the people important?

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Is your civilization important?

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Or is the justice of the throne important?

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Do you believe me?

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,320
No.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
Then why?

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,200
I just let go of a country.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,520
That's all.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
What are you betting on?

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
The way to save the people is right in front of me.

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,120
I bet you will be loyal and will follow the right path.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Give me your hand.

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Sit tight.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,080
What are you saying?

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Let's set a path for the world.

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,320
The Spanish Jose has set a Ne Shimada tussle against the British army,

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:34,140
which involves brothels and

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,780
have Spaniards,

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,340
specialists and

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,720
devils that began to work there.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,280
You said there's aores.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,920
I heard it andmented you.

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,960
Find the leader of the Northern Application School PolizeorFOX conducted this experiment.

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,360
You can send it to Marquis Xuanying in person.

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,400
The rest of the court affairs

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,160
will be handled by Minister Jiang for now.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,840
You may leave.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,280
When will you use it?

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,480
How?

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,560
Don't disappoint me.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
What else?

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,360
Nothing.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,920
I'll take my leave.

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Huh?

71
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Aren't you afraid?

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Close your eyes and listen.

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,860
Hope that I understand something.

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,980
I'll write it for you, then.

75
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,020
According to the order from the Duke of Tuansğu,

76
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,020
we've been walking in the city for three days.

77
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,780
The Mijia is coming to normal.

78
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
Listen!

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Yes!

80
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,660
Arrest Zhao Peng and his accomplices

81
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,060
and bring them back to the case.

82
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,140
Plough時尋的廣場

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,700
After I dreamt of Huang Liang

84
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,980
it was clear and quiet.

85
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,140
The situation has not been decided.

86
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,300
From what I know ...

87
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,340
It was so long ago ...

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
This ...

89
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
This is the gold medal you gave me?

90
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Disappointed?

91
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,460
Disappointed?

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
Disappointed?

93
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,460
After the selection, I married Ji Yunzhao.

94
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,660
He just arrived in Suizhou for a few days,

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,060
and then killed two people.

96
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,660
His Majesty ordered him to interrogate me.

97
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,060
I took the first step to take his life.

98
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,060
God bless me.

99
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,660
God bless me.

100
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,260
God has a command.

101
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,060
God's will.

102
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
No matter what kind of torture you go through,

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,660
before I speak,

104
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,060
you can't say a word about this.

105
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,060
Remember,

106
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,060
tomorrow, he will interrogate you.

107
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,260
If anything happens to Dongchang,

108
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,660
you can force him to interrogate his woman.

109
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,660
What a double-edged sword.

110
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,260
Since you have a great hatred for him,

111
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
you can also get rid of your hatred for the exchange of the pearl.

112
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,460
That's wonderful.

113
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
But...

114
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,460
Let go.

115
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,460
Marquis Xuanying is interrogating me now.

116
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,460
I have evidence in my hand.

117
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,460
I need to find a way to get rid of him.

118
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
I have a confession.

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,660
If Ji Yunzhao brings the pearl back,

120
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,060
he doesn't need to interrogate me.

121
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,060
He can be sentenced to death in the court.

122
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
It only takes five days to get to Suizhou.

123
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,060
If you don't tell me in five days,

124
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,260
I will be sent to the head-cutting stage in five days.

125
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,460
So when are you going to tell me?

126
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,660
You guess.

127
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,860
I guess?

128
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,460
Your mystery is too long.

129
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,060
I forgot it while listening.

130
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,660
Can you make it shorter?

131
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,460
I have a friend.

132
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,860
He is noble and has a dignified appearance.

133
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,660
But he likes a wanderer

134
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,060
who is always wandering.

135
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,660
How can he make the wanderer

136
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,460
feel happy for him?

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,460
May I ask you,

138
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
what is the condition of the wanderer?

139
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,460
Everything is fine.

140
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,660
But he likes to dress up as a girl.

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,660
The family conditions seem to have some end.

142
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,660
Dress up as a girl?

143
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,460
I think he doesn't like girls.

144
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,860
Nonsense.

145
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,660
It's the first time he sees me.

146
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,460
He is hugging me.

147
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,860
And he is touching my face with his hands.

148
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,660
That's even worse.

149
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,660
He is touching his hands and feet when he first meets.

150
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,460
He is a man of high quality.

151
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,460
But you said I...

152
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,460
My friend.

153
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,660
No need to explain.

154
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,460
I know.

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,460
You know?

156
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
He first teased your friend.

157
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,460
Then he teased you.

158
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,860
It's clear that he is a man of high quality.

159
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,860
Next time you see him,

160
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
you must give him a slap.

161
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,660
Then give him a punch.

162
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,060
Give him a punch.

163
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,660
Where are you going?

164
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,260
Pichai.

165
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,260
I have another thing to do.

166
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,660
What is it?

167
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,860
What's your name?

168
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,060
San Yue.

169
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,260
We have been on the road for three days.

170
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,460
We will arrive in Suizhou in one day.

171
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
It's getting late.

172
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
It's not a good time to go.

173
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,460
Let's rest here.

174
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,860
We will leave tomorrow.

175
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,660
I have something to tell you.

176
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,060
Go ahead.

177
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,260
You are a man of high quality.

178
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,660
Suizhou is in a state of boom.

179
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,260
Marquis Xuanying is not involved.

180
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,260
You have known about this, right?

181
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,860
Yes.

182
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,860
Then why don't you

183
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,260
take a look at His Majesty?

184
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
How do you know?

185
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,860
If His Majesty is dissatisfied with Marquis Xuanying,

186
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
he will not order you

187
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
to give the sword to him.

188
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
If Marquis Xuanying really doesn't care about it,

189
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,460
he will not have a wife like you.

190
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,060
I am just a fiancee.

191
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,060
There are many changes in life.

192
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,860
Maybe I will die

193
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,860
in the next moment.

194
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,260
You like it?

195
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,260
Yes.

196
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,860
Why are you so handsome?

197
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,060
He just happens to be a decided culture.

198
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,660
You can celebrate his birthday put on a plant here.

199
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,460
He will rest at the Resources Team,

200
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,060
and mainly perform at the head πα accord.

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
Tamam.

202
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
Dis continuously,

203
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,860
accompanied the election.

204
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
When he verifies the horse is returned,

205
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,540
this will be a good memory for him to recall.

206
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,760
I have been seeing several things.

207
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,860
Rights have been shamed and enemies blamed.

208
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,060
How dare they?

209
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,060
I will not forget my life.

210
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,060
How can I forget?

211
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,060
That year, I helped my father to go home to collect the body.

212
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
The body was buried in the coffin.

213
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Only the coffin that was prepared for King Wei

214
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
was empty.

215
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Who is that person?

216
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
He was cut into pieces

217
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
or

218
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,060
he was killed by a man?

219
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
Who is that person?

220
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
He was killed by a man.

221
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
He was killed by a man.

222
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
I still remember

223
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
that person had a habit.

224
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Whenever he made a mistake in the army

225
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
and got interrogated by my father,

226
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
he would always use his thumb

227
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
to resist his index finger

228
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
to ease his tension.

229
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
Just like you.

230
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
A person can change his name and surname,

231
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
change his appearance,

232
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,060
but the habit

233
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
will be with everyone

234
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
and it will be hard to wipe it out.

235
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,060
If you say so,

236
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
the people who have this habit

237
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
are all those traitors.

238
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
When I first saw you, I found

239
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
that your behavior

240
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
was different from others.

241
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,060
It was just a slight change.

242
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,060
My Lord, are you and the two doctors

243
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,060
fine?

244
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
The soldiers in the army

245
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:48,120
were wearing fake

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
It was just a case of Song Hongjie.

247
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
And

248
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
what happened that year.

249
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
You are just an official.

250
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
You are not good at memory and you are good at reason.

251
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I guess you must be thinking

252
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
that I am lucky, right?

253
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
The sky is too dark.

254
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I can't see clearly.

255
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Then how about we fight again?

256
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
No need.

257
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
You like to win?

258
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Then I will teach you.

259
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
The wife has a marriage agreement.

260
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
No need to think too much.

261
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Shoot the arrow.

262
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Shoot.

263
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Shoot again.

264
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Shoot.

265
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Then you win.

266
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Since you like it, why do you kill it?

267
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Why do I kill it?

268
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
The people like it because of its skin,

269
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
its flesh,

270
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,120
and its bones.

271
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Like it

272
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
because it is weak and vulnerable.

273
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Because it is powerful and capable.

274
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Because it can make you rich.

275
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Isn't that the same with you?

276
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Look.

277
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
This is the rabbit I bought from the market today.

278
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Isn't it cute?

279
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
It is so skinny.

280
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
You are fooled by it again.

281
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
I bought it not to eat it.

282
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
I am just to keep it.

283
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Keep it?

284
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Yes.

285
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
It is also one of the dowry I want to marry.

286
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
When we get married,

287
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I will bring it here.

288
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I also gave it a name.

289
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
It is called Little Monster.

290
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Because it likes to eat vegetables.

291
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
It is more than eating carrots.

292
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Is it steamed,

293
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
braised,

294
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
or fried?

295
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Now that it is dead,

296
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
why do you kill it?

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
If it is dead,

298
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
how can its remains be alive?

299
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Eat it.

300
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Rabbit legs are very smooth.

301
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
It has the most meat.

302
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Your eyebrows look like mine.

303
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
An old friend,

304
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
but different from the old one.

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Who?

306
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
You.

307
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
I am the one who is different from you.

308
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
I am the one who is different from you.

309
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Who?

310
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I forgot the name.

311
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
It is the pepper.

312
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Your skin is not good.

313
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
I picked out all the peppers.

314
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Why did you pick out all the peppers?

315
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
The pepper is not good for the skin.

316
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Why do you eat it?

317
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Just eat it.

318
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
I don't want to eat it.

319
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
You eat it yourself.

320
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Okay.

321
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
I will eat it.

322
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
I am sorry.

323
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I poured it and made it again for you.

324
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
I will eat it.

325
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
I will eat it.

326
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I will eat it.

327
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
The End
