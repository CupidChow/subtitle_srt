00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yue, you're awake.

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,400
What are you doing?

5
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,000
This is a trick that Doctor Qi Xiao taught me.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
There must be a mole in the fire.

7
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,280
But I've been looking for it for a long time.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,760
But I didn't find the suspect.

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,280
No need to look for it.

10
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
It's me.

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,200
How come you come here?

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
What did you do?

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I got it

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
Go

15
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
But she has no grudge with you.

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,400
Why?

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,720
I didn't mean to hurt her.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,840
I wanted to kill her.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,680
Three years ago,

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,880
many county magistrates in Suizhou

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
were defeated by the He Ba.

22
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,200
People were in a state of poverty.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
They were lost.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,440
The great cause of life is not to be delayed.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,920
His Majesty sent my father, Song Hongjian,

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
to help me.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
The He Ba is in a state of poverty.

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,200
People are in a state of poverty.

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,680
But he is a good man.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,080
He raised the price of rice

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,800
and kept the silk bag.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Prepare the horse.

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm going to the capital

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
to report to His Majesty.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,880
Father.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,640
Father.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,120
Father.

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Ru Yan.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,280
I can't go.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,560
Let's go.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Over there.

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,040
Let's go.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,240
Let's go.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Let's go.

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,040
Where is that boy?

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,760
Search.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,120
Father.

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,280
There's something here.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,840
It's a man.

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
Take him in.

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,600
He usually stays in the Eastern Courtyard.

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,160
I set fire to it that night.

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
Who knew

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,240
he actually put the Eastern Courtyard

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,920
to the shock of the imperial secret Power and

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,000
gs

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,040
Really.

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,400
A'yue.

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,840
Why are you acting so mercilessly?

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
I was killed by the Wu's

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,440
He asked me to kill him

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,160
Nonsense

63
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,240
My father is a good official

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,040
I planned to

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,840
kill him after the court official arrived

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
and then surrender to the imperial envoy

67
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,400
When I killed the imperial envoy

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,200
I was accused of this

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,720
for my father

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
Now the plan is out of control

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,560
I won't let him go

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,920
Lady Song Ru Yan

73
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm here to report to the imperial envoy

74
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,680
Lady Song Ru Yan

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm here to report to the imperial envoy

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,040
Lady Song Ru Yan

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm here to report to the imperial envoy

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm here

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
Tell me

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
What's the matter?

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,000
Song Hong Jian

82
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,840
The imperial envoy who died in Sui Zhou

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,320
I should have killed him

84
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,120
But his daughter...

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,520
I came to see you

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
How do you know?

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
I know nothing

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
I can do nothing

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,200
I've ordered someone to lock him up

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
I didn't expect that Marquis Xuan Yin and that doctor

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
would know about this

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Now they are in prison

93
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
listening to the sword

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Tell me

95
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,920
What should I do?

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,880
Write a letter

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,640
What letter?

98
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,760
The imperial envoy will be the head of the Mi family

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,360
He will be the head of the Wanhu

100
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
The letter will be sent to the palace

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
with 100,000 fire flags

102
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,000
If he is suspended from your position

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
how can he solve the case?

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,080
How can he interrogate you?

105
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,440
In this way

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,480
I can be at ease

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Where is Song Hong Jian's body?

108
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
You know everything

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't ask me for the second time

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,200
Do you know

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,640
your account book has been sent to my husband?

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
As long as I want

113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,360
I can make you

114
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
be happy forever

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,280
I will be your subordinate

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
You know you are a man of many things

117
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
but you still bury yourself under the tree

118
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,800
You'd better pray that you are lucky

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,840
Don't let them find out the evidence

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,560
If they know it

121
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
what should I do?

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,320
If they find the evidence

123
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,880
they will kill me

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,560
Open… open the coffin to examine the body?

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
What's wrong?

126
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,240
I am a doctor, not a coroner

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,240
What's the difference between a dead man and a living man?

128
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,880
Uncle, are you afraid?

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,320
Who says I'm afraid?

130
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
I just don't want to

131
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,360
It's a waste of money to dig the coffin in the ancestral tomb

132
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,160
Don't worry

133
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,960
The thunder struck the forest in the eastern suburb

134
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,200
and the tree roots were torn

135
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,400
and the coffin was taken out

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,200
Now the coffin has been taken to the county office

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,600
Where?

138
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Why didn't I see it?

139
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,400
What you are looking at is…

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,280
I'm going to be a beast

141
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,360
Please don't bother me

142
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,520
Hello, sir

143
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,860
Sorry

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
I hope you will…

145
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,320
Give me the knife

146
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm going to be a beast

147
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,540
I have an appointment with someone.

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,720
I have something to do

149
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,280
Can you buy it later

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
Hope that you agree

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,520
OK

152
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,160
The Kingdom to be favors with the manifactured

153
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,480
Recommend to send to powerful

154
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,640
był

155
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Your Lordship

156
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Where's the money?

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
The loan is half of your share

158
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Do you have any other orders?

159
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Not much

160
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
But

161
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
it should be enough

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
What's your name?

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Gou Pei

164
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Gou

165
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Gou Xiong

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
You're a businessman

167
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
You're a bit more generous

168
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I heard you're going to collect our rice

169
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
How much do you plan to pay?

170
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
20 million

171
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
20 million

172
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Ridiculous

173
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
20 million

174
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
It's not easy to sell rice

175
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
It costs 180 yuan a rice

176
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
20 yuan a rice

177
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Isn't it good?

178
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
It's a small profit

179
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
It's better than nothing

180
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Nothing?

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Now the people are fed up with you

182
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
How can they afford to buy rice?

183
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
If Suizhou continues to be like this

184
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Your Majesty will not ignore it

185
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
If we take out the rice

186
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
your rice will be more worthless

187
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
One thousand coins

188
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
If you don't buy it, I'll take it away

189
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Suizhou is hot

190
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
You've stored so much rice in the warehouse

191
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
You should be careful

192
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
If you get a fever

193
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
I forgot

194
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Your rice is everywhere now

195
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,360
It's piled up in that yard

196
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
800 coins

197
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
No

198
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
600 coins

199
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
The grain is expensive

200
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
You don't lack rice

201
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
But I lack money

202
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
You should be grateful for everything

203
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
600 coins

204
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Didn't you say don't take it away?

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
You just pressed the price

206
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
500 coins

207
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Why 500 coins?

208
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
You pressed the price

209
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Why are you so insincere?

210
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
You're right

211
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
How can you be so honest?

212
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I said it

213
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
How can you be so insincere?

214
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
I'll give you 300 coins

215
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I'll give you 300 coins

216
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Song Hongjian didn't commit suicide

217
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
He killed him

218
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
What are you going to do next?

219
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
The palace has a sword

220
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
to kill the king and the treacherous minister

221
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm going to get it

222
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
You're so kind

223
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Prepare the horse

224
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm going to report it to the prison

225
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I can't let anyone take the first step

226
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
You go to Wang's house to get the grain

227
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I'll send it out

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
But tomorrow?

229
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
What about the day after tomorrow?

230
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
If we continue to buy rice at this high price

231
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
I'm afraid the mansion...

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
No need

233
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,360
The rice will be sold in three days

234
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Isn't this your carriage?

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Mrs. Ji

236
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Where are you going?

237
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I found the evidence

238
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm going to the palace

239
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
OK

240
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Be careful on the road

241
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Stop

242
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Stop

243
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Don't run

244
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Don't move

245
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Don't move

246
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
No one is here

247
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Keep up the blood

248
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Go to the hospital in the city

249
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
There are women with wounds

250
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Come to the hospital

251
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Yes

252
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Who are you?

253
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
You know this is the princess's mansion

254
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
May I ask

255
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Is there a maid

256
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
who is favored by the princess?

257
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Please

258
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
save me

259
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Go, go, go

260
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Who is at the door?

261
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Such a big noise

262
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
There was a suspicious person

263
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
who was injured at the door

264
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
He said he would save her

265
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
by the maid you favored

266
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
But he didn't say anything

267
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
He said he was afraid of being hurt

268
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
The maid favored by the princess

269
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
went to save her

270
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Who are you?

271
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
You are Ji Xiao

272
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
You

273
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Why are you wearing

274
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
a woman's clothes?

275
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I

276
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
like to wear a woman's clothes

277
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Is it OK?

278
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
It's so strange

279
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
But

280
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I can do it

281
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Then

282
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
why are you wearing

283
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
the princess's clothes?

284
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
I like to wear

285
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
the princess's clothes

286
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Is it OK?

287
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It's so strange

288
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
But

289
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
it's beautiful

290
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Help

291
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Help

292
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
I'll go to call the master

293
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
There is no master in the mansion

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
What should I do?

295
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
What should I do?

296
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Help me to help her

297
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
No, no

298
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
My girl's image

299
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
can't be erased

300
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
What should I do?

301
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Lan Fu

302
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Go

303
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360

304

Come on, Lan Fu

332
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
