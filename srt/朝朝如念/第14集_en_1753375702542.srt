00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Ask him what he thinks.

4
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
What does he think?

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
Find someone with the account book.

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
He told you to find a way.

7
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Don't bother him.

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
He didn't say that.

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,480
I've been patient for a long time.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,840
We're sitting together.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,440
Do you want me to say something?

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
You've been back for so long.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,520
Why are you still angry?

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,320
Come to the party later.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,120
You and Qian An will be punished.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,220
It's the day we celebrate

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,800
the Forever Experience Festival.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,400
Now the time comes.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,300
His father brought you here on that occasion.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,840
Uncle after

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,300
Being pregnant by a rider

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,960
would make the servant

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,640
Classいや

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,860
Karen

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm not the one she should thank.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,880
She pities his hiddenbility

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,700
Are you satisfied with that?

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Yes.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Count Chenggui

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
This is a long story

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,020
That day in the day

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,180
the bird said

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,180
The key point

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,300
She fell in love with a girl

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,020
She wanted to ask if...

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,600
It's time

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
time to go out

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
You don't get it that easily

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Uncle

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,120
Uncle

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
How nice

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
So fancy

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,480
But...

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,880
You called me an ass.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,320
I don't have your ring between hands.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
I burn the way you use it.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,080
Mengyaoilantou,

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,680
go to the undoubtedly

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
himself.

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,040
If the war includes him,

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
he won't be the Emperor Guoan.

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,040
And,

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,760
if he doesn't kill Wen Zhu,

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
you can wait to meet him there.

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Miss,

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,120
what's going on?

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,080
It seems the murder in this place

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
appreciate you

59
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,360
I beat on you

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,880
Look

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
You may be beaten

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,320
If it's unurmacioun

63
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
I will come to my lady

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,640
Thanks for your concern

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
I am just thinking

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,180
how many lands people want to plant

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,840
so that they can Caseac a turn

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
Go into Qiaoliorim

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,840
to avoid stock and stock

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,040
Xuan Ying ho

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Minister

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,560
Minister Jiang is right

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm not the only one who has suffered

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,160
I owe it to my two friends

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
You look familiar

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm Ji Yunzhao, a doctor at the Jishi Hospital

77
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,160
I came to your house last time

78
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
to deliver medicine to you

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Yes, she is my...

80
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Minister Jiang, Marquis Ying

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
the banquet is about to begin

82
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Please

83
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Please

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Come, sit down

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Please

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Please

87
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Why don't you let me say it?

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Say what?

89
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Say you are my wife

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Why don't you say you are my husband?

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Okay, next time

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Say what?

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Say

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm your husband

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Okay, it sounds familiar

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Good

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Everyone

98
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
my father is sick

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
He asked me to come and reward him

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Marquis Xuanying

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Yes, Your Majesty

102
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
I'm sorry for your loss

103
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
I'll return your token to you

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
and reward you with 100 taels of gold

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
and 80 pieces of silk

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
You're all kind

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I'll be grateful if you don't ask for my permission

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm leaving

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Thank you, Your Majesty

110
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
He's so young

111
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
He's so young

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
He's so young

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
He's so young

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
He's so young

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
What's wrong?

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
He can join the court after he gets the token

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
His Majesty is afraid that I'm too powerful

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Minister Jiang is kind to Pei Yan

119
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
They want to help Pei Yan

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
and cure him

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
What do you want to do?

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
In order to prevent Pei family from joining hands

123
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I've come up with a plan

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Now you know how to do it

125
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Please

126
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Tell me

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
You told me

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
the clinic needs to repair the fan

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
You'll pay for the money His Majesty gave you

130
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
It's not necessary to buy the clinic

131
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
I'll take it

132
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
But you're so kind

133
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
I'll accept it

134
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,160
But I don't like to owe people

135
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
I'll just give it to you

136
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
What are you going to do?

137
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
I won't give you the money

138
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I'll give you the money

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Besides the money for the clinic

140
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
I'm going to send a batch of new medicine for the sale

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
If you still have the silver fish, I'll give it to you

142
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,160
It's three li per year

143
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Or you can just...

144
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
What's wrong?

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
I just think it's strange

146
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,160
I think it's strange

147
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
He said he's the maid

148
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I didn't see his figure all night

149
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Is there a lady named Sanyue in your mansion?

150
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Don't be so hasty

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Maybe she's the maid of the princess

152
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I think the princess is too arrogant

153
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
She hasn't come here yet

154
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
It's her birthday

155
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Why does she take so long?

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Princess Qingyang is here

157
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Why is she here?

158
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Aunt, what's wrong?

159
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm a little cold

160
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I'll go get some clothes

161
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
I'll go get clothes

162
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I'll go get clothes

163
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I'll go get clothes

164
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
I'll go get clothes

165
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,160
How do you know I'm here?

166
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,440
Why didn't I see you?

167
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm Princess Qingyang's maid.

168
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,480
I was helping her find clothes.

169
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,080
Princess Qingyang looks like you.

170
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,920
But she's not as good as you.

171
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
She's not good at treating people.

172
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
But you're good.

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Nonsense.

174
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,320
Princess Qingyang is good.

175
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,760
She's the best girl in the world.

176
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,200
Where is she good?

177
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,880
She's good in...

178
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,400
Well...

179
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,400
She...

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,960
Well.

181
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,600
No, just keep quiet.

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,040
I want to tell you something.

183
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,000
I...

184
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,640
Princess Qingyang must have something to take away.

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
Just let me think.

186
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,760
She...

187
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,640
She's so great.

188
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Help!

189
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm drowning!

190
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,160
Somebody help!

191
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080
Save me, please!

192
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,400
Save me!

193
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Dad.

194
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,680
Move aside.

195
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Yu'er.

196
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,880
Yu'er, what happened?

197
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
Why did you fall into the water?

198
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
I was enjoying the moon in the lake.

199
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,280
The people were so brave.

200
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,520
I don't know who sent me into the water

201
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,280
and saved me.

202
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,280
Although you are a good person,

203
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,200
you are not a good man.

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,320
You ruined your reputation.

205
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,800
What should we do?

206
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,000
They've been in the news before.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Now...

208
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,000
Which family dares to marry her?

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,280
Shut up!

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,680
You don't need to worry about me.

211
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
I'll ask His Majesty

212
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,000
to marry her for Yu'er and Mr. Zhou.

213
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't expect Mr. Zhou

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
to risk his life to save me.

215
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
I don't know if Mr. Zhou can...

216
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I'm willing to.

217
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Really?

218
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Really.

219
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,840
You are the one who let him do that.

220
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
Mr. Zhou,

221
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,520
stop Establishing an issue while you are alive.

222
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm histori Albania

223
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,620
and I've watched you for over 10 years.

224
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
Now, when she came to visit,

225
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
you grabbed her hand.

226
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,880
So I thought

227
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,800
you should be netted down.

228
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,080
I agree,

229
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
I said you should push Princess Qingyang to fall into the water

230
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,320
and marry her.

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,840
After all, she has the late emperor's will in her hand.

232
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
I don't know what it says on the edict.

233
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
But it's better than Jiang Yue.

234
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,200
What?

235
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
You made the decision to make Jiang Yue fall into the water.

236
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
You planned to marry her into the Zhou family.

237
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,560
I haven't got angry yet.

238
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
How dare you show me your face?

239
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,640
I'll talk to you later.

240
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,280
What's wrong with you?

241
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,360
What's wrong with me?

242
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
I want to ask you what's wrong with me.

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,840
I finally got married to Jiang's family.

244
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,600
I won more than Pei Yan and his family.

245
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
You don't have to thank me.

246
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,280
You're still so cold to me.

247
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
You promised me.

248
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,920
You won't take the chance.

249
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,840
If it weren't for Pei Yan's generousness,

250
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
how could I do this?

251
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
Now I'm in the upper hand.

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
You're coming to me for a new start.

253
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,080
You think I'm living a peaceful life?

254
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm helping you deal with Pei Yan.

255
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Really?

256
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
Sometimes I really want to know

257
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
whether you're helping me deal with Pei Yan

258
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,080
or me.

259
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,720
You said you'd give Ji Yun a good name.

260
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,080
You're the one who's always been so kind and nice.

261
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
Are you heartless

262
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,880
or just being loyal?

263
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm not.

264
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm just a little bit.

265
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
I'm just a little bit.

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm just a little bit.

267
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm just a little bit.

268
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm just a little bit.

269
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm just a little bit.

270
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm just a little bit.

271
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm just a little bit.

272
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm just a little bit.

273
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
I'm just a little bit.

274
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,880
I'm just a little bit.

275
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm just a little bit.

276
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
I'm just a little bit.

277
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm just a little bit.

278
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,480
I'm just a little bit.

279
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm just a little bit.

280
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm just a little bit.

281
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm just a little bit.

282
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,080
I'm just a little bit.

283
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm just a little bit.

284
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm lost.

285
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Episode 15

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
That's weird.

287
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
There are 51 scholars on the internet.

288
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Why are they all from the South?

289
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,440
It's because our South is smart.

290
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
That's not true.

291
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
The main examiner of the city is also from the South.

292
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
It's because your South is just like the French.

293
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
And they are fair.

294
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Damn it!

295
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
How dare you say that?

296
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Stop hitting him!

297
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Calm down!

298
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Stop hitting him!

299
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Why don't you say anything?

300
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
So humiliating.

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Let's go!

302
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Let's go to Gao Yuzhuang!

303
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Yes!

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Let's go!

305
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Let's go!

306
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
How dare you!

307
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Calm down, Your Majesty.

308
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
This is a misunderstanding.

309
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
More than 300 Northern princes

310
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
were stopped on the way to the palace

311
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
and were forced to

312
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
investigate this matter.

313
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
But what did you show me?

314
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
I ordered the scholars to study it.

315
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
11 of the Jiaxu Academy leaders

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
investigated this matter thoroughly.

317
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
They did not rest

318
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
and examined almost a thousand papers.

319
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
There was nothing wrong with it.

320
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
I told you to investigate it.

321
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
But you found that

322
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
a Northern prince had bad manners.

323
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
You are indeed inferior to the South's prince.

324
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
I dare not say that.

325
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I just want to talk about the matter.

326
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
At this meeting,

327
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
the Northern prince did make a mistake.

328
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Enough!

329
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
You may leave.

330
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Let Marquis Xuanying come in.

331
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Your Majesty.

332
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
In this meeting,

333
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
51 scholars were selected.

334
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
And 11 scholars

335
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
that were transferred by the minister of state

336
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
to investigate the case

337
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
were investigated thoroughly.

338
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
I respect that.

339
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Have you ever

340
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
disobeyed the imperial examiner?

341
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
I have.

342
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
I have.

343
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
I have.

344
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Have you ever disobeyed the imperial examiner?

345
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
I have not.

346
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
I ask you again.

347
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Have you ever disobeyed the imperial examiner?

348
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Speak!

349
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Dead?

350
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Father!

351
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Father!
