00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're awake.

4
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,000
I didn't expect us to survive.

5
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Thanks to the Marquis of Xuan Yin

6
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
who let us hide

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,600
in the big stone by the roadside

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
and get out of the mud and stones,

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
we survived.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,600
But in this world,

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,800
from now on,

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,800
there will be no you and me.

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
In this way,

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Sir,

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,400
thanks to your help,

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
I have to say goodbye again.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,000
Marquis of Xuan Yin,

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,600
didn't you ask us to go to the Apothecary Valley together?

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Where are you going?

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm going to the Western Liang.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
The Western Liang is the border of our country.

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
There are frequent wars there.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
The situation is unstable.

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
Why are you going there?

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I want to send troops.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
I've never done anything bad in my life.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Why did I end up like this?

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I want to send troops.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I want revenge.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
I want to make those who deserve to die

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,200
pay with blood.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Where are you going?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
To pick up someone.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Of course I know.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,200
But which one are you going to pick up?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You guess.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
You called me here

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
to accompany you to listen to the rain.

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
Listen to the rain, boil tea, and smell the fragrance.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How nice it is.

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
I like rainy days the most.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't like it.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Why?

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If the rain doesn't stop,

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
the flood will start.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
The silver and cold will be absorbed.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
People will get to know each other.

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
I just saw you not happy all day.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
I want you to be more relaxed.

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm not happy.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm not happy.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm not happy.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not happy.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm not happy.

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
I want you to be more relaxed.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
You were born in the imperial jade palace.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
You don't know the world.

58
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't you feel ashamed?

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Don't go.

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,800
I don't like rainy days the most.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Chuchuang.

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
I will accompany you

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
in the past

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:49,400
when we can't keep going.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,720
Lady Xi.

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
What can I do for you?

68
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,360
You...

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,440
You like rainy weather?

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,680
Of course.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,560
It's a good time to enjoy the rain.

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,240
I know a tea house

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
that can be used for the fragrance of the rain.

74
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,880
You can...

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,560
No need.

76
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,480
I'm soujins Teng Tauchou

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:47,780
in this

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
set from Huang E fast.

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
The swallow on the rafting is gone.

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
It's cold here.

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
They flew to the south to spend the winter.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
When will they come back?

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
At the end of the month, in the spring.

84
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
When will my husband come back?

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I dare not speak out.

86
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Is the soup in the kitchen ready?

87
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Yes.

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I'll go and get it.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I'll go and get it.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I'll go and get it.

91
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Go and check on it.

92
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Yes.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Husband.

94
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Husband.

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
I thought you weren't coming.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Do you like rainy days?

97
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
I don't like it.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Say you like it.

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
But I don't...

100
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Hurry.

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I like it.

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
What a big fire.

103
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Your men saw that Ji Yunzhao and Pei Yan were not compatible.

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,040
It was just a show between them.

105
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
If Ji Yunzhao knew that Pei Yan would take over the hot water mountain area of the south-north coast,

106
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
he wouldn't be able to help her.

107
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
So he used the help of Gu's men to come to you.

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,040
He made me cut the fire and Pei Yan calculated the fire.

109
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Now Pei Yan is so shameless.

110
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
It's all thanks to you.

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Yun'er, you go out first.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Hurry.

113
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
What kind of man is a woman?

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
You blame yourself.

115
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,880
You are not good enough!

116
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Not good enough.

117
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Not good enough.

118
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
You are still not good enough.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Not good enough...

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Why you are so bad?

121
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Not good enough.

122
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
Pei Ye, you're no match for him!

123
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,160
Not good enough.

124
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Not good enough.

125
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,360
Tell me.

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,720
Tell me.

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,520
What's good?

128
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,840
Don't touch me.

129
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,040
You're hurt.

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm hurt.

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm bleeding.

132
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,880
It's my fault.

133
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,520
It's all my fault.

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,440
I didn't do well enough.

135
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm no match for Pei Ye.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
If that's all you want to say,

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,040
get lost!

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,560
I've found it.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
No more hair Opti.

140
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,240
It's over.

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
From now on,

142
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll definitely help you

143
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
defeat him.

144
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,840
mushrooms

145
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Because of thousands of tudo,

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,880
which I love you,

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,500
I was lucky to meet you

148
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,520
Ten thousand Carbon

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,940
I'll

150
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
I've been jealous of you.

151
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,820
The whirlwind of love has made me dizzy.

152
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,100
I want to tell you that I trust you.

153
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,060
The fingers I clenched,

154
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,500
the sweat on my forehead,

155
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,860
the glaring of Doshan,

156
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,460
they're all saying that

157
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,820
I trust you.

158
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,700
Does it hurt?

159
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,420
No.

160
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,700
Then...

161
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,900
Can you get out?

162
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,900
Me?

163
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,780
Yes.

164
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,980
I don't believe it.

165
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,780
Get out.

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,940
Stop being so nosy.

167
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,060
What do you know?

168
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,580
Uncle Chi.

169
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,660
I remember that you have something to do today.

170
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,260
Yes.

171
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,540
I'll go out now.

172
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,220
Be careful.

173
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,580
Don't worry. I'm here.

174
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,540
Have a good trip.

175
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,380
What did Qiu Xian say to you?

176
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,980
He turned his head and said,

177
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,980
everything that happened in my life

178
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,580
was because of him.

179
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,500
Life...

180
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,940
is in your hands.

181
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,780
It's not for others.

182
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,060
Can I ask you another question?

183
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,660
You said you didn't want to answer.

184
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,060
I'm Gu Zhao Zhao.

185
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,380
After all, I'm a woman.

186
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,260
I'm a woman.

187
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,860
But

188
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,100
I know you have some feelings for me.

189
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,540
If you want to revenge,

190
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,780
I'll be your knife.

191
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,260
But there's no knife that's not afraid of blood.

192
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,140
Your acupoint treatment works well.

193
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,260
I'm not afraid of blood anymore.

194
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,440
Are you ready to thunderstorm the],

195
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,240
wait in the cold?

196
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,420
Now,

197
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,660
there's still a knife.

198
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,660
I've been waiting for a long time

199
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,460
How long?

200
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,180
Since you want to take revenge

201
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,900
I'll be your sword

202
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,780
Tell me

203
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,980
What's the matter?

204
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,540
As you said, my lord

205
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,860
I've finished the translation of Zhao Peng's account book

206
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,340
I'll write down the name of the soldier

207
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,380
The list is here

208
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,260
b comprend on mental

209
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,300
Feelings

210
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,900
I'm the deep- embrace

211
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,540
Guitar

212
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,820
Abundance

213
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,380
Upon your intention

214
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,540
Em airliner

215
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,900
Yes

216
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,560
Does the Directness Mile

217
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,100
take place every day?

218
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,780
Yes

219
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,620
No

220
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,660
There's this

221
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,900
and settled the rules of the Ministry of Revenue

222
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
with the Hu people

223
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,860
Unexpectedly, they broke the contract

224
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,940
and came back

225
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,900
This is a disgrace

226
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,500
The Hu people led three thousand cavalrymen

227
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,460
to surround the six thousand people

228
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,820
of the Western Liang Mountain Gate

229
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,100
to cut off 45,000 acres of land

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,940
to exchange for hostages

231
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,020
The first group of hostages will be the latter

232
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,060
I am willing to lead five thousand cavalrymen

233
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,180
to the mountain gate

234
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,900
to drive the Hu people out of the Western Liang

235
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,580
Mr. Zhou, what do you think?

236
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,460
I am deeply impressed by your concern for the country and the people

237
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
But

238
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,340
it's not too late to cut off 5,000 cavalrymen

239
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,180
and cut off 6,000 people

240
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,140
Is it not too late?

241
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,180
Your doubt is reasonable

242
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,780
Madam

243
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Madam

244
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,260
Mr. Gu

245
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
Madam

246
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,820
Mr. Gu

247
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Madam

248
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,780
I heard that you died in that mountain collapse

249
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,540
I wanted to follow you

250
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,620
But my master came to visit me in time

251
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,220
and told me about your secret place

252
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,020
and brought me here

253
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,180
In the family...

254
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,660
According to my master

255
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,020
all the servants were dismissed

256
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,940
I said I would go out for a walk when others asked

257
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,140
That's good

258
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,860
Young master

259
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,260
Thank you

260
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,700
Please

261
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,420
It's not my own contribution

262
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,740
You don't have to thank me

263
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,060
Have you checked the store?

264
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,300
According to your message, the night is sold out

265
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,540
The money is in the bag

266
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,460
Young master

267
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,300
What can I do for you?

268
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,540
I heard that the Gu Ming is famous

269
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,940
But no one knows where it is

270
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,020
Now we are here

271
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,980
and my daughter is in the capital

272
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,780
I can't trust her

273
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,820
I wonder if you can help me

274
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,460
and tell her where we are

275
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,620
Qiuxian is your goddaughter

276
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,180
Who is the daughter of the daughter of the water?

277
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm confused

278
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,060
I thought she was with me since I left

279
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,140
Young master

280
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,660
I'll give you the money as a thank-you gift

281
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,420
Who?

282
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,980
She will come back later

283
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,140
Don't worry

284
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,460
I'll send her back

285
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,340
Thank you

286
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,660
Take care

287
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,340
It's locked

288
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,260
You're up at night?

289
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,500
You have ruleress

290
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,700
within half an hour

291
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,300
to find the medicine for Iron God.

292
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,700
Sometimes, I dreamt

293
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,740
about the future.

294
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,060
But recently, I can't tell

295
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,100
which one is the dream

296
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,220
and which one is the future.
