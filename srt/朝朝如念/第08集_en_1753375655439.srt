00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,640
My Lord.

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,520
Let me go.

5
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,280
Yunzhao.

6
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm here.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,720
It's lit.

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
What time is it?

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,440
It's five o'clock.

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,320
You've been sleeping for an hour.

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
Someone promised me

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,800
to wake me up

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
after the incense is lit.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
I didn't break my promise.

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,720
I'll wake you up.

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
But you slept so well.

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
In your dream,

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,880
you even looked like him.

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,920
You even looked like me.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
You shouted,

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,240
get out.

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,520
It's lucky that Marquis Xuanying doesn't like killing people in his dream.

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
Otherwise, Yunzhao and I

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
will be left in Suizhou.

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,720
I was wrong.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,360
Thanks to him.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Long Ballad

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,280
Wake up.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,400
Wake up.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Wake up.

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,320
Don't sleep.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,120
Come with me.

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,080
My Lord.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,960
My Lord.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,320
You two doctors.

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,760
Are you okay?

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,720
The house was on fire last night.

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,320
I'm here to apologize.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,160
Why don't

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
we talk about the official matter first?

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,080
There are many people in the house.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,240
I wonder what kind of official matter Marquis wants.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
Let's talk about the fire last night.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
Suizhou was flooded for days.

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,720
The house was on fire.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,880
But on the day I got off the horse,

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,120
the fire started.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,640
This is not a natural disaster.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
It's...

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
It's a human disaster.

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,280
Yes.

54
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,400
The gate of the county office is open at night.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
There are people who work night and day.

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,400
Anyone who enters and exits the house must report to the north.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,880
And the fire is a bad thing.

58
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,800
Did anyone enter and exit the county office last night?

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,520
No.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
It's five o'clock in the afternoon.

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,560
The gate of the county office is not open yet.

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,440
No one entered and left the house last night.

63
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,680
The person who set the fire was in the house.

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,320
I asked someone to search the house carefully.

65
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
No outsiders were in the house.

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
That means

67
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,400
there is a mole here.

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,120
Here you are.

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,080
Thank you.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,080
Be careful.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,240
Thank you.

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,240
Here you are.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,000
Here you are.

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Thank you.

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,440
What's wrong?

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,760
A woman fainted in my seat.

77
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll get her some porridge.

78
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,080
The disaster relief food from the court

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,920
is enough to support the people of Suizhou.

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,920
At least half a month's food.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
Why is there still someone else?

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,600
You bitch, have some porridge.

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,320
You've had three bowls.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
These lowlifes are so arrogant.

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,440
They even want to steal someone else's porridge.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
The county office has warned us

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
that we can only give them one bowl a day.

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
But

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,760
they only give one bowl of porridge.

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
They want to steal someone else's porridge.

91
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,920
The Magistrate Zhao is kind.

92
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,920
But he's not good at it.

93
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,440
He's just a murderer.

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,880
Who's there?

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,360
Come out!

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll do it.

97
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,360
Trust me.

98
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,480
Is it you?

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,600
It's me.

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,440
There's poison on your watch.

101
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
It's so fast.

102
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
You'd better not act rashly.

103
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,320
Why should I trust you?

104
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
Do you think

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,480
you're starting to feel pain?

106
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,400
Can you save me?

108
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
You'll feel pain

109
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,160
if you move after you're full.

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Just take a nap.

111
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,560
How dare you fool me?

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,080
If you dare to do anything again,

113
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
I won't dare to guarantee

114
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,880
that you'll have a life of porridge in the future.

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Just wait and see.

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,560
His porridge.

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Here you are.

118
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,080
I thought he's a nice person.

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,680
Unexpectedly.

120
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,620
She traveled a ride here in the summer.

121
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,180
She looks as libid as that dam king.

122
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Why is she...

123
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,300
Well.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,240
My Lord.

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,280
What are you...

126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,220
I was in such a stockade.

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,940
2,12,11,14,15

128
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
You are girdly and miserable

129
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,560
What?

130
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,000
You are

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,360
I am Chiukabe

132
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,140
Doctor of Jishi medical school

133
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,140
J mü Champion

134
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,860
Do you have anything uncomfortable?

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,020
I'll karma medicine

136
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
You don't have to

137
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
No need

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,720
The controls.

139
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,640
You see,

140
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,400
you...

141
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:08,080
You have been

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,440
so dresses.

143
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,140
Compared to you,

144
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,440
Brother Yue inner power is just great.

145
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,240
All that remained

146
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
is to pay you back.

147
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
Long time no see.

148
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,640
Wake up.

149
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,920
I saw him.

150
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,680
My stomach...

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,680
My stomach hurts.

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,120
What are you talking about?

153
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,400
You didn't sleep at midnight.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,600
It's him.

155
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
He's back.

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,680
He's back.

157
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,880
Thanks to the doctor's daughter,

158
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,520
she went to the porridge.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,280
Those rich people

160
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
thought it was a big trouble,

161
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
so they left.

162
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
Those who couldn't get the porridge before

163
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
could drink it instead.

164
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm tired.

165
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
You can leave.

166
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,240
And that fire-fighting man.

167
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
I've found a way to test him.

168
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,720
It's called

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,680
the spirit snake test.

170
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,320
As long as

171
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,720
we get a jar.

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,760
Lian Er.

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
I'm tired.

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,320
You can leave.

175
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Okay.

176
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,280
Without me there would be no main road.

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,920
Can't you see

178
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm in such a hurry?

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,160
Not only are you there to fire and run around.

180
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,720
and extremely virtuous.

181
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,520
Who is she?

182
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Of course, she is...

183
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,600
The beautiful woman.

184
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,200
Come here.

185
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,880
The lady of Chunhua, Liu Su, is 27 liang.

186
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
The man outside Wang Yuan is 53 liang.

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,480
The Magistrate Zhao is truly a treasure hunter.

188
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,040
He is on the lookout for 13 times a month.

189
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
No wonder he is so virtuous.

190
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,760
Give me the account book.

191
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,520
You can echo it,

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
so I asked Ling Lang to come in

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,680
and listen to his father's Yin-Yang book.

194
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,720
Who are you?

195
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,720
Why are you here?

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,360
Have you forget all these

197
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
that you forgot me?

198
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
How do you know these things?

199
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
You guess.

200
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,960
I remember it.

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,720
I've seen you.

202
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,920
You're the wife of Zhou Shilang.

203
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,080
You...

204
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
I...

205
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,320
am a god.

206
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
Ridiculous.

207
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
How can there be a god in this world?

208
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Her hopes are written in this seal.

209
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
If there is no god,

210
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,600
then you steamed up problem

211
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
How did you know about these things?

212
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I know nothing.

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I can do nothing.

214
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Then tell me.

215
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
What should I do?

216
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Why don't you just remember the past?

217
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
The sand in his belly has been all over the place.

220
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Don't do it again.

221
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Thank you.

222
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Thank you, doctor.

223
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Thank you, doctor.

224
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Come.

225
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Be careful.

226
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Help...

227
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Help me.

228
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Don't panic, aunt.

229
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Tell me about your illness.

230
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I was only able to protect myself.

231
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Now I can't sleep at night.

232
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
I can't bear the pain.

233
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
You're suffering from depression.

234
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
You need to take the medicine to calm your nerves.

235
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
I had no choice.

237
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Firewood,

238
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
ginseng,

239
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
and gold.

240
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
You've given birth to me, haven't you?

241
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
That's why you poisoned the porridge.

242
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm in pain.

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I'm here to find you.

244
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm here.

245
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Are you unwell?

246
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Aren't you ill?

247
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I'll go get you some food.

248
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Enjoy yourself.

249
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Come closer to me.

250
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Have some mint tea.

251
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Supriggines.

252
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Drink some sugar.

253
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,680
It's ok

254
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,200
Thank you doctor

255
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,120
Wait

256
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,600
You need to take medicine for injury

257
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,160
This medicine should not be taken

258
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,920
Or you will also die

259
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,640
Any more

260
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,880
You can't cure your unable toenail anymore

261
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,960
I can't

262
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
Then it's just right.

263
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,080
The medicine for the pain today

264
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
has just been sent out.

265
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,280
You can come and get it

266
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,560
at this time tomorrow.

267
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,800
Doctor, I have a stomachache.

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,160
Please help me take a look.

269
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,080
I heard that the price of rice has been rising

270
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
in Suizhou recently.

271
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,920
Does Magistrate Zhao know why?

272
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,680
I'm also very strange.

273
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,160
Please give me some advice.

274
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,400
His Majesty sent me to the south.

275
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
I guess someone is secretly committing crimes

276
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,000
and uniting the local rich and rich

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,040
to raise the price of rice.

278
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,880
He wants to borrow the opportunity to

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
take a look at me.

280
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,640
Who dares to do such a bold thing?

281
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,680
Who is it?

282
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,480
Magistrate Zhao.

283
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,840
Marquis Xuan Yin.

284
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,520
The price of rice has risen.

285
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,720
The people are not hungry.

286
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm afraid...

287
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,080
Back off.

288
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,840
But...

289
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,240
Didn't you see the marquis

290
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,720
talking about important things with me?

291
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,560
Back off.

292
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Stop talking.

293
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,840
Back off.

294
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,760
Back off.

295
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,520
Back off!

296
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,480
Back off!

297
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,200
Badú.

298
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,560
Sit tight.

299
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,360
Back off!

300
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
Badú.

301
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,200
Badú.

302
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,880
Back off!

303
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,600
Back off!

304
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,680
Badú.

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,280
Sir.

306
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,600
Sir.
