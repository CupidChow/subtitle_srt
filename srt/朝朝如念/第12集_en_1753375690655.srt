The Legend of Qingcheng

Episode 16

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Zhao Peng's mouth is hard.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We've been interrogating him for five days,

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but he still doesn't open his mouth.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, we can only hope that Mrs. Ji

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
will come back with the government

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to make him confess his crime.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My Lord,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
a woman from the front gate of the county office is requesting an audience.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Zhang's Mansion

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yunzhao.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Guards.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Send in the guests.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I took the bag to take the incense for Sister Qingyang.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
On the way to Suizhou,

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I came to report a murder case.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A murder case?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,500
I...

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,720
Ji Yunzhao, the doctor of the Jishi Hospital,

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,600
was killed by the people of the grassland.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
If you are loyal to me,

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,240
I will let him go.

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,480
You have my word.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,080
Ji Yunzhao, the wife of the Marquis of Xuanyin,

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,240
was killed by the people of the grassland.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,960
If you are loyal to me,

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
I will let you go.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Do you have any evidence?

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,880
Mrs. Ji.

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Where is Marquis of Xuanyin?

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
He just went out.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,040
Where?

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Ji Yunzhao's Mansion

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
Let go.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,760
Are you afraid?

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
If you are, close your eyes.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,600
If you and your friends

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,680
help Ji Yunzhao destroy the evidence,

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,800
then you should hide behind others.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
But in this case,

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,760
you are the only one who is loyal to me.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,280
After Ji Yunzhao goes to prison,

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,800
I will help you.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,600
What do you think?

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Long time no see.

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,160
Yunzhao.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
There seems to be a body here.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,640
Get the murderers back.

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,280
Wait.

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,880
He is just a fake.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you planning to frame me again?

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,500
Qiu Xian,

56
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
you can stop.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Put the knife away.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Are you okay?

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Qiu Xian,

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Qiu Xian,

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Qiu Xian, drink it.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He's a real man.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lan Fu,

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to make firewood.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How did you get in?

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Your son was a guard.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I told him I could wash your wrongs.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He let me in.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are really a father and son.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Did you get rid of Ji Yunzhao?

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good news and bad news?

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Which one do you want to hear first?

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good news.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then I'll tell you the bad news first.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ji Yunzhao's murder case

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
is not going to work.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This time he took the lead

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and ruined the evidence.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then I'm suffering for nothing.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Aren't you a god?

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Aren't you omnipotent?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
God, god, god, I can hear my ears grow.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Everything changes in an instant.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There will be a failure.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If you ask again,

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll pull your tongue out.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What about the good news?

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The one who brought up the case to His Majesty

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
was my husband.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think your evidence

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is in his hands now.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
At that time, I will try to destroy him.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are not ready to admit your guilt.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Your death sentence

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
was sent to the capital early on.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There is no evidence.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How can you be guilty?

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What if I don't go back to the city?

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tomorrow is the trial.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can see me.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Touch my right ear and it will be done.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's going on?

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's going on?

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's going on?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's going on?

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's going on?

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's going on?

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's going on?

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's going on?

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What's going on?

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Who is it?

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm Song Ruyuan,

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the daughter of the imperial envoy Song Hongjian.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What's the reason for the great injustice?

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Three years ago,

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
my father was ordered to go south to the disaster relief in Suizhou.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He found out that the Suizhou county magistrate Zhao Peng

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
was corrupt and bribe.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He colluded with the local hao shan,

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the Hongtai family and the Zhongbao family.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My father was accused of several crimes.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He wanted to report it.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Zhao Peng didn't stop his words and

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
he dragged the whole Song family.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He will repeat all the crimes.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Zhao Peng, do you know your guilt?

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I love my country and I care about the people.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's the guilt?

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's clearly that Song Hongjian

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
has changed a pound of rice into four pounds of rice.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He's trying to help the disaster relief.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Even if he secretly took the money,

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I found out that

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
he wanted to report it to the court.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Song Hongjian,

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
he burned the house

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and committed suicide.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sir, you're lying.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm lying?

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who else

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
remembers three years ago

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
that the disaster relief food

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
was made by the court's subordinates?

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Rice or rice grains?

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It was rice grains.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was made from rice.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It was Song Hongjian who didn't give it to us.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
One pound of rice was made from four pounds of rice grains.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The rest of the three pounds of rice was made from his own pocket.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's the guilt.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, that's the guilt.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The rice price rose.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The country was in a crisis.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My father asked for help to change the rice grains

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so that more people could eat it.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're joking.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're lying.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You said that I was a corrupt and framed the rice grains.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you have evidence?

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Evidence?

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You destroyed the evidence.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How dare you!

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You framed me without evidence.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, where's the evidence?

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where's the evidence?

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm doing this on purpose.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There's nothing too difficult to duration.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No one can achieve this.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Now all the court's ministers

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
are so angry with this poor girl.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How北平不懼

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
With this ab differs from çao warranty's

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is nonsense.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're too much. How could they do this to Lord Zhou?

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They're so cruel. How could they beat him?

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're saying I'm cruel?

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you have proof, why don't you bring it out?

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Summon the witness, Ji Yunzhang.

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I, Ji Yunzhang, greet you, Lord Zhou.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Bring the evidence.

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't have the evidence.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Did Ji Yunzhang ask you for help?

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where's the evidence?

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't have the evidence.

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Destroy him.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Marquis, where's the evidence?

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Where's the evidence?

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The evidence is here.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Bring it here.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You saw it yourself last night. I destroyed the evidence.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Prepare the horse. I'm going to report to the prison.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't let anyone take the lead.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Master, we'll set off together.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Before we set off, let's change our outfits.

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If we want to change, we'll change completely.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You entered the palace to meet the Emperor.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You took the fake evidence.

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You want me to take the real evidence?

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't have the palace token.

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can't enter the palace and meet the Emperor.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Pei Yan doesn't have the token?

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
His Majesty has already taken the token.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How did you enter the palace?

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I went to see Zhou Junlan.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I knew he was strong and powerful.

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can convince him.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Half a tooth?

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Half a tooth.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How can it be the real evidence?

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The deceased can't speak.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But his bones will be clear.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Zhao Peng, you said Song Hongjian was poisoned and committed suicide.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I opened the door and checked.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I found that his 32 teeth were black.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I took them apart.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I found that they were black inside and outside.

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is not a re-injection, but a poisoning.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I told you he committed suicide for the sake of the crime.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This poison is called the third half.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If someone drinks this poison,

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the poison will follow the vomit into the stomach and then into the blood.

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It will be cleared by the whole body of the whole body.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
His teeth and bones will be clear.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you know this?

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
How can I not know if this poison is called the third half?

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But when I was checking the body,

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I found that Song Hongjian's teeth were black.

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But his 206 bones were white.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
His skull, rib cage, rib, rib, and bone,

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
there are marks of being hit by the nail.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is terrible.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's really terrible.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's so terrible.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So, Song Hongjian was beaten to death.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The murderer forced the poison to him after he was dead.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Then he faked his suicide.

240
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So this poison is only on his teeth, not his bones.

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He was beaten to death.

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What does this have to do with me?

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I found a few pieces of broken paper in his coffin.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you put them together,

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you can see the contents of the letter.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's the page in the letter that you and the local haoshen were in.

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's also your and Zhao Peng's seal on it.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Impossible! Absolutely impossible!

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
How could you?

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Maybe you're guilty.

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You ordered someone to kill Song Hongjian,

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but he didn't dare to kill him.

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Instead, he ordered someone to bury his four limbs in the coffin.

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He wanted to turn them over after he was dead.

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's why the paper in his coffin was kept.

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The rain was falling.

257
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
His coffin was discovered.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Nonsense!

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's you. It's definitely you.

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You found a body and faked the evidence.

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's why you framed me.

262
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Song Ruyuan, I remember you said your father had six children.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

264
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
His coffin is in the county office.

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The Xuanying Duke sent someone to check it.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wait.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Everyone knows you're the fiancee of the Xuanying Duke.

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's hard for him to convince everyone.

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Zhao Yan!

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You go.

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The Xuanying Duke

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My lord.

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are there six fingers in the coffin?

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes.

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Everyone can believe it.

277
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But what about the son?

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He's definitely right.

279
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Even the son said so.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How can he be wrong?

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's true.

282
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Zhao Peng, Huotong, Zhao Qian, Wang Wu, Fang Daxin, and others

283
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
have raised the price of rice and searched for the rice cake.

284
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They hid the fact that the murderer was a murderer.

285
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
They framed the man.

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is there any evidence that proves it?

287
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes.

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You go to the 13 people on the list.

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Take them to the dungeon.

290
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Kill them in the autumn.

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes.

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Zhao Peng, you're not allowed to do anything illegal.

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You should be killed in three days.

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait.

295
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then...

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He...

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Should be killed in three days.

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The End
