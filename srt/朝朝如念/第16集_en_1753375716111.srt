00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,560
Episode 16

3
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,460
This is not right.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
What's wrong?

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
Three years ago,

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,440
Zhou Junlan's officials

7
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,200
bought 80 ships from the shipyard

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,080
for the delivery of the red arrow

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
and the shipwreck on the price list

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,720
was all provided by the Gu family

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
which is three times more expensive than usual.

12
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,520
Could it be that the Gu family is in cahoots with the shipyard

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,040
and needs to raise the price of the iron shipwreck

14
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,760
and then give the various extra prices

15
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,120
to the official as a remuneration?

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,520
This matter needs to be discussed in detail.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Now the ship is parked in the capital.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,640
But the iron arrow is fixed on the shipboard.

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,440
It's still unknown

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
on the surface.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,760
So,

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,000
will you investigate it?

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,960
Of course.

24
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,880
But how?

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,960
Mr. Zhou,

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,760
do you have money?

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,560
Yes.

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,040
How much?

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,600
I hope you can live a carefree life

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,800
and enjoy the beauty.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,080
Enough.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,840
Let's go.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Where?

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
The shipyard.

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
I won't go there for now.

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
If you don't go,

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,280
you'll be robbed of your status.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
You still don't believe me?

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,200
How could it be?

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Recently,

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,080
Mrs. Qiu has helped me a lot.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
You said you could see the future.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
I believe it.

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,920
See the future?

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,920
But it's not.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
What do you mean?

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,920
This is rice cake.

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,160
If fate

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,680
makes this rice cake before the science,

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,880
the Tang's people will follow the original track

51
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,560
and find this cake.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,800
This is the future I see.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,960
But if a person finds the cake,

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
but doesn't report it to the emperor,

55
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
will the ants

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,160
find this cake?

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,480
Maybe they will.

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,680
Maybe they won't.

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
It's fate.

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,880
The ants

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,840
will have a cake.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,720
But they

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
have a traitor.

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
At this time,

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
the future of the cake

66
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
will be...

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360
biased.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,160
You can see the direction of fate.

69
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,840
You die in the night.

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,120
But you can't control the changes in your fate.

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
This is not...

72
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
It's clear.

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,400
This is

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,800
the way to teach.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
So,

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,120
you know the world well.

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,280
It's because you see the future.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,160
There's no change.

79
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,840
Of course.

80
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
You're talented.

81
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
I admire you.

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
Ji Yunzhao is talented.

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Not me.

84
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,640
I just put down

85
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,400
the rice cake before he learned it.

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
Since it's your destiny,

87
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,600
why did you become

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,960
a mule in the hole?

89
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
I just

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
had a moment of happiness.

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,640
Ji Yunzhao is talented.

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,640
But his destiny is

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
to be taken back

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,760
by someone

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
who is not good enough.

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,640
I'm different from him.

97
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,000
He's a mule struggling for life.

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm

99
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,160
the hand of Yuduo.

100
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,080
Everything he's been through

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,080
is what you've been through.

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,200
Yes.

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,760
And no.

104
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,360
I used to be my destiny,

105
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,360
watching over everything.

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
You were there.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,520
Pei Yan,

108
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
you saved the country,

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
saved the people,

110
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,040
and saved the people.

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,800
You were just

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,400
a stepping stone for Ji Yunzhao.

113
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,040
I've seen your destiny.

114
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,600
If Ji Yunzhao gets revenge,

115
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,720
you'll be abandoned.

116
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Instead of being used by him,

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,080
why don't you

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
return to me?

119
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,280
If I get revenge, I'll get revenge.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,040
He didn't tell you?

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
Then

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
I'll keep it a secret.

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,720
Why did you tell me this?

124
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,400
Because

125
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm a good teacher.

126
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm a good teacher.

127
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,800
And

128
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,640
I've been good to Zhou Junlan.

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
And now

130
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
I'm interested in you.

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
Have you made up your mind?

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,480
Give me

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
some time to think about it.

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,160
I'm not patient.

135
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,760
I can help you.

136
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,040
Since you trust me,

137
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll remind you one more thing.

138
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Zhou Junlan and Ji Yunzhao

139
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
went to the shipyard overnight.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,640
Should we go

141
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
or not?

142
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
We won't go.

143
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,680
Why?

144
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,440
It's better

145
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
to let others pay.

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,880
Mr. Zhou.

147
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,160
This way, please.

148
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,720
Look.

149
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,200
This is the ship.

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
Is this one

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
the ship that the court

152
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
ordered three years ago?

153
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
Of course.

154
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,280
I dare not lie to you.

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,360
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

156
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,240
If there's anything else

157
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,080
I can do for you,

158
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
I'll do anything to help.

159
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Burn it.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,680
What?

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,680
No.

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,200
Of course.

163
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Since you've bought the ship,

164
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,040
how can you deal with it?

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
It's up to you to do it.

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,200
What is Mr. Zhou thinking about?

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
Let's burn the atmosphere.

168
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,160
For that reason.

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Mr. Zhou

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
I'm not sure.

171
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,080
Lord Zhou You is a man of great talent.

172
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
He's good at making beautiful women smile.

173
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,640
He's a man of great talent.

174
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,520
He's a man of great talent.

175
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Besides,

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,720
what?

177
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,880
It's not appropriate

178
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
to compare us.

179
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,760
I think it's not bad.

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
If you like it,

181
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll give it to you.

182
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,760
Qiu Baosui.

183
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,800
You're so sharp.

184
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you for your compliment.

185
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,440
What are you doing here?

186
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,760
The ship's price is three times higher than the ship's price.

187
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,920
It's too boring to take the ship out.

188
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
Why don't you buy a ship?

189
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
Wait a minute.

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll take the ship out.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
I bought this ship.

192
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,720
What does it have to do with you?

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
Of course not.

194
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm just looking.

195
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,680
Lord Zhou.

196
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
The ship you want is here.

197
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll count the number of the ship

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
according to your order.

199
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,040
Please have a look.

200
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,720
The calculation of the Gu family's bill

201
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,440
and the number of nails needed for a ship

202
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,320
can be compared with this bill.

203
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
But why

204
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,480
is this nail three times more expensive

205
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
than the ordinary nail?

206
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
This nail is made of cast iron.

207
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
It's more durable than the ordinary nail.

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,560
Leave.

209
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,200
Have the Gu family's bill been settled?

210
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,400
Yes.

211
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,200
One out of eleven officers in the case

212
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,280
is the one who has the most

213
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,320
money in the Gu family.

214
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,160
No.

215
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,440
In the past few days,

216
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
we've collected over 300 bills.

217
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,560
63 people were involved in the case.

218
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,200
The bill is fine.

219
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,160
Why is the nail

220
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,440
on the ship

221
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
the Crown Prince of the South?

222
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,000
The North has been buried for years.

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Life is turbulent.

224
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
The Crown Prince of the North has a lot of money.

225
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,880
And because of the turbulent North,

226
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,960
the meeting place is located in the South.

227
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,880
The Crown Prince of the North has traveled a long way

228
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
and has been tired.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,160
He is not in good condition.

230
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,000
If the South is hot,

231
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
the water and soil are not suitable,

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
the above is the reason.

233
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,000
How could you not know?

234
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,960
Your Majesty,

235
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
I've checked the eleven officers

236
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,760
that the Crown Prince of the South has sent.

237
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
There's no problem.

238
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,680
I know.

239
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
Then why did you...

240
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,440
I and Zhan Wu led the army to the death

241
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,520
and opened the river and dug the soil.

242
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,760
It's been 21 years since we came here.

243
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm old.

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
Your Majesty.

245
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
The Great Sha River is clear.

246
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,760
How could we hold on to those scoundrels?

247
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,600
The North is constantly harassed.

248
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
It's already turbulent.

249
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,340
This SERT or SERT messiah

250
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,840
is aervant and inlet service.

251
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,760
I ordered Great Sha of Zhou to enthusiastic salute

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
not to offend the front to serve the proper shall.

253
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,320
I mean to send a chicken to silence.

254
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,640
Then I will send them to capture more than a dozen Crown Prince.

255
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,480
They'll leader the people in the North

256
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,680
and secure the nation.

257
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,280
He

258
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,400
is not loyal to me!

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,160
His heart is extremely sincere!

260
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,800
Thebo's subservience

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,700
and the rig日本 as an opponents

262
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,400
is a commonkship

263
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,400
A 500,000 kilometers to take

264
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,360
WhichOK

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,400
Let me руки

266
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,020
Letxia

267
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,280
Banxia

268
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,720
I order Marquis Xuan Ying to investigate again.

269
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,760
Until we find out the problem,

270
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
we'll kill

271
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
the 51 people and Zhou Junlan

272
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,760
at the same time.

273
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Now,

274
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,680
there are 63 people in total.

275
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,480
63 lives

276
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,280
and the glorious future ahead.

277
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm curious

278
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,560
how Marquis Xuan Ying

279
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,880
will take the blame.

280
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
Your Majesty,

281
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,200
Marquis Xuan Ying wants to see you.

282
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
Summon him.

283
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,000
Your Majesty,

284
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,400
I've investigated the South and North case thoroughly.

285
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,960
There are 51 people in the case,

286
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,880
one examiner,

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
and 11 officers of the capital.

288
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,240
They all have the right to take the blame.

289
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
There's nothing wrong with that.

290
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,800
According to the law of our country,

291
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
how should we deal with them?

292
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,320
They should be executed

293
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,640
by the corrupt officials.

294
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,680
However,

295
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
there are many people in the case.

296
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm afraid that there are too many people

297
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,160
and it will disturb the dragon's pulse.

298
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,640
How about

299
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
sending a good official

300
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,640
to Liangzhou to deal with them?

301
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,640
That's good.

302
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,280
However,

303
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,800
the officers and soldiers who are under pressure

304
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,120
are my people.

305
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,360
If anything goes wrong,

306
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,160
I'll interrogate you.

307
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

308
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,240
Victor,

309
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,560
this is the letterning from the capital.

310
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
Here.

311
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
We were in need.

312
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,040
Miss Jingable's annoyance

313
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
is disfteoking background.

314
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,760
We haven't heard the micronという

315
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,760
you helped bring us here.

316
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,000
What is that?

317
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
I, Jue Ru, cannot bear to die.

318
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Heaven is silent.

319
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
The world is unfair.

320
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,480
I admit it.

321
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,680
I admit it.

322
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,080
The world is unfair.

323
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
It's about to rain.

324
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,280
The rain will not stop for a long time.

325
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm afraid something bad will happen.

326
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:52,920
On the way to the

327
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
world, there is such a great city.

328
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
What I said is all true.

329
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
I would never dare to deceive the king.

330
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
What do you have to say?

331
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,720
This is a natural disaster.

332
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
No one can do it.

333
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Minister Jiang.

334
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,920
Since it's a natural disaster, it's already a natural disaster.

335
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
The high heaven has eyes.

336
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm not willing to blood-suck the soil.

337
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,920
So I did this.

338
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,120
To help you get rid of the trouble in your heart.

339
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
And get a good reputation.

340
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
Although it's a natural disaster,

341
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,720
according to the law, it should be punished.

342
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,120
I will punish the Xuan Yin Duke to go to the capital.

343
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Tomorrow, I will go to the Dali Temple to punish myself.

344
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Zhou Shi Lang, you come to supervise.

345
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Yes.

346
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Yes.

347
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Yes.

348
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Your Majesty.

349
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Taoist Ye is waiting outside.

350
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,520
But Taoist Ye is good at immortality.

351
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
That's right.

352
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Hurry up.

353
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
Hurry up and come in.

354
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Yes.

355
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Hurry.

356
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,120
The account book.

357
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Zhou Shi Lang.

358
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Do you want to protect your 11 lives?

359
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,520
If I want to, I will.

360
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,120
Then we can make a deal.

361
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,520
If I can do it,

362
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,720
you can give me Zhao Peng's account book.

363
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,920
That mountain collapse was told to you by Qiu Xian Er.

364
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
So what?

365
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,520
You can stand it.

366
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Since you have made a choice,

367
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
you should give up your position.

368
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,520
Now, you should let go.

369
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
It's me.

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
It's me.

371
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
It's me.

372
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
It's me.

373
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
I have to fight with you.

374
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Then I will only be with you till the end.

375
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Forty times.

376
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,720
Without Ji Yun Zhao,

377
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,320
I will see how you can stand it.

378
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,720
I will only be with you till the end.
