00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Zhao Zhao, I was waiting for death in the burial ground.

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You saved me.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm your mother and father.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now you're going to marry me.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can I ask you for something?

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Of course. As long as I have it.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I want your life.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Zhao Zhao.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Juewen.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're poisoned.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just got some blood.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Take me to the hospital.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It hurts.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But I, Gu Zhao Zhao,

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
even if my life is destroyed

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and I become a ghost,

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I will never let you go.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Long Ballad

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Congratulations to Zhou Sheren for becoming the deputy minister.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You've made a great progress.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Zhou Sheren.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, no.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Zhou Shi Lang.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now you're a great man.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And you're close to your wife.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're so jealous.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thanks to your grace,

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can help you.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I will do my best to serve the country.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I won't disappoint you.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Zhou Shi Lang.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The wine is here.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Put this over there.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please enjoy.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Enjoy.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mr. Fang.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My lord.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where are my two bowls of double moon and white?

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
My lord, please forgive me.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Today, the double moon and white are already light.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We've been waiting here for a whole day.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You just finished selling them.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My brother and my mother took our deposit.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How can you give us a discount?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can double the payment.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You...

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Forget it.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's go.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Today is the death anniversary of my lord.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Marquis Xuan Ying is going to pay his respects to my lord.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Zhou Shi Lang.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I heard that my lord loved to drink double moon and white.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's good that there's still one left in the room.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm willing to give it to you to express my love.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sorry, my lord.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a pity.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But my lord has already served the enemy.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The wine is already spilled on the ground.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My lord can't drink it anymore.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There's still some wine left.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Marquis Xuan Ying, please drink it yourself.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No?

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Are you dissatisfied with the crime of

75
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,000
imprisoning my lord and

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
punishing him for his crime?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Or you feel unfair to his majesty?

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
His majesty is kind.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's a great official.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He's the heir of the Pei family.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is a great favor.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How can Marquis Xuan Ying be unfair?

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's filial.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't joke, my lord.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thank you, Zhou Shi Lang.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
For the wine.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Theison music is as miles out in its destaunded lifespan.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's as quick-witted as a spotted Sage.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hi.

90
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
Ar stereotyled as the Goldenhomme,

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,280
what is the meaning of injustice?

92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Sealed the wall,

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
there is a div Bone of Buddha.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Wei Huantai.

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,000
Wei Huantai.

96
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,080
Wei Huantai.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,040
You idiot

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,080
We're all gaan

99
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,560
You should rest

100
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,240
I think

101
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,800
Third drill sergeant

102
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,840
Miss Wu

103
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,760
Miss Wu

104
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,960
How are you Ping'er

105
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,080
Thank you

106
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,240
Who are these thing

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,300
Josha

108
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,640
habitants

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,360
Look, you're in charge

110
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Let me see

111
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,160
Cr resource

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
completely

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,960
Let me see

114
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,040
I'll send it to you

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,680
Don't worry

116
00:07:51,340 --> 00:08:11,020
It's

117
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,100
really odd

118
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,380
stop getting a veil

119
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
CHANCHAN

120
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,860
I got some stained mo Santiago

121
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,740
please agree to my woman's Hope Letter.

122
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,460
Did you find out what happened?

123
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,300
That woman was called Ji Yunzhao,

124
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,940
so she established a clinic in Changxiao.

125
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,020
Sister Chaozhou is so funny.

126
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,020
Did you think you didn't even know her

127
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,740
after you changed her name?

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
That's great.

129
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,980
I've been thinking about him lately.

130
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,980
Xing, you're naive.

131
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,740
You should be careful.

132
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,740
Careful about what?

133
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,380
I've never harmed him.

134
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,220
It was Zhao Zhao who

135
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
made it hard for herself to escape from the marriage.

136
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,900
Zhao Zhao,

137
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,460
this poison doesn't hurt.

138
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,860
Don't struggle.

139
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,540
Don't get hurt again.

140
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
Don't come over.

141
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,380
Zhao Zhao.

142
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,340
Xing.

143
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,700
You're poisoned.

144
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,940
Take me to the clinic.

145
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,540
Okay.

146
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,460
Xing, he...

147
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,140
I'm afraid you...

148
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,700
Your hair looks good.

149
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,940
From now on,

150
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,740
you can tell me every day.

151
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
Okay.

152
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,340
This is bad, bad!

153
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
It'sreek a pani to quench his blush!

154
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,620
What's wrong?

155
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,660
It's really hard to run away!

156
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,260
What did you say?

157
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,820
Fanzhou!

158
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,780
Are you all right, Fanzhou?

159
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Heweeks,

160
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,920
he euched his anger

161
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,220
on possible reunions.

162
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,780
He's slowly recovering.

163
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,020
I hate you.

164
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,500
I will make it up to you.

165
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,500
This is my signature,

166
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,620
pearl milk tea.

167
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,540
It's made by our madam Qiu.

168
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,700
Please enjoy.

169
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,060
Why did your madam invite me here?

170
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,060
She said she wanted to go with her old friend.

171
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,620
It's my first time here.

172
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,460
What can I learn?

173
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
I don't know.

174
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,860
Please enjoy.

175
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,260
If my father didn't force me,

176
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,020
I wouldn't be here.

177
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,820
I'm guilty.

178
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,660
And I have no evidence.

179
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,620
Even His Majesty is angry.

180
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,300
So no one dares to marry me.

181
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,100
My lady is the pearl in Minister Jiang's palm.

182
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,100
I have no qualms about it.

183
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,060
You are really a good man.

184
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,700
But Mr. Zhou Junlan is from a lowly family.

185
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,300
He has nothing to rely on.

186
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,700
Marquis Xuanying is a royal family.

187
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,580
He wants to be respected and be respected.

188
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,940
But he is not good enough.

189
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,380
Please teach me.

190
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,180
Mr. Zhou is indeed a young man.

191
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,540
Of course.

192
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,780
I must match a man like him.

193
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,820
But he is a man of deep character.

194
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,100
There must be a better woman.

195
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,100
Why are we here?

196
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,660
To watch a play.

197
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,100
Gu Chaozhao.

198
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,660
You are back.

199
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,820
You mistook me for someone else.

200
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,020
You eloped with me when you were married.

201
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,100
What?

202
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,860
You forget your ex-boyfriend?

203
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,740
You eloped with me.

204
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,460
You changed your lover one by one.

205
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,100
Now you are back.

206
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,500
You want to be your love flower again?

207
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
You are a woman of the world.

208
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,300
How dare you come back?

209
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,500
The wild grass in the mud is no match for Mrs. Qiu.

210
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,820
People are not goods.

211
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,140
They are all valuable.

212
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,540
Really?

213
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,620
But I am not good enough.

214
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,380
The cloud is white and the embroidery is in the forest.

215
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,260
But in my opinion,

216
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,140
the wild grass in the mud is no match for the wild grass in the winter.

217
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,580
I am not Gu Chaozhao.

218
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,700
If what you said is true,

219
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,380
according to the law of our dynasty,

220
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,660
the one who elopes with a woman of the Guiliang family will be punished 50 times.

221
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,900
It is ignorant to confess your crime in broad daylight.

222
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,300
It is a despicable mistake to defame a woman's reputation.

223
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,660
So,

224
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,060
do you still recognize what you just said?

225
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,820
I...

226
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,500
I do.

227
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,260
Okay.

228
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,100
Let's go to the court.

229
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,980
I was beaten up.

230
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,100
And you,

231
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,460
as a woman, you will be executed.

232
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,340
Do you dare to do that?

233
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,820
I am not her.

234
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,140
Why should I dare not?

235
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,980
How can you prove that you are not her?

236
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,340
You are the one who offended me.

237
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,940
You are the one who defamed me.

238
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,420
Why should I prove it?

239
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,460
Now you need to give me the evidence.

240
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,300
Or you can kneel down and beg for my forgiveness.

241
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,660
Or you will be punished.

242
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,340
What?

243
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,740
The second marriage of the Liang family of Qingbo.

244
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,220
If this woman has a marriage contract,

245
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,300
she will be punished 100 times.

246
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,940
You...

247
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,140
How can you have a marriage contract?

248
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,980
My fiance

249
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,300
is both talented,

250
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,140
handsome and good-looking.

251
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,740
Compared to him,

252
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,980
he is...

253
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,060
a scoundrel.

254
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,340
Your parents have given you so many talents.

255
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,540
What do you call them?

256
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,900
Scoundrel.

257
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,980
Such a talented man.

258
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,580
Who is he?

259
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,260
Your Highness.

260
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,660
It was just a lie.

261
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,980
A lie.

262
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,340
Please don't cheat her.

263
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,580
The Marquis of Xuanyin, Peiyan.

264
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:13,740
Thanks for watching!
