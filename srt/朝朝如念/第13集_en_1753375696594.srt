00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,320
I heard that you are a maid

4
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
picked up by the Zhao family.

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
I also heard that

7
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,680
you were acting in the street before.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,280
Zhao Yan took you to the clinic.

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,240
Zhao Peng paid for your treatment.

10
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Yes.

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,440
In your heart,

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,000
how did the Zhao family treat you?

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,880
They treated me

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,160
as a mere tool

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,840
at the court court.

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
Great.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,880
Danke.

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Great.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,000
Since she is your mistress,

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,240
she is also a savior.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
But you set fire

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,880
at the witch-reszas that she fell into the other day.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
That's because Zhao Peng

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,660
ண & other people had exchanged witch-reszas

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,360
to seek divorce.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,380
Then you situations are

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
The daughter of the emperor is going to report her grudges

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,380
and send her benefactor, the master, to the execution ground.

29
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,380
The servant is willing to betray her master to death.

30
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,380
According to the law of our dynasty, what should be the punishment?

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
The punishment should be

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,380
the execution.

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,380
There is more mercy than the punishment.

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I have the responsibility of both sides.

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,380
As long as you can understand and understand,

36
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,380
I will forgive you.

37
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,380
I will forgive Zhao Peng.

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,380
Then Ru Yuan will not have to die.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,380
I know.

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,380
I know he is guilty.

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
He is unforgivable.

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,380
You can punish him.

43
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,380
I can accept Liu Fang, even if he is a slave.

44
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,380
I just beg you to spare their lives.

45
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,380
I am willing to pay back the debt of gratitude to you.

46
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,380
I beg you.

47
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,380
I beg you.

48
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
He is not a good official.

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,380
But he is my father.

50
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,380
I will never forgive him.

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,380
I will never forgive him.

52
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,380
If you don't win,

53
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,380
I will never lose.

54
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,380
Right?

55
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
I will never lose.

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,380
I will never lose.

57
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,380
I will never lose.

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,380
I will never lose.

59
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
Ruo Yan.

60
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,380
Do you remember that day we first met?

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,620
I remember

62
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,860
On my 18th birthday

63
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,260
I made a wish

64
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,260
You promised me

65
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,540
you would be lucky

66
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,740
and fulfill my wish

67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Do you know

68
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,060
what I want?

69
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,620
To grow old together

70
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,500
No, Zhao Yan

71
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,020
I want to go home

72
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
Go home?

73
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,580
But my home is not here

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,260
My home is in Huiyue

75
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Yue

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
Yue

77
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Yue

78
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Yue

79
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Yue

80
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Yue

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,700
She was poisoned first

82
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,520
This is po

83
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,220
Yue

84
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,900
namely

85
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,100
You read it once again

86
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,180
Could you

87
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,020
read it again?

88
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,780
We will be置 cremation

89
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,720
In this life we'll live in glue

90
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,820
We can't beopard

91
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:37,820
I finally get to see you off.

92
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
A'Yu. A'Yu.

93
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Zhao Pang is a thief.

94
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
He is corrupt and corrupt.

95
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
He is a traitor to the people.

96
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Zhao Lv.

97
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,820
I...

98
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,820
This time, he won.

99
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
I hope so.

100
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
You can see the future.

101
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Why did you lose to him?

102
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
What are you doing?

103
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
You are so shameless.

104
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
How can you say such shameless words?

105
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,820
I have been running around in Suizhou.

106
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I have been giving you a chance to train me.

107
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,820
You are the one who has been hiding.

108
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
It's all my fault.

109
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
What else?

110
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
This is new.

111
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Usually, when Jin Yanzhao is with you,

112
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
you are always in front of me.

113
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,820
But now, you are here to chat with me.

114
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Is it because of this failure that you are in a good mood?

115
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
How come?

116
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Why don't you dare to look at me?

117
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
I can't see you. I can't feel your heart.

118
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
When you are happy,

119
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
you can't tolerate old love.

120
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
You are a traitor and you don't want to help.

121
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
That's why you lost to Pei Yan.

122
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Pei Yan.

123
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
So that's the case.

124
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
You don't care about my life.

125
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
You have found a way out from him.

126
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Why are you laughing?

127
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
I am laughing at your stupidity.

128
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
It seems that in your eyes,

129
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I am always thinking about competing with Jin Yanzhao for a man.

130
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Is it because of money, power, fame?

131
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
You are so ungrateful.

132
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
You pretend to be a woman.

133
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
I must have made you angry by breaking the horse.

134
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Is it over?

135
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
You can make me go out.

136
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Of course, I can.

137
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Why is it like this?

138
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Just curious.

139
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I am not asking about money.

140
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Why did you

141
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
watch him die?

142
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Say you didn't.

143
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
I did.

144
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
If you say you didn't, I will believe you.

145
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
I did.

146
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
You met him in private.

147
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
You knew his plan at that time.

148
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
When did you know?

149
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,820
You were in the court just now.

150
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
I heard you say

151
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Song Ruyuan, I remember you said

152
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
your father was born with six children.

153
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
You only met him once in the fire.

154
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
He was unconscious at that time.

155
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,820
He surrendered himself to the prison when he woke up.

156
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
What happened?

157
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
When he rushed into the sea of fire to save me.

158
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Master, come with me.

159
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Mo Qing, I didn't know you were the one who killed him.

160
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
I know what you want to do.

161
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
I can help you.

162
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
How did you know?

163
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
From my dream.

164
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Why not save him?

165
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Even if it's a matter of life.

166
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
You were going to kill him.

167
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I killed him because of the law.

168
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
I have to marry him.

169
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,820
But what about you?

170
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,820
What are you doing?

171
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
What are you doing?

172
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
I want you to help me defeat Zhou Junlan.

173
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
You want me to help you to make up for Mingyuan.

174
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
We all have our own ambitions.

175
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
We all need to rely on the whole world to achieve our wishes.

176
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Since we have to go up.

177
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
It's hard to meet the difficult danger on the way.

178
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
No matter how you do it behind your back.

179
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
You don't have to be surprised.

180
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
In the world, you have to be bright and bright.

181
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Killing him will make me lose my people.

182
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
You don't want to hinder me because of this.

183
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
No.

184
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
It's your way to the heaven.

185
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
You just don't want to save him.

186
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I don't want to save him.

187
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
I just respect his choice.

188
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Besides.

189
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,820
This is what he wants.

190
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
So.

191
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
You can ignore the people.

192
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
What about me?

193
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
In your heart.

194
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
I'm just a pawn.

195
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
You let me live.

196
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
You let me die.

197
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
I'll die.

198
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
I help you get what you want.

199
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm not using you.

200
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
You're using me.

201
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Say you're not.

202
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
I.

203
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
I know.

204
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm not using you.

205
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm not using you.

206
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm not using you.

207
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm not using you.

208
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I'm not using you.

209
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I'm not using you.

210
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I'm not using you.

211
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
I'm not using you.

212
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm not using you.

213
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
I'm not using you.

214
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
I'm not using you.

215
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm not using you.

216
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
I'm not using you.

217
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
I'm not using you.

218
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
I'm not using you.

219
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm not using you.

220
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
I'm not using you.

221
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I'm not using you.

222
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm not using you.

223
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
I'm not using you.

224
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
I'm not using you.

225
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
I'm not using you.

226
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm not using you.

227
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm not using you.

228
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
I'm not using you.

229
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I'm not using you.

230
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm not using you.

231
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
You asked me to say something?

232
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I know you've been running away from the old marquis' plan for many years.

233
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
You guessed it right.

234
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,820
But there was something wrong with the past.

235
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,820
You're willing to tell me now that you're dying.

236
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
I can tell you everything I know.

237
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
I can tell you everything I know.

238
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,820
But you have to promise me one thing.

239
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
Tell me.

240
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,820
If you ever come to a dead end,

241
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,820
can you help me?

242
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
I promise you.

243
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,820
There are two maps in the whole world.

244
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,820
One in the palace, one in the camp.

245
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,820
The map in the camp was indeed leaked by the old marquis.

246
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,820
The hidden flag is on me.

247
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,820
The map doesn't seem to be complete.

248
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,820
There's another person besides me.

249
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Who?

250
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
I don't know this person.

251
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Back then, there was a spy in the camp.

252
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
The old marquis didn't want the map to be stolen.

253
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
He printed the map on the back of this person and me.

254
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
If you want to burn the map,

255
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,820
you're afraid that the spy will steal the map.

256
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Then you...

257
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
I wasn't fooled.

258
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
Back then, the tiger man was the king of our army.

259
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Maybe...

260
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Maybe this person betrayed the old marquis.

261
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Then how should I find him?

262
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Back then, every day,

263
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
all the soldiers would go out to buy food.

264
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
The food was very fresh.

265
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,820
They would sell it in half a month.

266
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,820
In the army, only I would store the good stuff in the half of the month.

267
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
When they used up their money,

268
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,820
I would raise the price and sell it to them.

269
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,820
For years, I had a close relationship with all the soldiers in the camp.

270
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,820
I recorded everything on a book.

271
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Where is the book now?

272
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,820
It's in the hands of the old marquis.
