00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,160
Is she really not Gu Zhezhang?

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,720
There are two people who look alike under the sky.

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,000
Xing'er.

6
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,080
Look at you.

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,120
Am I that scary?

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,960
No.

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,760
You are the most beautiful woman in the world.

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,600
Really?

11
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm glad that you said that.

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,480
Then I'll reward you tonight.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,960
Xing'er.

14
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,560
I didn't save the Crown Prince today.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,880
Why?

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,800
Pei Yan saved the Crown Prince with the method you taught me.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,960
How could he use that method?

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,200
Ji Yunzhao was there.

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,880
I guess the Apothecary Valley knows how to save people.

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,400
Ji Yunzhao taught him.

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,280
Pei Yan saved the Crown Prince and made a contribution.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,840
He must have sent people to help him.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,280
If the power of the Marquis's Mansion is restored,

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,160
it will be of no use to the Central Command.

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,320
Xing'er.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,960
In your opinion,

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,880
who will be of use to me in the court?

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
After you serve me well,

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,320
I'll tell you

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
what to do.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,160
After all,

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm the only one who knows the direction of the story.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,720
Miss Jia.

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
This is the incense pouch you asked for.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,080
There's a medicine in the pouch that can't be used to drink.

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,800
It will cause a crush when it's used.

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
So, don't drink it when you're wearing it.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
I know.

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,760
I know.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,440
You put a lot of that medicine.

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,200
Miss Jia has severe insomnia.

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Of course I have to take the medicine.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,160
Besides, I've already told the people

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,680
where the medicine is.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,480
It's a good medicine.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
It should be good for your health.

47
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,980
Your Highness,

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:31,840
perhaps I still have some moments toGreat Sage able to resist节.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,860
Go.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,200
As you said,

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,640
in this grave country,

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,880
as Great Sage,

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,720
I must say,

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
Learn from myshovellor

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Governor Chou

56
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,560
improvement of all Clickction

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
Only the silver who边a better

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,760
I am always only

59
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,800
Sinful and denabilirous

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
This etiquette

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Doesn't need

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
The relationship between you and I

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Indeed in the final

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Come

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,640
I drank some at the party

66
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,680
Governor Chou

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,200
then

68
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,120
next time

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,760
We'll drink together.

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
I'll take my leave.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,360
I'll take my leave.

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
Old fox.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,640
Mr. Chong.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
We'll drink later.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Father, are you drunk?

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
No, I'm still awake.

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,280
Take father back first.

78
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
I have something to do.

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,320
Yes.

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,040
Mr. Zhou, what a coincidence.

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,120
What a coincidence.

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,560
What do you want from me?

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
I...

85
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I've been a fan of you for a long time.

86
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,040
I'm willing to be your wife

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,880
and accompany you around.

88
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
If you're willing to marry me,

89
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,480
my father will help you.

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
I've made a promise with my wife.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000
She's the only one in this life.

92
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,960
I was impolite.

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,280
Please don't blame me.

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Let me propose a toast to you.

95
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,200
Here.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
That thing.

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,440
Can it make Mr. Zhou lose something?

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,040
You touched your hand and foot in the wine.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,080
I...

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
Have you ever thought about the consequences of doing this?

101
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
What are you doing?

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,760
Let go.

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,400
Do what you want.

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,480
I didn't want this.

106
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
What are you doing?

107
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,720
Mr. Zhou, wake up.

108
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
Let go.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
Help.

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,400
Help.

111
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,720
Help.

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,960
Help.

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Help.

114
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Help.

115
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Help.

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Help.

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
Help.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
Help.

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,480
What's going on?

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,960
I didn't expect this.

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll take care of it.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Go home.

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll send you some medicine for the pain relief tomorrow.

124
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Director Qin.

125
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,720
I'll remember your kindness.

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,360
I love you.

127
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,800
I'll wait for you two.

128
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
Okay.

129
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,880
I love me.

130
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,360
Right.

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,560
Me too.

132
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,120
Do you know

133
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,120
I practiced for many times

134
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,280
to hide my feelings

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,840
and not hesitate to appeararing in front of you?

136
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,600
I feel restless

137
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
for lacking of movement

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
Even if I kill you thousands of times,

139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,400
I can't get rid of your hatred.

140
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
Just die like this?

141
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,640
It's too cheap.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,560
I have to go.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
There are many ways to get close to Zhou Junlan.

144
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,680
You don't need to lose your reputation for this.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,520
As long as I can achieve my goal,

146
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
I don't care about his reputation.

147
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,320
How can I lose his reputation?

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,640
What are you doing?

149
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Acting.

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm trying to be serious.

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Why are you laughing?

152
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
Your mark is too fake.

153
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Then you can bite me.

154
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
Here, eat this.

155
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,520
You!

156
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
Three!

157
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
Two!

158
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
What?

159
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,000
You dare not...

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:10:04,600
I

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
visor Zhou

162
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,660
Why are you here?

163
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,060
Don't you remember what happened last night?

164
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,260
Zhou Ying!

165
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,300
Let go!

166
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,660
What are you doing?

167
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,380
Help!

168
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,780
You were poisoned by the medicine of love.

169
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,940
You almost lost your memory.

170
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,340
I happened to pass by.

171
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,660
So I used the needle to cure your memory.

172
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,260
You just happened to pass by?

173
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,100
What do you think?

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,740
Did I do something wrong to you last night?

175
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,740
You just bit me when you were having the medicine.

176
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,340
I didn't mind.

177
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,900
You don't need to blame yourself.

178
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,660
Why is Ji Yunzhao and Zhou Shilang

179
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,180
from the same country?

180
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,100
They look the same.

181
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,780
They must have done something ridiculous last night.

182
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,940
I heard Zhou Shilang and his wife are close.

183
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,940
They are men.

184
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,900
There must be something going on.

185
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,820
I've seen too much.

186
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,620
I've seen too much.

187
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,460
I've seen too much.

188
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
I've seen too much.

189
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
My heart beats as fast as silk.

190
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,100
I can't do anything.

191
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,100
Why are you doing this to me?

192
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,740
It's too boring to talk.

193
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,140
With this bad we

194
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,620
will never find peace.

195
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,220
Good night.

196
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,860
incidents and rogue movies

197
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I understand that you're feeling guilty and forgetful.

198
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,660
Xian, you've misunderstood.

199
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,060
If I really cared about Gu Zhao Zhao,

200
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,260
I wouldn't have followed you.

201
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,220
I can see your feelings.

202
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,340
Last night, Jiang Yue gave me the medicine of Cui Qing.

203
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,460
I was so happy that I passed by.

204
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,740
It really helped me to wake up.

205
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,780
Really?

206
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,580
Then it's really in time.

207
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,780
If I lie,

208
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,380
I'll die.

209
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,300
Remember,

210
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,820
I can help you to clear the clouds

211
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,500
and also help you to return to your original form.

212
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,380
Of course.

213
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
Where is Mrs. Qiu going?

214
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
She's probably going to the Jishi Hospital to settle the accounts.

215
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,820
I heard that she went there last night.

216
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,740
That's not right.

217
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
That's not the direction to the Jishi Hospital.

218
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,580
Mrs. Qiu, what do you mean?

219
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,180
I've known about your feelings.

220
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,060
I've come to your mansion to make a bet.

221
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,220
A bet?

222
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,940
You're using the power of a concubine.

223
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,900
In my eyes,

224
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,420
I don't see a difference between a noble woman and a noble woman.

225
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,140
You've always been a womanizer.

226
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,060
So what if you're a concubine?

227
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,420
How can you judge a woman by her status?

228
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,740
Come with me to my mansion.

229
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,740
We'll serve you as a concubine together in the future.

230
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,740
Wait.

231
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm the legitimate daughter of the mansion.

232
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,420
I won't serve you as a concubine.

233
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,500
Guards.

234
00:13:59,620 --> 00:13:59,900
Yes.

235
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,620
Send the guest out.

236
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,100
Yes.

237
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,940
Everyone knows that I'm here to serve you.

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,660
Minister Jiang thinks that

239
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
besides serving you,

240
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,140
can you still get married?

241
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,740
You're threatening me.

242
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,180
Since you've done something wrong,

243
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,820
you should take the responsibility.

244
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,740
If I leave,

245
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,460
you'll lose the chance to be a concubine.

246
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,100
Even if I'm married,

247
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,820
I can only be a concubine.

248
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,220
Lady Jiang.

249
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,020
Let me send you the medicine.

250
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,180
정말喜歡拉花

251
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,480
What a everyone.

252
00:14:59,660 --> 00:14:59,680
Why do you always win?

253
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,020
what a everyone.

254
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,500
What a everyone.

255
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,880
What a everyone.

256
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,380
Why did you beat her so much?

257
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,420
Are you afraid of destroying your name?

258
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,540
So 7th rank to Death is your number one priority?

259
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,940
Please stop it.

260
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,300
Not everybody will know this now.

261
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
But it's so crowded.

262
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,500
How can I face the people?

263
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,540
People are not short-lived.

264
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,340
If you can be as pure as the mirror,

265
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,540
no one can hurt you.

266
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,700
No one can hurt me?

267
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,900
You are so logical.

268
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,660
Last night,

269
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,900
you sneaked into the room

270
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,660
and stayed there alone

271
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,780
in my husband's coma.

272
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,340
It's a pity that

273
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,940
you can't even be a concubine

274
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,860
if you want to enter our family.

275
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,780
You can't.

276
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,220
Ji Yunzhao is the future mistress of our mansion.

277
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
It's not a problem for you to

278
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,500
take care of her marriage.

279
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
Mrs. Qiu,

280
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,220
you are a woman.

281
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,620
Why do you have to force other women

282
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
to marry you?

283
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,580
If you do something too insolently,

284
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,740
you need to know how to act after you realize it.
