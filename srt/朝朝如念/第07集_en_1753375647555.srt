00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I can't kill you because of my old feelings.

4
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
I told you to leave the capital and never come back.

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,760
But you came back to me.

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,880
You are so bold.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
Mrs. Qiu.

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
These years,

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I told you about the princess'

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,760
words and habits.

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
And I blocked the disaster for you.

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
I came to remind you

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
to keep your promise.

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
You said...

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,440
As long as...

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,720
Shut up.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,680
I will keep you rich and beautiful.

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
I have prepared the carriage.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,440
You will leave the capital tonight.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Mrs. Qiu is so anxious.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Is she guilty of being a thief?

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,600
You mean I...

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
A thief?

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,480
Mrs. Ji thought you were the one who

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
poisoned the embroidery.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,840
And you wanted to kill the princess.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,480
If I want to testify for her,

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know how much she will pay me.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,280
Just tell me.

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,040
How much do you want?

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,920
If I want to leave the capital,

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
you should prepare a house

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
where I live.

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
If you want a house,

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
you should hire three or five servants

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
to clean up the house.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,360
If you want servants,

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,240
you should have a lot of money.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,080
In exchange, I will tell you

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
I am not patient enough.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,240
I don't even have

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
half a box of kung fu.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,880
What's wrong?

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
My dear.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
The King's Mansion

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,360
Steamed gourd.

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
What's the matter?

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,640
You are awake?

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,920
I am awake.

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
I am tired.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
Tell me a joke.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
Have you eaten lotus root?

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,680
I fried it with oil.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,280
It tastes good.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Do you know how it came?

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
No.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
How?

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,560
Long time ago,

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,800
Nezha offended the dragon king

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
and committed suicide.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
He made lotus root with real people

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
to make his body.

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,600
The King of Meat grilled it with the firewood

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
to make the meat soup.

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
He gave it to his father,

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Zhou Wenwang.

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,960
Today,

68
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
the firewood and Nezha

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,080
are in the sky.

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
They are a team.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
They become a couple.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
I don't want to eat lotus root.

73
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,680
I have a story about lotus root.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Okay.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Let's talk about something serious.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,680
What's your plan?

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
I will go to Suizhou.

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,880
Suizhou is in heavy rain and flood.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Where are you going?

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
My father was killed by the rebels.

81
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
He was killed in an emergency.

82
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,200
He was killed by a thousand people.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,880
I will go to collect the body.

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
I can't find a witness.

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
His name is Wang Bowei.

86
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
I suspect he knows the truth.

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
I have been looking for him for years.

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
But I couldn't find him.

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
But recently,

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,920
I received a secret message.

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,520
He is in Suizhou?

92
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
He has been hidden for long.

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
He should be killed.

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
If you want to go to Suizhou,

95
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
you have to show yourself.

96
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,160
The disaster relief?

97
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
Suizhou has many county counties.

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,600
The flood is so severe.

99
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,000
People are in need of food and shelter.

100
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
The people's lives are in danger.

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,480
Please send someone to help.

102
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
Three years ago,

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
I sent Song Hongjian to help.

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
In less than half a month,

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
he committed suicide.

106
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,720
He only left a confession letter.

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,640
The flood in Suizhou is unimaginable.

108
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,760
Minister Jiang,

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
in your opinion,

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
who can take the responsibility?

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
Zhou Junlan is in the court now.

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
He is a loyal man.

113
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I'm afraid his confession

114
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
is already his responsibility.

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
But...

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
The water is slow, the fish is slow.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,280
The moon is slow, the moon is slow.

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,920
He is young and powerful.

119
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,480
He will make His Majesty worry.

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,760
Are you not feeling well?

121
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm just thinking,

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
if you want to go to Suizhou,

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,640
I will go with you.

124
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,560
Why?

125
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
Suizhou had a minister die before.

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm a little worried that you will go alone.

127
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Thank you.

128
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
For what?

129
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,720
You are loyal and intelligent.

130
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,200
You don't mind my loss of power.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm sorry for your hasty action.

132
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
You always help me.

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
You are right.

134
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,600
You are too kind.

135
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,200
I did this

136
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,680
to stop you from being jealous.

137
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm glad to hear that.

138
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,080
Junlan.

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,840
The past is not to be traced.

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,800
Why repeat it?

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
You just need to remember

142
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
that I helped you get what you wanted.

143
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
I didn't do it for you.

144
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,800
You did it for me.

145
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
I was wrong.

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,320
Xian.

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
Isn't this the gift you gave to Xianyang?

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Yes.

149
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,960
He has returned.

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080
Why?

151
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Maybe he is afraid of my teacher

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,600
because of Ji Yunzhao.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Don't you care?

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,840
You said he had the late emperor's edict.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
Maybe he can help us in the future.

156
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
Why are you laughing?

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,280
I can't laugh.

158
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,080
You killed the maid of Qingyang an hour ago.

159
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,520
I helped you.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
You are not afraid of the east window.

161
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
You are not afraid of the ghost.

162
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,920
You can still laugh.

163
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
My good husband.

164
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
I know you well.

165
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,920
The assistant minister of the court

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,920
is not afraid of the disaster

167
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,600
because of a crow's life.

168
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
You are just afraid

169
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,960
Pei Yan will take your post.

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,640
His Majesty is afraid of my power.

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,880
But the disaster in Suizhou is urgent.

172
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,400
There is no one in the court.

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,240
He should only ask me to go.

174
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,920
But he killed Pei Yan.

175
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,760
You can't live a good life.

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
Tomorrow,

177
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,040
who can go to Suizhou with Pei Yan?

178
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,040
I can understand the future.

179
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,280
But the future I know is in the heaven.

180
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
The heaven?

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,160
Why?

182
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
Butterfly effect.

183
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
What do you mean?

184
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,560
A butterfly's wings are shaking.

185
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
It may cause a storm

186
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
a thousand miles away.

187
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,160
A slight change

188
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,680
will make everything

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
unimaginable.

190
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,960
Who changed?

191
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,080
Gu Zhao Zhao.

192
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,880
Gu Zhao Zhao.

193
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I am the butterfly.

194
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,000
It is the wind storm

195
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
I made.

196
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,040
Enough. Stop laughing.

197
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
You are commanding me.

198
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,440
I just...

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Laugh.

200
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,760
Qian.

201
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,680
Laugh until I am satisfied.

202
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
You want me to teach you everything?

203
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
Do you want me to teach you to laugh?

204
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,000
Kneel down.

205
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:40,960
Cute.

206
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,880
Gimme.

207
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Open your eyes.

208
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,120
You mentioned just now

209
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,040
you are a dog who has lost a family.

210
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,960
What about the contdinance by original master?

211
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm afraid I can't help you

212
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
How about

213
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
we work together?

214
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Work together?

215
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
What can you give me?

216
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Pei Yan

217
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
as long as we work together

218
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
I will help you achieve your dream

219
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
and live a peaceful life

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Interesting

221
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
I want to go to Suizhou

222
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
but there is no way

223
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
to be a good person

224
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
But Minister Jiang won't recommend Zhou Junlan

225
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Because of this

226
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
His Majesty will suspect that he is colluding with the city

227
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
He won't deny it

228
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Because of this, His Majesty will suspect that he is a traitor

229
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
He will only recommend those

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
who are the lowest in the court

231
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
But you are one of them

232
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
What's more

233
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Minister Jiang's daughter Jiang Yue

234
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
owes me a favor

235
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
She recommended me

236
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
His Majesty may not use me

237
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
My Lord

238
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
His Majesty wants you to come to the palace tomorrow

239
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
As long as I can face the victory

240
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
I will have a chance

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Who gives him a chance?

242
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Call the secretary of the central office

243
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Zhou Junlan

244
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Xuan Yinghong, Pei Yan

245
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
to come

246
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I am here

247
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Greetings, Your Majesty

248
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
As long as I can face the victory

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I will have a chance

250
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Who gives him a chance?

251
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Prince

252
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Prince

253
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
What do you want?

254
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:23,720
I help you to be a

255
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Why?

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
To ascend the sky

257
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
To ascend the sky

258
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Who?

259
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Arise

260
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Father, it's him

261
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
He is my savior

262
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Give him to him

263
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Why?

264
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
You are angry

265
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
So cute

266
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Why?

267
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Always be the White Night

268
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Good

269
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Suizhou is a dragon lake

270
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
This trip will never go back

271
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
never go back

272
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,480
zet

273
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,340
with you

274
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
What are you laughing at?

275
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Ji Yunzhao

276
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
What's wrong?

277
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Why is he following us?

278
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
He's a skilled doctor

279
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
He can solve the problem at critical moments

280
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
How about this?

281
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
It's boring to work so hard

282
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Pei Yan

283
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Are you still laughing?

284
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm not laughing

285
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm just laughing

286
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Are you still laughing?

287
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
He?

288
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
He's laughing?

289
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Dr. Ji

290
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Do you like lotus root?

291
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Yes

292
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Oh, I brought some

293
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Here, Yunzhao

294
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Eat it while it's hot

295
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm not eating

296
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I'll eat it then

297
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
By the way

298
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
What joke are you going to tell me?

299
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
It's said that long ago

300
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Nezha offended Dragon King

301
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
and committed suicide

302
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I don't want lotus root anymore

303
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
dealing

304
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Master

305
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Chamberlain learning

306
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
What to do

307
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,580
No matter how bad you're

308
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
My lord

309
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Your tip is a bit misaligned

310
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Places that you are not well 두려

311
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
Thank you

312
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
My lord

313
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
If there is anything to do

314
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Just order Yuan to do it

315
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,660
I heard that from Her Highness the Queen.

316
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,700
Please.

My Lord!

332
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Yunzhao! You can't go in!

333
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Move!

334
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
A police officer has died recently!

335
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
You're also here to help?

336
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Let me go!

337
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
No, My Lord!

338
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Yunzhao!

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
My Lord!
