00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,440
This is the prescription I carefully prepared.

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,840
You should take it once a day and recover in three days.

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,040
I will reward you. Thank you, Your Highness.

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Xian'er, you are so stubborn.

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,560
You can even hang a oil pot.

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,560
The cake is cold. I can't drink the tea.

9
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
It's so cold.

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Let's play the game.

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,440
Okay.

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,560
Give me your hand.

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Wait a minute, Xian'er.

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,080
Hand.

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Xian'er, listen to me.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,280
Listen to you?

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
It's you...

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,560
who listens to me.

19
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
Hand.

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,600
Good.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,360
Mixed with education and rifle adult,

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,400
aodo- normalization,

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
audo- should unified with culture.

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
talks after work properly

25
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,760
Give her an starred left hand

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
I can identify him from a Aiynnم

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
Aido- normalization

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,520
hard for this to be easy to recognize

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,020
Pixian,

30
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,220
I can only get rid of it after taking the antidote.

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,620
Why are you laughing so hard?

32
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,220
I like it.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Zhao Zhao, after we parted,

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,020
I've prepared a good meal for you.

35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,420
I'll go.

36
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,420
Sister Ji Yang,

37
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,620
I brought this incense from Jiangnan.

38
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,420
How do you like it?

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,420
It's a rare incense from the Gui family.

40
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm so nice to you.

41
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,820
No need to talk about it.

42
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
Princess, it's almost time.

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
Let's get ready to take the antidote.

44
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,420
Okay.

45
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,020
Qingyang, Qingyang, my good sister.

46
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,420
The money I lost yesterday, no need to talk about it.

47
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,820
Who wants to ask for money from you?

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,220
I'll help you to take the antidote, okay?

49
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,420
No.

50
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,020
I'll ask my husband to introduce you to some good colleagues.

51
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,420
Okay.

52
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,620
Mrs. Qiu,

53
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,820
this is not a child's play. You can't make a fuss.

54
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
You can teach me.

55
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Princess Qingyang.

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,820
You're so good at medicine.

57
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,420
I'm relieved to have you here.

58
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,220
Let's start.

59
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,620
After we take the antidote,

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,620
we can take it off.

61
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,020
I'll go get it.

62
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't be so anxious.

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,780
I'm fine.

64
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,020
Sister, your face.

65
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
My face?

66
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,820
Why do you have so many acnes?

67
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,420
It wasn't like this yesterday.

68
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,020
My face is peeling off.

69
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,220
Peeling off because...

70
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,620
My hand.

71
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,780
Make him pay for the낆

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,680
How's the konkrown � arranged?

73
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,660
Why is Her Highness taken to the palace?

74
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Because we need to deal with avec

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,980
Lady Qin's concocted manta swimming

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,140
they had no memories

77
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,640
who was this person

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm sure

79
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,320
Her Highness

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,980
LOVE EDUCATION

81
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,940
WHERE DO YOU THINK THE DRUG SHOULD BE?

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,320
NO waveform

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,920
you're different in character

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,620
KINGDONG

85
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,360
you are beautiful

86
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,780
I pretty the same

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
thousand years later

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,860
and still

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,660
What I've been asking for is only to be luxurious and rich.

90
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,700
But being able to be rich and happy,

91
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,260
is far less than one thing that makes me happy.

92
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,460
Guess what it is.

93
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,260
Protecting the evils without lacking.

94
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,460
Shining eyes.

95
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,260
I like to peel your skin the most.

96
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,060
Tear out your shoulder.

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,660
Cut your bones.

98
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,460
Look at you again and again.

99
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,060
Climb up.

100
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,060
Tonight, I'll take Princess Qingyang to the prison.

101
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,260
I'll also get you something.

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,860
My life?

103
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,260
It's your broken spine.

104
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,260
I'll take you to the prison.

105
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,660
I'll take you to the prison.

106
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,260
I'll take you to the prison.

107
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,660
I'll take you to the prison.

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,060
I'll take you to the prison.

109
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,660
I'll take you to the prison.

110
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,260
I'll take you to the prison.

111
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll take you to the prison.

112
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,260
I'll take you to the prison.

113
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,660
I'll take you to the prison.

114
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,260
I'll take you to the prison.

115
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,860
I'll take you to the prison.

116
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,660
I'll take you to the prison.

117
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,660
I'll take you to the prison.

118
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,660
I didn't wear it up.

119
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
The back of your neck is struggle too?

120
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,460
Roast melts fire.

121
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,660
Roasted brought back my past.

122
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,260
Roasted This is my escape.

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,060
Bake my marks.

124
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,860
What a bad guy.

125
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,500
Little lady,

127
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,980
do you know where Doctor Ji is locked up?

128
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,620
Do I look like a little lady?

129
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,940
Of course.

130
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,340
She's a beautiful little lady.

131
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,580
But my face...

132
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
It's not ugly.

133
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,940
They look at it with their eyes.

134
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,340
I look at it with my heart.

135
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,700
If she doesn't find out the truth

136
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,300
like Princess Qingyang,

137
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
she'll be a bad woman

138
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,380
if she catches a doctor who has been injured.

139
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
That man deliberately ruined her face.

140
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm a close friend of Doctor Ji.

141
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,180
I know her personality.

142
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,900
She's definitely not a bad woman.

143
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,100
Are you going to the prison now?

144
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,060
Yes.

145
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,980
She's in a critical condition.

146
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,060
I'm afraid that she'll be too hard on herself.

147
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,660
She can't stand it.

148
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,300
Princess Qingyang is not that heartless.

149
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,140
That's not good.

150
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,420
Since you and Lady Ji are from the same family,

151
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,420
will you be able to face her?

152
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,060
It's a matter of life and death.

153
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,300
You want me to treat your face now?

154
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm the most favored maid of Princess Qingyang.

155
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,060
You've treated my face.

156
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,020
I'll go to the princess and beg for mercy.

157
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,900
Let her go.

158
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,220
You can really endure it.

159
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,700
But you can do better.

160
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,540
As you wish.

161
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,140
Or else I'll have no sister.

162
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,060
Sister Qingyang,

163
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,620
I've foamed for you now. Are you happy?

164
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,300
A swordsman cured my face

165
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,860
as you said.

166
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,580
He said that my face has bumpy skin

167
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,780
because your ointment has the effect of transferring the skin.

168
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,180
Before I find this out,

170
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,820
I asked you to take the torture of skin rejuvenation.

171
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,900
I'll stick to this until the end.

172
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,180
I'm sorry for your loss

173
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,940
Thank you, Your Highness

174
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,980
Lady Jin, please go back

175
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,420
No

176
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,740
I have someone else to help

177
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,740
Who?

178
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,180
The real murderer

179
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,380
You suspect me?

180
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,220
I was under Lady Jin's guidance

181
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,340
to fetch the medicine for Sister Qingyang

182
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,620
Yes, Lady Jin

183
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,300
You checked everything I used that day

184
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,740
What if he hid the poison in the sleeve?

185
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,940
The sleeve?

186
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,580
He put the poison on the sleeve first

187
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,780
After washing his hands

188
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,620
and then touched your face

189
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,780
I tried to check it again

190
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,660
but there was no poison in the sleeve

191
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,460
So I didn't find anything suspicious

192
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Interesting

193
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,740
Do you have any evidence?

194
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,020
Mrs. Qiu

195
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,100
Where is the red pillow?

196
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,220
It's fine now

197
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,220
Really?

198
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,500
Lady Jin, you're a doctor

199
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,300
You should know that everyone has a different body

200
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,100
Maybe I'm getting better

201
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
You suspect me

202
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,260
You should give me a good evidence

203
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,740
Besides, Sister Qingyang and I are like sisters

204
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,780
Why should I harm her?

205
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,460
Can I check your sleeve?

206
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
I'm the wife of the secretary of the Central Office

207
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,740
Why should I let you, a doctor, check it?

208
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,820
I don't dare

209
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,980
Hurry up

210
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,500
Playing hide-and-scenes

211
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,900
It's me

212
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,700
Lanzhi

213
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,660
Why?

214
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:35,580
Your Highness is

215
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,460
Take her off

216
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,060
I won't let you do it

217
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,980
Don't do such foolish things

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,860
Your Highness

219
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,500
Go

220
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:44,860
Your Highness

221
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,220
Your Highness

222
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,100
It seems that I misunderstood Madam Qiu.

223
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,700
Since you've found the real culprit, I'll take my leave.

224
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,900
Lady Jin, please wait.

225
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Sister Qingyang is unwell.

226
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,700
We are both very anxious.

227
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,300
It's inevitable that we might misunderstand each other.

228
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,900
I'm asking Your Highness to be my witness.

229
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I'll drink this wine with Lady Jin.

230
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,900
I'll use this to make a jade bracelet.

231
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Is that okay?

232
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,100
Are you afraid that this wine is poisonous?

233
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,900
It seems that Lady Jin is unwilling to forgive me.

234
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,300
That's right.

235
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
I'm unwilling.

236
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,100
The dry air is getting stronger.

237
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
The heart is not beating.

238
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,700
Your old disease has returned.

239
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,300
We are waiting for you to release the poison.

240
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,700
Even though you are still alive,

241
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,100
you are still not a good person.

242
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,900
I'm afraid that you might not be able to do anything.

243
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,100
I'm afraid that you might not be able to do anything.

244
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
I'm afraid that you might not be able to do anything.

245
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Even though you are still alive,

246
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,300
you still need to be careful and take care of someone.

247
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
This guy is dizzy.

248
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,900
Here, take this. The door is over there.

249
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,700
Go play by yourself.

250
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm clumsy.

251
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
I'll ask Doctor Ji to go out and make the medicine.

252
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
As for the blood...

253
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:29,900
The black magicク

254
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I can't open my mouth without your help.

255
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
This hair band is enough.

256
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
I've been here all the time.

257
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
In this case,

258
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,900
I can use the chemical treatment to cure her dizzying disease.

259
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Master, you go out first.

260
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
I go out?

261
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Doctor Ji, the door is there.

262
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Go play.

263
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Close your eyes.

264
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Who is it?

265
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,900
It's just her yearning.

266
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Love is eternal.

267
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,900
The shadow is still there.

268
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Let's make a pair of eyes.

269
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Butterfly is real.

270
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Boiling water and old moon.

271
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Even if we can't be together forever,

272
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:03,900
I will give you my heart.

273
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Let go of the shackles of this whole life.

274
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm the only one left.

275
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
I'll break through all obstacles.

276
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
They are all lies.

277
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,900
The night sky has already been covered by the light in my heart.

278
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
When I'm with you, the sky is bright and the wind is strong.

279
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Who knows who will be the one to decide the fate?

280
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
The past is determined.

281
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,900
The memory is so deep that it's hard to get rid of it.

282
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,900
I just believe that I will never fall.
