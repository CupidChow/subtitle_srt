The Long Ballad

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,440
Father.

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,880
Mother.

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,680
Stay here.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
I'll go find them.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,640
Uncle Zhi.

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,880
Be careful.

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Father.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,760
Mother.

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
Long time no see.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,880
It's you.

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,440
It's you, right?

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,480
It's me.

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,640
Zhao Zhao.

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
I miss you so much.

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,600
I want to kill you.

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,040
I want to kill you.

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
Is this the dream you want the most?

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Okay.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,360
Then I'll help you

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,240
get what you want.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,800
Wait.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,160
Don't leave your son.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I will kill you.

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,920
Don't make such a faced look at me.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
I hate you.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
raiser.

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,640
That's right.

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
Why didn't you kill me?

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
If I kill you now,

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,760
it won't be fun anymore.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,960
Just for fun?

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,600
Guess.

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Do you have any deep hatred

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,080
with our Gu family?

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,560
Guess again.

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,640
That's for Zhou Junlan.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,240
Just for a man,

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,800
you are forced to a desperate situation.

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,880
This is the funniest reason

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
I've ever heard in my life.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,640
Why?

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,320
Why on earth?

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,720
I don't even have half a box of patience.

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,720
But for your land,

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,560
I've waited for seven days.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,360
But you?

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,800
You were deceived by the hope in front of you.

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
You're willing to end your life here.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
How dare you?

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Do you remember what I said to you

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
in the Princess Manor that day?

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,880
I like to

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,720
peel your skin,

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,000
pull out your tendons,

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
and break your bones.

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,480
You have to climb up

59
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,000
again and again.

60
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,520
I just need to move my fingers

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,760
and I can easily kill you.

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,080
But I won't.

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
I want you to smile at me

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
and give everyone

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
a performance that is unparalleled,

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
a high-profile performance that will shock people.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
Come on.

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
Smile at me.

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Revenge?

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
You're a lunatic!

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,240
Yunzhao!

72
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Pei Yan!

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
Don't let me down

74
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
when we meet again.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,080
Yunzhao!

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,880
Pei Yan!

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,400
Pei Yan!

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Pei Yan!

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Yunzhao!

80
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Pei Yan!

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
Are you okay?

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,400
My parents and Uncle Shi are inside.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
Please save them, Pei Yan.

84
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,880
Yunzhao!

85
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
Dad!

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
Mom!

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,760
Uncle Shi!

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
Mom!

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,040
The wind blows and the wind dies.

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,680
The wind blows and the wind dies.

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
Are you okay, Uncle Shi?

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm fine.

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,760
Are you hungry?

94
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,840
I'm hungry.

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
Are you thirsty?

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
Drink some water.

97
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,120
I can't save the birds.

98
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320
The medicine in the valley is burnt out.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We'll go to the clinic.

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
There's medicine in the clinic.

101
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
We'll be in the capital soon.

102
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,640
We'll be cured.

103
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,440
Got it?

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,240
Forget it.

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,760
What do you mean?

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
I finally saved you.

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,000
How can I forget it?

108
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,240
Yunzhao, I want to see him.

109
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,160
I know I'm dying.

110
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,280
But I haven't sent the letter out yet.

111
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay.

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,680
See you then.

113
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay.

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,920
He won't come.

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,040
He will.

116
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,400
He won't come.

117
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,640
He will.

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,920
Your Highness.

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Your Highness, he's here.

120
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
He's here? Really?

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,200
But...

122
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
But he...

123
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
But what's wrong with him?

124
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,840
He's Ji Xiao.

125
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,560
What's wrong with him?

126
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,600
Doctor Xuan, go.

127
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,480
Your Highness, they're drug addicts.

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,000
If the palace finds out, we'll...

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Save me. I'm having a sudden illness.

130
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Go.

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
How did you know so much about this'sれて?

132
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Let's go and check inside.

133
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,080
Go.

134
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
Go.

135
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,440
My Lady.

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Is this nice?

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
The everyone of the Mansion was Jillian's concubine.

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
And she had the light Welcome reception.

139
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,480
Very nice.

140
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,880
Because I'm wearing the most beautiful clothes.

141
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
You can do whatever you want me to do.

142
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,960
You are a man of your word.

143
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
You are a man of your word.

144
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
You want a child, right?

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
Yes, we want a child.

146
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
I don't care if I'm fat or ugly.

147
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,200
As long as you let my father go, please.

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
You are the minister's daughter.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,520
How can you do this?

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
Come on.

151
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
Put the vase,

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,320
the bowl,

153
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,200
and the hairpin in her room away.

154
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,880
Watch the door.

155
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,440
Let my father go.

156
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
Don't let her step out.

157
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes.

158
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,960
Please.

159
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm begging you.

160
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,600
Please let my father go.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,200
Qiu Junlan.

162
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Come back.

163
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
Don't kill my father.

164
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm begging you.

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,080
How is she?

166
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
I'm afraid I can't hold on for long.

168
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,960
You can't cure her.

169
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
I'll let you die with me.

170
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
Your Highness.

171
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
Even if you kill my whole family,

172
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,880
you can't save her.

173
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,400
Get out.

174
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,160
Yes.

175
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,920
Jin Yuzheng.

176
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
You know how to cure her, right?

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,520
You can think of a way to save her, right?

178
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,800
I...

179
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Right?

180
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Please.

181
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,920
Sanyue.

182
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Sanyue.

183
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,960
Jinxiu, listen.

184
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm not a maid.

185
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm the princess.

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
The emperor's sister.

187
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
I can think of a way to cure you.

188
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,080
You just told me that?

189
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,200
I didn't mean to lie to you.

191
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,520
Everyone likes me

192
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,200
because I'm Princess Qingyang.

193
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
Only you are different.

194
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:51,320
I'm sorry to play with you and die after I met you.

195
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm so painful.

196
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,360
Please help me.

197
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
What do you want me to do?

198
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,960
You tell me.

199
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,000
Please help me.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I...

201
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Senior.

202
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,760
I'm begging you.

203
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,040
I'm in too much pain.

204
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Guards.

205
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,880
Qi Xue has gathered the soup.

206
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Are you crazy?

207
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,560
Do you want to watch her die?

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm not.

209
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm not.

210
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Yunzhao.

211
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Wei Young.

212
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Wei Young.

213
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Wei Young, help me.

214
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Calm down.

215
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Help me stop them.

216
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Yunzhao.

217
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Help me stop them.

218
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Yunzhao.

219
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Yunzhao.

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Do you want to watch Ji Xiao die?

221
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I don't.

222
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,480
I want her to die happily.

223
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,960
She's better than her painful words.

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Uncle Shen.

225
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
You can leave now.

226
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I don't want to.

227
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I don't want to.

228
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Uncle Shen.

229
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Uncle Shen.

230
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Uncle Shen.

231
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
This bowl is a poison that can numb your nerves.

232
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
It can only give you half a scent of poison.

233
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
You won't feel so painful if you keep drinking it.

234
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I know.

235
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
But can you stop drinking it?

236
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Can you stay with me for a while?

237
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm in too much pain.

239
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Can you feed me?

240
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Don't look at me.

242
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
You said you like handsome guys.

243
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
You're handsome and handsome.

244
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,920
You're a handsome guy.

245
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
You're lying.

246
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm so ugly now.

247
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
The world is ugly.

248
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Others look at it with their eyes.

249
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I look at it with my heart.

250
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
In my opinion,

251
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
you're handsome more than all handsome guys in the world.

252
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
You're handsome a hundred times more handsome than all handsome guys in the world.

253
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
A thousand times more handsome than all handsome guys in the world.

254
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Isn't that what I said?

255
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm a noble person.

256
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
We're married.

257
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
You're a son-in-law.

258
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Since you're a son-in-law,

259
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
yours is mine.

260
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I can say what you said.

261
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Are you proposing to me?

262
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Why are you crying?

263
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,880
I shouldn't be happy.

264
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm not crying.

265
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm just getting angry.

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
I wrote a love letter.

267
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
It should have been for you.

268
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,360
But it rained too hard that day.

269
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I had to stay in the city.

270
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Actually,

271
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,360
the rain was my excuse.

272
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm sorry to give it to you.

273
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
You're embarrassed now.

274
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Silly.

275
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Read it for me.

276
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Can you read it for me?

277
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Can you read it for me?

278
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Okay?

279
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,360
I can't be with you anymore.

280
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm so excited.

281
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Do you remember the wind blowing me?

282
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
I want to tell you

283
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
my wish.

284
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
The fingertips I touch

285
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
and the sweat on my forehead

286
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,840
are all shining.

287
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,320
They're all saying this.

288
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Jinxiao,

289
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,320
can you give me more?

290
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
I beg you.

291
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Give me more.

292
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Jinxiao.

293
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,320
Jinxiao.

294
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Jinxiao.

295
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Jinxiao.

296
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Jinxiao.

297
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Jinxiao.

298
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Jinxiao.

299
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Jinxiao.

300
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Jinxiao.

301
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Jinxiao.

302
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Jinxiao.

303
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Jinxiao.

304
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Jinxiao.

305
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Jinxiao.

306
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Jinxiao.

307
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Jinxiao.
