The Long Ballad

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Madam, Minister Jiang has something important to discuss with Mr. Zhou.

4
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Isn't it not good for us to go and find them now?

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,720
Is Minister Jiang inside? Is he done with his work?

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,440
Replying to Madam, Minister Jiang has just left.

7
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,920
Why did Father come and leave without saying anything?

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,960
Maybe he has something urgent.

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Old man, I think Minister Jiang's words are not unfounded.

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,240
Right now is the time when the rebels are the weakest.

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
Why don't you just go after them and kill them all?

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,600
His Majesty will definitely be very angry.

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,080
What do you know?

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,280
Right now, there are no people in the court.

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,520
If I destroy them all, will he still use me?

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,040
But if His Majesty wants to appoint Minister Jiang...

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,520
Then how will the old lord die?

18
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
I'll let him die.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
So what if he uses my power?

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,800
If he's named Jiang, who else can take the responsibility?

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,920
But Minister Jiang is very important.

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm afraid that he won't be able to be buried with him.

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,600
His daughter is in my hands.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
The father and daughter will die together.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,720
Guess how he will choose?

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Father.

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,360
This lady.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
This is not a place for you to come.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,040
I want to see Consort Song.

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,840
I advise you to leave.

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
Consort Song, get out!

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Zhao Yan!

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Do you still remember who caused your family to be destroyed?

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Aren't you on their side?

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,840
Don't be ungrateful.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
I did my best to protect your father.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,800
But I was stopped by the evil.

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,440
But now, the Marquis of Xuanyin has become a fugitive.

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,200
He and Ji Yunzhao escaped to the Medicine King Valley overnight.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,960
This is the best time for you to take revenge.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,920
If you want to take revenge, I can lead the way for you.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,120
The late emperor wanted to live forever.

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,040
Even he didn't know where the Medicine King Valley was.

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,440
Not to mention you are just a woman.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,760
I know everything.

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,840
How can I trust you?

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,360
The paper circle in Songru Yard is made of swallow's urine.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,160
There is a hole on it that you accidentally broke.

49
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,560
You fixed it later.

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,160
How did you know?

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,800
Knowing is knowing.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,960
For example, I know that you are not angry.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,240
You know where they escaped to.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,360
You know how you can take revenge.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,880
What do you want me to do?

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,520
I didn't expect that I would be able to enjoy the medicine that you made.

57
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,920
Yes.

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,720
So you must get better soon.

59
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
Okay.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,480
When I'm better, I will repay you.

61
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,600
How?

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,900
Yunche, rest for a while.

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,680
I'll go to wash the pill bowl so as not to let it condition and need to speak again.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,160
That is still not enough, can't you handle it for me?

65
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,800
I want to hear from your parents.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,460
Fine, sorry.

67
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,880
I'll check on my parents for you.

68
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
You should have a good rest.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,680
I'll go wash the pills.

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,280
In case Ji Xiao will be noisy again.

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Xian.

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,640
Why are you here?

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,640
You've been gone for over a month.

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,200
I miss you.

75
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
You said you miss me?

76
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
You're my godmother.

77
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,640
Of course I miss you.

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
I made this for you.

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,800
Here.

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,480
I brought you this tea.

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,280
It's called Yellow Cool Dream.

82
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,680
It's said that the tea made with it

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
tastes very good.

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,080
People who drink it

85
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,760
will think it's good for your body.

86
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
It's like a dream.

87
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,840
Try it.

88
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:17,680
(#4 ag Seventeen没事i polit Blues exclusion case Camera

89
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,080
Will you choose

90
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,960
I made you some medicine.

91
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,320
Do you want to drink it?

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,560
Give it to me.

93
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay.

94
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,560
What's wrong?

95
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,480
Nothing.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,600
I...

97
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
I'm looking at Sister Qiu.

98
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,640
What's wrong?

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,640
Nothing.

100
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm looking at Sister Qiu.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
I don't know where she went these days.

102
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,320
There are only you and me left in the family.

103
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Is it bad?

104
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
Of course it's good.

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,640
Yue'er.

106
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
We can start over.

107
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,400
Okay.

108
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,600
Husband.

109
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
I'll give you some medicine.

110
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,440
It's not good if it gets cold.

111
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Uncle...

112
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,500
You're looking at me?

113
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,440
Are you looking at Xin LinkedIn?

114
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,440
No.

115
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
I was not.

116
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,560
Lucky for me.

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
Find someone else I know.

118
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,240
What's wrong?

119
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,160
Why aren't you drinking?

120
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Does drinking poison you?

121
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,360
How did you know?

122
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,120
One mistake.

123
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,560
Two mistakes.

124
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
I have never told you about this.

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
You are my biological daughter.

126
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I was a woman from a good family.

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I was kidnapped by bandits.

128
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I wanted to survive.

129
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I had to seal off their wings.

130
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,640
So I had you.

131
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
But Hou You Shang saved me.

134
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I fell in love with that merchant.

135
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,640
But I was afraid that he would think I was a bad person.

136
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
So I threw you...

137
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I threw you in the mountain.

138
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
I went back to the capital with him.

139
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,640
I was Gu Zhao Zhao's concubine.

140
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Gu Zhao Zhao's birth mother died in a hard time.

141
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
When you saw her,

142
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
she was only three years old.

143
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,640
I thought you were her biological daughter.

144
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,640
You lived a hard life like this.

145
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Until you saw me in the slave market.

146
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
You recognized my birthmark.

147
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
You felt guilty.

148
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
She didn't dare to save me.

149
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
So you set up a trap.

150
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Gu Zhao Zhao felt sorry for me.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
You bought me off.

152
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
You made me his maid.

153
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
You know it all.

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I'll never forget it.

155
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,640
I came here to set fire to the valley.

156
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I forced Ji Yun Zhao to go back to the capital.

157
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,640
I set up a great path for her.

158
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
It took me half an hour.

159
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,640
It's going to be a fire.

160
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm giving you a big show.

161
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
It's a good laugh.

162
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
You laughed.

163
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
I laughed.

164
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Because I had a good life.

165
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Everything has a return.

166
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Like a dream bubble.

167
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Like a dewdrop.

168
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I should be like a corpse.

169
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
It's you.

170
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
What do you want?

171
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
I want you to taste it.

172
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
The taste of life and death.

173
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
What do you mean?

174
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
You want to kill me?

175
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
I want to kill you.

176
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I want to kill you.

177
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I want to kill you.

178
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I want to kill you.

179
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Yun Zhao.

180
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Who knows who has been defeated by the wind?

181
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
The past is gone.

182
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
The memories are gone.

183
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
I just want to stay.

184
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I will never fall.
