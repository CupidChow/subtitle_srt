00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
I heard from Ji Xiao that you went to the dungeon.

4
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,840
And I heard from the jade clan that you went to your own mansion.

5
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
You haven't recovered yet.

6
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,480
It's not easy to catch you.

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,200
What are you busy with?

8
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,360
Are you thinking about me?

9
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,160
Why don't you open your eyes?

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,880
Qiu Xian Er has a grudge against you.

11
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Today, you meet him.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,440
I think with your temperament,

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,960
you should be a sword with white knife and a red knife.

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,160
So what?

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm afraid of blood.

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,040
Look at me.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,480
Do you have it?

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
No.

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
He came to me today to ask for my love.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,320
He asked me what I wanted.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,800
I said,

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
I want your life.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,800
I'll give you my life.

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,520
Then,

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,720
give it to me.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Are you satisfied?

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm just a lawyer.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,720
He was scared and ran away.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
I wanted to return it to him.

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,760
I thought about it.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
As long as Zhao Jun Lan is alive,

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,720
it's his life-saving talisman.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,240
I'll remember it for a long time.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,160
What about you?

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,280
Did you find any information about the other half of the painting

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
in Runan?

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,000
Not only did I find the clue,

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,480
I also found out the real murderer behind it.

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,960
Why didn't you believe it in the first place?

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
Now you've a fabricated lie.

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,160
So who's the real murderer?

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,640
You want to report to the Emperor?

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,560
No.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,860
I want him to

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
send also the evidence

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,360
to the Emperor personally.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
Your stress was

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
placed on the private parts of requests

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,200
to the law firm.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
The victims will be finished

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,080
when relatives come to ask for their death.

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,720
As he's hit and killed,

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,880
it is chaos whether he is alive still or not.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,680
The Ottoman Empire

55
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,120
is working on the Teshigahui's debts.

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
The SCHU 샤oper

57
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,320
is consequently on the go.

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,120
Dead if you flee.

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,520
He's spared your life in order to save past time.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,000
It's easier for you now.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,800
Now that you learnt the method,

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,000
you're at the top rank.

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,760
I didn't mean to opine.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
It's just the bandage isЛ too heavy for me.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,040
It's not appropriate to worship.

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,920
It's not på.

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,160
These rude people don't know the importance of the fight.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
But,

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Assistant Minister Zhou, although you are injured,

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
you must not lose your manners.

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
I hope that you will kneel and thank the Great Benevolence.

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
Don't make things difficult for me.

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I thank the Great Benevolence.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Wake up.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
I haven't seen you for a few days.

76
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Why are you so tired?

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I'm tired.

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,320
I haven't seen you for a few days. Why are you so stubborn?

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm already injured like this.

80
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Can't you just let me go?

81
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
You heartless thing.

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Is this heartless?

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,320
To keep you out, I begged so many people,

84
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
and I broke so many of their breaths.

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,320
It's always someone else's fault.

86
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,320
In your eyes, I'm just a dog.

87
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
That's also my dog.

88
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Good.

89
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
When you're recovered,

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
I'll take you out

91
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,320
to let you bite people.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Why?

94
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Isn't it just a matter of getting back to your job?

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
There are many things to do at the officialdom.

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
It's normal to talk about everything.

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
How can His Majesty not know?

98
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,320
He treats others like a stranger.

99
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
He's so ungrateful to me.

100
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
So what if I'm recovering?

101
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,320
It's just a matter of finding a way to get back to the national treasury.

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
You're so old.

103
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
When he's old,

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
he'll be a man

105
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,320
who's always on the night shift.

106
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Zhou Junlan, get out!

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Why is Pei Yan here?

108
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
He's here

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
to help me.

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Do you recognize this?

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
You're a stinky man.

112
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
The one who stepped on the dead

113
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
is a stinky man.

114
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,320
You know it.

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
There are two copies of the city defense map.

116
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
One is in His Majesty's hands.

117
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
The other is in the old marquis's hands.

118
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
The old marquis didn't prevent the map from being stolen.

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,320
They mixed the map with two soldiers

120
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
and destroyed the original paper in their hands.

121
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I've found them.

122
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Zhao Peng, the commander of Suizhou County,

123
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
has been killed.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
General Zhang Zhao of Western Liang

125
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
has been imprisoned.

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
My father was sentenced to betray me.

127
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
I don't believe it.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
I've been searching for the truth for years.

129
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
I only found out the truth

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
when I met Zhang Zhao.

131
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
You're the one

132
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
who is the real culprit.

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
You're the one

134
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
who lied to me

135
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
and framed me.

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Zhang Zhao told you

137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
that the old marquis

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
took two soldiers

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
in front of me

140
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
to tell me how to preserve the map.

141
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
He asked me, the real culprit,

142
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
to report to His Majesty.

143
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I lied to you

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
and framed you.

145
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
It's you.

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
You really believe it?

147
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
What Zhang Zhao said

148
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
was just a rumor.

149
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
How could you guess it so accurately?

150
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
How dare you!

151
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Pei Yan,

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
you're so innocent.

153
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
You've been fooled.

154
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Why didn't you kill me?

155
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I'll take you to the front

156
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
and make a decision for my father.

157
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I'll let the world know

158
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
that my father loved the country.

159
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
In this life,

160
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
I'll be free and happy.

161
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
No.

162
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
You won't.

163
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
What do you mean?

164
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Because you're afraid.

165
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
You've found out

166
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
who made your father die.

167
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
The real culprit.

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
The real culprit.

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
In the past,

170
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
I was loyal to the people.

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
But I didn't have the chance to see you.

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I've been trying to convince you.

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
His Majesty is with Her Majesty.

174
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
You'd better go back.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
The war in Western Liang is not over.

176
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm a man of few words.

177
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
But I've been familiar with the Ming's army.

178
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm willing to make a wish to Her Majesty.

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'll fight with Her Majesty and make a contribution to her.

180
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I'll make a contribution to Her Majesty.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Please tell Her Majesty.

182
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Her Majesty has been away for a long time.

183
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
She's already rested.

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You want me to tell her

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
about this little thing.

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll make her angry.

187
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
You're a court official.

188
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Why don't you

189
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
tell her about it?

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
I've said it.

191
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Western Liang is poor.

192
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
The old marquis is a court official.

193
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
He's enough.

194
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Yes, with the old marquis,

195
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
what's the hurry?

196
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Until I met him.

197
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
You said that if I kill Gu Zhao Zhao

198
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
and marry you,

199
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
I'll make my wish come true.

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
What do you want?

201
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Go to Western Liang and make contributions.

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I'll make a contribution to the people.

203
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:43,680
From the capital to the Huren

204
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
What?

205
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Didn't you see it with your own eyes?

206
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I can see the future.

207
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
As for the letter,

208
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
it's a natural opportunity.

209
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
It can't be leaked.

210
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
You just need to remember two things.

211
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
What is it?

212
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
First, the person who sent the letter

213
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
killed the person who returned to the capital.

214
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Second,

215
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
on the 15th of the month,

216
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
the east wind will be blown.

217
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
You have to give the general Zhang Zhao

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
a clue before you come here.

219
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
If you attack the enemy camp at this time,

220
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
you can win with fire.

221
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
You can win with fire.

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
I wish you a good luck.

223
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
You have to be careful.

224
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Seven days later,

225
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
the Huren defeated the Western Liang army.

226
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
The Fulu who escaped from the enemy camp

227
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
informed the old marquis

228
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
to defeat the rebels.

229
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Because he found the city defense map in the enemy camp,

230
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
I gave Zhang Zhao a clue.

231
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
On the 15th of the month,

232
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
the enemy camp was burned.

233
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Zhang Zhao did return with a good news.

234
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Because of this,

235
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
the emperor has a good reputation for me.

236
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
He ordered me to investigate the old marquis's case.

237
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
The old marquis

238
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
took his two soldiers

239
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
to see me

240
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
for self-proclaimed innocence.

241
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I reported to the emperor as it was.

242
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
The witness and evidence are all here.

243
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
I think...

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
What's the result?

245
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
What's the result?

246
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
The evidence is clear.

247
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
It's a good result.

248
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Then I will

249
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
reward you with it.

250
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
By the way,

251
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
you said just now

252
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
what should be the result of this case?

253
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
The old marquis

254
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
is innocent.

255
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
He has no crime to be pardoned.

256
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Good.

257
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Pass my order.

258
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Arrest general Wei Yuan and his subordinates.

259
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
In ten days,

260
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
they will be hanged on the wall

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
and be cut into pieces.

262
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Yes, your majesty.

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
So the letter is

264
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
I have nothing to do with it.

265
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
It's not difficult to

266
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
make a copy of the city's defense map.

267
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Father is brave and kind.

268
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
He is noble and noble.

269
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
His majesty is too much

270
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
and he is too kind.

271
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
But you?

272
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
You know the truth.

273
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Tell me.

274
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
You always make fun of me.

275
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
You see me

276
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
running around for this.

277
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I have never had any grudges with you.

278
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Why?

279
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Mother,

280
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
did you see that?

281
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
I won.

282
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
You beat me, scolded me,

283
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
beat me, and pinched me.

284
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
You tied me up with a rope

285
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
and forced me to crawl around the yard.

286
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
It's because I have never won the game.

287
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Now I won.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Mother,

289
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
did you see that?

290
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Why are you the second this time?

291
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why are you the second again?

292
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Can't you just

293
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
win him once?

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Lan'er,

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
do you know that

296
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I was the most favored female official

297
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
in the Wei Yuan Palace?

298
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
If not for your father's crime,

299
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
I would have married you

300
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
and married Wei Yuan.

301
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Why should I stay in this shabby room?

302
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
How dare you!

303
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
How dare you!

304
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
You will never change your mind!

305
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
You will never change your mind!

306
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
If I marry into the Marquis's Mansion,

307
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I will be a concubine.

308
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Mother,

309
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
don't worry.

310
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
I will win him once.

311
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I will win him once.

312
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Father fought in the battlefield all the years.

313
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
He never had a female official.

314
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
What a cheap trick!

315
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
He was very close to my mother.

316
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
There was a maid who was so greedy

317
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
that she seduced him after drinking.

318
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
But she was wrong.

319
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
She was wrong to my father's camp.

320
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Shut up!

321
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I won!

322
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
That maid was drunk

323
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
and left her job

324
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
and went back to her hometown to work.

325
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Her name is Zhou Yi.

326
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
She has two eight-character tigers.

327
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Enough!

328
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
You won me once.

329
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Can't you let me win once?

330
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I...

331
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
How can I win you once?

332
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Qin Yuzhang,

333
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm willing to

334
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
marry you.

335
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
I don't want to.

336
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
What if you lose?

337
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Shut up!

338
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
They are both good and evil.

339
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
They are both good and evil.

340
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
The Marquis is destined to be cursed.

341
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
We won.

342
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't cry.

343
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Don't cry.

344
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Mother.

345
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
I...

346
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
I won, right?

347
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Lan.

348
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
You won.

349
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
You won.

350
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
You won.
