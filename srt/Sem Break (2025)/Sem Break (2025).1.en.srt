Uh...

4
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,390
Just some random
videos on my feed, babe.

00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,645
Were you masturbating?

6
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:41,781
Huh?

7
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:44,647
No!

8
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:52,671
It’s okay even if you are.

Hello, Aria.

12
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:21,634
Yes. Me and Hannah are already set.

13
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,228
Alright. See you.

15
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,543
Is there a problem?

00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:44,709
Nothing.

17
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:51,089
Then why the sudden change of mood?

18
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:54,670
Sorry, I’m just tired.

19
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,050
Are you sure?

20
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:00,653
Mhm.

21
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,723
Why are you suddenly
in a different mood, really?

22
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,262
Was that Aria who called?

23
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,797
Why did she call?

24
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:15,908
It's about our flight tomorrow.

25
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,043
She rented a van.

26
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,210
We'll go to the airport together.

27
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,776
Are you really
sure about the trip?

28
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,316
Can’t we just pass on it?

29
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,895
Why?

30
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,506
Love, everything is already set.

31
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,667
Everything is booked.

32
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:52,793
The flight, the tours,
even the hotel.

33
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:54,955
Why shouldn't we go?

34
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:59,585
I need to study. My grades dropped.

35
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,120
Especially this semester.

36
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:04,656
I might lose my scholarship.

38
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:12,573
You can easily get your grades up again.

39
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,755
Besides, it’s too much trouble
for Aria if we don’t go.

40
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,992
They took care of everything.

41
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,102
We can't just cancel on them.

42
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,645
Are you sure you didn’t forget anything?

43
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,599
Where’s your passport?

44
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,667
It’s here.

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,608
- Everything's set?
- Yes.

46
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,696
Okay.

47
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,506
Where are they? Why are
they taking so long to get here?

48
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:04,295
I think it's them.

49
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:17,717

Let’s go guys, we’re
gonna be late for our flight.

so excited for our trip!

This is the first time
that you’ll be joining us.

Oh my God, let's go!

00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:47,745
Why do you look unhappy?

59
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,922
Don’t you wanna go with us?

60
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,588
No, it’s not that. I’m
actually really excited.

61
00:09:56,703 --> 00:10:01,082
It’s just that, I’m worried
about my grades. I feel like...

62
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:06,605
[ARIA] Girl! We’re on a break!
Stop thinking about school already.

63
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,135
- Try to relax, okay?
- Yeah.

00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,561
Don't be a killjoy.

65
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:14,240

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,294
And we're going now to Vietnam.

Just put those in the back.

00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,965
Welcome to Vietnam!

79
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,792
We are now here in Vietnam,

80
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,258
and with me is—
I’m like a reporter.

81
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:07,779
With me is Julian,
Owen, Hannah and Ysa.

82
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,048
Ysa, how’s Vietnam so far?

83
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:19,210
Are you hungry? Still full?

84
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,503
There are a lot of
Vietnamese behind me. Look.

85
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,483
- They’re not Vietnamese.
- They’re not? Oh!

86
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:28,512
Then they just look like
Vietnamese but they’re not.

87
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,669
I'll just smoke outside.

88
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:33,737
Come with me.

Looking for some hot girls. Why?

92
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,227
You are really crazy,

93
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,173
I thought you’re gonna change
after your last fight with your girlfriend.

94
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,300
Yeah, but she’s not here, right?

the Philippines is different,

96
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,352

I am single here.

You are really crazy!

99
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,659
If your girlfriend found out on
what you're doing, you're dead!

100
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:35,700
Then, I’ll just apologize again
and say that it won’t happen again.

if she leaves you.

- I've heard that so many times.

if you need anything.

This place is so far away.

119

If you don’t like it, then
just stay here outside.

120
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,525
What did you think,
why did you book here?

121
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,688
It’s so far from the city.
It's like a ghost town.

122
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,941
I did this on purpose.

123
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,969
Aside from the place is cheap,
there are only few people around.

124
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,411
We can be loud all we want, right?

125
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:02,303
- [YSA] Girl, you’re so smart!
- Come on!

126
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,963
I like your idea! Let’s go!

127
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,478
Let’s go inside.

128
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:08,543
If you're gonna complain,
you'll be left outside.

129
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:15,505
I think we’ll have fun here.

130
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,122
I’m so excited!

131
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,788
Guys, what can you say about it?
Do you like the place?

132
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:22,794
Yes, it's so nice!

133
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:23,912
I'm so excited.

134
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:26,106
Guys, you can
choose your own room.

135
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,638
I’ll just bunk here
on the sofa. Solo.

136
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,992
Let's go!

137
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:45,793
Are you sure about that?

138
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,186
Yes. I'll be fine here.

[giggling, chattering]

140
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,402
Let’s check this one.

141
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,506
Wow!

142
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,495
Oh my god!

143
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:12,191
Love, let’s get this room?

144
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,347
Okay, Love. I’ll just get
our things downstairs.

145
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:16,661
Okay.

146
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,861
Oh my god, girl!

147
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,932
[ARIA] It’s beautiful here!

148
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,993
Do you want to just
share the room with me?

149
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,512
Okay.

150
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,219
Oh, you seem forced.

151
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:34,020
It's as if you don't
want to bunk with me.

152
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,479
It's just that, I'm planning something.

153
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,903
What is it?

154
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:44,873
I need to make a move on Owen
before we get back home.

155
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,571
What?

156
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,613
With Owen?

157
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,089
Yes girl!

158
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,050
I’ve had my eye on
him for a while now.

159
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,662
Doesn’t he have a girlfriend?

160
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,738
Yes! So what?

161
00:15:58,669 --> 00:15:59,870
What do you think

162
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:04,049
is the reason I didn’t let
his girlfriend come to this trip.

163
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,074
Girl, are you sure about that?

164
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,824
What if she finds out?

165
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:10,872
And why him? He’s a playboy.

166
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,530
Exactly! I’m only
looking for sex.

167
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,636
His girlfriend won’t
know. Unless...

168
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:21,113
You’ll rat me out.
Will you tell her?

169
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,400
Oh my god! Let’s go!

170
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,629
Love, Aria is inviting
me to a girls’ night out.

171
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,699
No.

172
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,811
What do you mean no?

173
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,780
You can’t go with them alone.

174
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:51,500
Why?

175
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,847
Just trust me love, okay?

176
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,869
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

177
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,510
I’m just gonna hang
out with your friends.

178
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,891
What do you mean
something might happen to me?

179
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,464
I said no. Okay?

180
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,718
You know what,

181
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,513
I was actually half-hearted
about going here

182
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:26,873
because your friends and I
are not close.

183
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:34,963
We’ve been going out for a year
now and yet, I barely knew them.

184
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:40,091
This is my chance
to get to know them.

185
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:45,463
But I can’t understand
why you wouldn’t want that.

186
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,138
Love.

187
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,598
It’s because they do bad stuff.

188
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:55,051
And I know you're
not like that, right?

189
00:17:56,074 --> 00:18:01,046
It’s better if you keep your distance,
they can be quite persuasive. Okay?

190
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,315
The answer is no.

191
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:09,657
Okay.

192
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,927
Guys, Aria says we’re going out.

193
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,495
Where are we going?

194
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,007
To a bar!

195
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:20,811
We just got here.

196
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:25,291
So? Let’s go, stop wasting time.
Just go and change already.

Love, stop it, you’re drunk.

200
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,623
What? Just once, can’t you
just let me have fun once?

201
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,450
She’s right, Julian.
Just let her enjoy herself.

202
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,364
What do you mean let her be?
She's drunk, she can barely stand.

203
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:42,871
Isn’t this is what you want?

204
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:46,739
You know, let’s just go home.
Where’s Aria and Owen?

205
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,696
They went to the restroom.

206
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,897
You know what!

207
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:58,358
Take good care of Hannah.

208
00:21:58,492 --> 00:22:02,262
You do remember what happened the last
time you brought your girlfriend, right?

209
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,079
- Ysa!
- What happened?

210
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:05,113
What?

Where are they?

215
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,083
I told you, they went to the toilet.

Hannah is already dead drunk.
She’s about to pass out.

if we don’t go out. Let's go!

- Hi Hannah!
- Hi.

246
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:17,165
Why are you not in a bikini?

247
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,612
I'm sorry. I didn't bring one,
I didn't expect we'd be swimming.

248
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,111
Oh my God, girl, you can borrow
my bikini. I even have an extra one.

249
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:26,868
No, it’s okay. I’m fine here.

250
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,767
- It would be embarrassing.
- What are you saying?

251
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:31,011
It will be a waste if you
didn't take pictures here!

Hannah to get my extra bikini?

Sorry.

267
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:26,424
Maybe you ate something bad?

268
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:28,678
Right, what did you eat?

269
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:31,493
That's not it.

up with nothing, right?

kept coming up to me.

No.

It’s because you’re a one woman-man.

Sometimes, you should
also try playing around.

if she's really the one?

Don’t be like that, bro.

342
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,472
Alright.

343
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:25,033
Let me ask you this.

344
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:28,215
Does she already know what happened?

345
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,055
If you love her, you shouldn’t
be keeping secrets from her.

346

There, you see?

347
00:42:37,894 --> 00:42:39,663
She’s doesn't need to know.

Alright. That’s your relationship.
I’m just giving you advice.

349

I thought we could
forget about that.

350

We'll it's because you’re too
serious in this conversation. Let's go.

I don't know.

354
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:22,378
I can't explain it.

always come with us.

keeping you away from us.

00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,489
He’s too paranoid.

361
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:47,929
He's so afraid on what happened
with Denise will happen again.

362
00:43:53,016 --> 00:43:54,317
Denise?

363
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,034
You don’t know Denise?

364
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:02,381
Denise is the one…

365
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,440
Stop it, Ysa.

366
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:05,667
That’s nothing.

367
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:11,156
Just some wannabe bitch
who’s trying hard to join our group.

368
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:31,334
- Here’s the alcohol.
- Wow!

369
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:34,947
Hey, what’s that? You
didn’t even invite me.

370
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,940
Good shit bro.

371
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:40,859
[laughing]

372
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,168
Did you let Hannah take a puff?

373
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:48,544
Yeah. We were just bonding.

374
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:50,966
What?

375
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:53,986
You know Hannah doesn't do that.

376
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:58,686
Julian, chill. Nothing bad
happened to your girlfriend.

377
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:00,305
You’re being way too dramatic.

378
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,032
[laughing]

379
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,120
Oh my god!

380
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,017
Cheers!

[chattering, laughing]

383
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:34,254
Guys! Come on!
I’m getting bored. Let’s play.

384
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:35,626
What game?

385
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:37,688
Spin the bottle.

386
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:40,689
Sounds good. Let’s go?

387
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:44,196
You’re like little kids,
still wanting to play.

388
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:48,083
You’re such a buzzkill again.

389
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,480
Anyway, you guys know the rules!

390
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:54,318
No two truths in a row, and
you have to take the dare.

391
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:57,226
Game, let's go.

392
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,322
- Game!
- Let's go!

393
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,451
You have to do a dare.

394
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:10,419
Such a buzzkill. This is fun.

395
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,837
[upbeat music]

00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:58,749
[chattering, laughing]

397
00:48:25,396 --> 00:48:28,884
Hannah, truth or dare?

398
00:48:29,426 --> 00:48:30,552
Truth.

399
00:48:31,462 --> 00:48:33,021
- Truth?
- Yes.

400
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:36,542
I have a question.

401
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:42,036
Don’t you get jealous of
how close Aria and Julian are?

402
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,754
What kind of question is that, Ysa?

403
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:47,297
Why? It’s just a game.

404
00:48:48,084 --> 00:48:50,019
It’s okay. I’ll answer it.

405
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:54,188
Honestly...

406
00:48:55,771 --> 00:48:56,771
Yes.

407
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:00,468
I do get jealous.

408
00:49:05,202 --> 00:49:09,506
But I understand that
you’re all just friends.

409
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:14,630
Julian and I have been friends for a
long time too, but we’re not like that.

410
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:16,966
What’s your problem, Ysa?

411
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:21,880
Even Julian’s ex,
Denise, got jealous of Aria.

412
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,677
Oh wait, you don’t
know Denise, do you?

413
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:27,897
Ysa!

414
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:35,036
Yeah, Julian, why is it that
Hannah doesn’t even know Denise?

415
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:38,984
Looks like this kid hasn’t moved on yet.

416
00:49:39,403 --> 00:49:40,971
Have you moved on?

417
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:48,246
Oh no, guys, Julian’s getting mad.

418
00:49:48,758 --> 00:49:50,891
Let’s just continue the game.

419
00:49:56,145 --> 00:50:00,453
Owen, truth or dare?

420
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,386
What else? Of course, dare.

421
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,136
I dare you to make out with

422
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:10,565
someone here for seven minutes.

423
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,435
That’s too easy.

424
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:15,567
Just not Julian, okay?

425
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:19,381
Who's it gonna be?

426
00:50:20,276 --> 00:50:21,544
Who do you like?

427
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:27,123
Hannah? Ysa? Or me?

428
00:50:28,432 --> 00:50:29,712
You’re the one who suggested it.

429
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:41,779
We all know it’s not just seven minutes.
It's time for me to go and get rest.

430
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:51,081
I’m going out to get some air.

431
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:35,291
Love, why did you suddenly leave?

432
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:40,436
I’m just getting some air.

433
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:48,323
Why didn't you tell me about Denise?

434
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:54,036
Do I really need to tell
you every detail of my life?

435
00:54:55,344 --> 00:54:57,060
Not really, but it’s just that…

436
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,085
How about you?

437
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:01,468
Did I ever ask you about
your past relationships?

438
00:55:02,638 --> 00:55:03,739
I didn’t, did I?

439
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:08,781
I just want to know, love.

440
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,454
I have the right to, don’t I?

441
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:20,762
It’s nothing.

442
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,453
Denise is my ex-girlfriend long time ago.

443
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:26,649
She transferred school after we
broke up, that's what they said.

444
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,191
Are you okay now?

445
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:32,987
Love.

446
00:56:33,796 --> 00:56:35,364
I’ve been looking for you.

447
00:56:36,153 --> 00:56:38,088
I want to apologize.

448
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:41,831
You’re right.

449
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:46,889
I should’ve told you about Denise.

450
00:56:50,484 --> 00:56:54,844
I just wanted to forget her, because…

451
00:56:57,153 --> 00:56:58,354
I’m okay now.

452
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,152
I don’t need to
know the whole story.

453
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,457
Like you said,
it was a long time ago.

454
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:46,968
Where did you all come from?

455
00:57:47,276 --> 00:57:48,744
Why did everyone suddenly disappear?

456
00:57:49,418 --> 00:57:51,234
Ysa suddenly backed out.

457
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,389
Julian and I just went
out to get some air.

458
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,505
Why did Ysa leave?

459
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,423
We don’t know,
seemed like she’s mad.

460
00:58:01,804 --> 00:58:06,194
Ugh, that girl is so dramatic.
Just let her be.

461
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:13,881
Here, for some good vibes.

462
00:58:16,397 --> 00:58:17,627
We'll pass on that.

463
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,570
You’re such a killjoy, Julian.

464
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,467
Come on, it’s our
vacation anyway.

465
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,705
Count me in.

466
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:33,391
Oh, there we go.

467
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:03,358
I'll just go to the toilet for a bit.

468
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:29,281
[screaming]

469
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:34,623
Ysa! Ysa!

470
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,270
Aria, calm down first.

471
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:38,981
Calm down?

472
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:41,353
How am I supposed to calm down?

473
01:03:43,245 --> 01:03:45,422
My best friend is dead.

474
01:03:45,994 --> 01:03:49,162
Someone did this to her. Ysa!

475
01:03:49,857 --> 01:03:51,128
Ysa!

476
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,697
Could someone have gotten in here?

477
01:03:57,611 --> 01:03:58,946
Ysa!

478
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Here’s the plan.

479
01:04:00,523 --> 01:04:04,426
Owen and I will walk around first,
check if someone really got in here.

480
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:07,416
- Yes.
- Go to our room first.

481
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,086
Lock the door. Don't go out.

482
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:11,443
Let's go, Owen.

483
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:15,612
My best friend!

484
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:28,350
Ysa!

485
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:36,129
Ysa! Ysa is dead. I can’t
believe Ysa is really dead.

486
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:40,896
Hannah, it's us!

487
01:04:51,068 --> 01:04:52,544
We already checked
the whole place,

488
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,857
there’s no one else here, but us.

489
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:57,645
All the doors downstairs are locked too.

490
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,578
What do you mean?

491
01:05:00,662 --> 01:05:04,080
What do you mean?
Go around again.

492
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,706
No one else could
have done this.

493
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,691
It must be somewhere around here!

494
01:05:12,694 --> 01:05:14,897
Maybe we should call the police.

495
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,130
Police?

496
01:05:16,402 --> 01:05:17,467
We can't!

497
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,355
What do you mean we can’t?

498
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:21,451
Owen, Ysa is dead.

499
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,652
We need to call the police.

500
01:05:24,072 --> 01:05:25,240
Are you using your brain?

501
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:28,858
We’ve been drinking and
taken who knows what.

502
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:32,613
Do you think they’ll believe
us that we didn’t kill Ysa?

503
01:05:33,149 --> 01:05:34,840
We might even end up in jail.

504
01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:40,663
Oh my God. I don’t want to go to jail.

505
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:43,372
We can’t just let this go.

506
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:47,118
- I said we can’t call the police!
- Then, what should we do?

507
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,544
[JULIAN] Stop it!

508
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:50,312
Everyone calm down!

509
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,291
Let’s think about
what we should do.

510
01:05:53,635 --> 01:05:55,177
Calm down first
instead of arguing.

511
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:56,838
Love.

512
01:05:57,659 --> 01:05:59,729
Don’t tell me you
agree with Owen.

513
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:02,466
We need to call the police.

514
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,068
That’s the right thing to do.

515
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,929
[OWEN] I already said
that we can’t call the police!

516
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:09,146
Julian, control your girl!

517
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:12,107
We’ll be in bigger trouble
if we call the police.

518
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,545
- Bro, calm down!
- Move out of the way!

519
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,905
Owen, I’m going with you.

520
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:46,976
What are we still doing? I said
we should call the police already!

521
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,937
We're not going to call the police.

522
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:54,568
I can't think, I need to refresh.

523
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:07,882
Why do we even believe Owen?

524
01:07:08,063 --> 01:07:11,156
He only thinks about himself
instead of the situation right now.

525
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:16,585
Love, how are we supposed to find out who
killed Ysa if we won't ask for help?

526
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:18,137
What do you even know, huh?

527
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:21,029
You’re new to our group anyway.

528
01:07:22,016 --> 01:07:25,053
I know better what’s good for us.

529
01:07:25,686 --> 01:07:27,154
We're not calling the police.

530
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,867
Maybe the reason you don’t want
to is because you’re involved in this.

531
01:07:32,196 --> 01:07:33,196
What did you just say?

532
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,421
Hannah, what’s wrong with you?

533
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,051
No.

534
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:38,170
Don’t you ever wonder, love?

535
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,588
He’s being so defensive.

536
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,583
Why? It’s not even that hard to explain
the drugs and alcohol to the police.

537
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:50,118
But he keeps insisting that
we shouldn’t ask for help.

538
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:53,434
Wow.

539
01:07:53,642 --> 01:07:55,577
So you think you're
so brave, huh?

540
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,909
Julian, your girlfriend’s impressive!

541
01:08:00,248 --> 01:08:01,648
She actually knows
how to talk back!

542
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,204
You know,

543
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:06,841
you’re just Julian’s new girl.

544
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:11,550
Honestly, I think you’re just a toy,

545
01:08:12,514 --> 01:08:13,748
his flavor of the month.

546
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,392
You don’t matter here.

547
01:08:18,206 --> 01:08:21,843
And if there’s anyone we
should be suspicious of, it’s you.

548
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:25,606
Enough. That’s enough, bro.

549
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,875
Shit!

550
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:42,052
[screaming]

551
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:43,292
What happened?

552
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,487
D?

553
01:09:52,687 --> 01:09:53,919
Who’s D?

554
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:56,569
It's that bitch for sure.

555
01:09:57,732 --> 01:10:00,884
I knew that woman
wouldn’t stay quiet.

556
01:10:02,358 --> 01:10:04,160
This is your fault, Julian.

557
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:09,971
If you hadn’t brought her into
our group, Ysa wouldn’t have died.

558
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:13,955
How can we be so sure
that she’s the one who did it?

559
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:16,793
Because she's an obsessive bitch.

560
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:19,761
Wasn’t she crazy about you?

561
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:22,156
Maybe she followed you here.

562
01:10:23,706 --> 01:10:25,355
But why would she kill Ysa?

563
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,179
What else? To get revenge, of course.

564
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,783
Revenge for what?

565
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,189
Fix this, Julian!

566
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:38,565
I’m sure she’s the one who did it.

567
01:10:40,301 --> 01:10:42,779
If I see her...

568
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:45,179
I'll kill her!

569
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:47,285
Huh?

570
01:10:47,582 --> 01:10:50,085
I don’t understand.
What are you even saying?

571
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:53,222
Why don’t you ask your
wonderful boyfriend?

572
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:04,167
Even now, you still
don’t have any balls.

573
01:11:05,314 --> 01:11:07,216
No wonder that happened.

574
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:26,514
Hannah

575
01:11:27,089 --> 01:11:28,190
Hannah, wait!

576
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,475
What exactly are they saying?

577
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:36,876
Why don’t you want
to tell me the truth?

578
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:40,595
Julian, I look like a fool here.

579
01:11:40,909 --> 01:11:42,575
I’m the only one who
doesn’t know anything.

580
01:11:44,773 --> 01:11:46,608
They’re talking about Denise.

581
01:11:47,562 --> 01:11:49,558
What exactly
happened with your ex?

582
01:11:49,943 --> 01:11:51,743
Why did she do this to Ysa?

583
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:03,305
Two years ago,

584
01:12:04,118 --> 01:12:05,598
when Denise and I
were still together...

585
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:07,862
Something happened.

586
01:12:09,864 --> 01:12:10,864
Come in.

587
01:12:12,247 --> 01:12:13,248
Walk slowly.

588
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:17,633
Be careful. Wait.

589
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,573
This is your fault, you
drank too much alcohol.

590
01:12:25,413 --> 01:12:26,605
Here, sit here first.

591
01:12:27,448 --> 01:12:28,916
Rest for a while.

592
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,667
Wait for me, okay?
I’ll come back for you.

593
01:13:11,879 --> 01:13:13,581
Were you waiting for me?

594
01:13:15,971 --> 01:13:17,640
Why are you in my room?

595
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:23,203
I knew it—you’ve liked
me for a long time.

596
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,930
I’ll give you what you want.

597
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:58,796
Hey bro, wait a second.

598
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:00,437
I’m almost done.

599
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,410
Damn, your girlfriend’s really good.

600
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,502
[ARIA] It was really
fun going there!

601
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,664
Bitch.

602
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,410
You’re such a flirt.

603
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:15,075
You deserve it!

604
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:28,436
After that night,

605
01:15:29,451 --> 01:15:31,186
Denise talked to me.

606
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:36,317
She said she remembered
everything that happened.

607
01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:40,714
We fought.

608
01:15:42,423 --> 01:15:44,655
She asked me why I
let that happen to her.

609
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:49,504
I tried to explain to her
that I couldn’t stop Owen.

610
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:52,206
But she just kept crying.

611
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:56,646
The video had spread
throughout the whole school

612
01:15:57,645 --> 01:15:59,288
Denise fell into depression.

613
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:02,489
From then on, she
never went back to class.

614
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:07,094
I tried to talk to her several times.

615
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,318
I even went to her house.

616
01:16:13,254 --> 01:16:18,093
But I was shocked when I saw
Denise’s body, covered in blood.

617
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,523
You’re all shameless.

618
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,414
Absolutely shameless.

619
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:26,707
Hannah!

620
01:16:27,528 --> 01:16:30,064
How do you even
sleep at night, Julian?

621
01:16:31,232 --> 01:16:32,232
Hannah.

622
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:35,791
Every day...

623
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,752
I regret what happened to Denise.

624
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:45,367
That I couldn’t do
anything to help her.

625
01:16:47,289 --> 01:16:49,758
Every night I couldn't sleep properly.

626
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,809
My conscience kept eating me alive.

627
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,611
If Denise already killed herself,

628
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,816
then why does Aria think
she’s the one behind this?

629
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,920
I never told Aria what
happened to Denise.

630
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:10,663
That’s why I’m sure Denise
isn’t the one behind this.

631
01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:25,402
We need to find Denise
before she finds us.

632
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,443
Kill her before she kills us.

633
01:17:29,468 --> 01:17:31,230
We’ve already searched this whole place.

634
01:17:31,839 --> 01:17:33,078
There’s no one else here.

635
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,618
No sign of anyone
coming in, or out.

636
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:38,371
What?

637
01:17:39,093 --> 01:17:41,066
That means she’s still inside.

638
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:45,353
You probably just overlooked her.

639
01:17:46,415 --> 01:17:48,655
You know what, it’s better
if we just leave this place.

640
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:50,367
Let’s transfer to another hotel.

641
01:17:50,392 --> 01:17:52,077
Then let’s just go back
home to the Philippines.

642
01:17:52,446 --> 01:17:54,723
Let’s leave Julian
with Ysa’s body,

643
01:17:54,747 --> 01:17:56,146
- so they’ll be the ones trapped.
- No!

644
01:17:56,324 --> 01:17:59,560
No. I won’t leave
my best friend’s body.

645
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:04,680
I’ll find Denise. I’ll avenge Ysa.

646
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:08,550
Shit!

647
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,788
Hannah, wait.

648
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:50,246
Please, talk to me first.

649
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,661
Julian, I’m done.

650
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:57,318
My conscience can’t take this anymore.

651
01:18:58,766 --> 01:19:02,036
Because of you, Denise killed herself.

652
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,274
How do you even
sleep at night, Julian?

653
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:09,144
I know what I did was wrong.

654
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:11,612
But please...

655
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,057
Right now, we really need
to get out of this place.

656
01:19:18,619 --> 01:19:20,299
Have you seen Denise yet?

657
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:23,196
No.

658
01:19:24,805 --> 01:19:26,362
This is your fault, Julian.

659
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:31,248
You got yourself a flirty girlfriend,
and even brought her into our group.

660
01:19:32,526 --> 01:19:34,266
Denise isn’t the one who did this.

661
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:37,321
Then who would leave
a message like that?

662
01:19:38,766 --> 01:19:40,509
Denise is dead.

663
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:42,289
What?

664
01:19:43,511 --> 01:19:45,747
Denise killed herself.

665
01:19:48,503 --> 01:19:50,238
What is she saying, Julian?

666
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:52,727
What is Hannah talking about?

667
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:57,413
I went to see her when
she stopped going to school.

668
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,108
I was planning to talk to her,

669
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:03,395
but I was shocked

670
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,570
to find Denise already dead.

671
01:20:06,874 --> 01:20:08,676
That’s not true!

672
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,005
That’s not true!

673
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:12,219
Why?

674
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:17,377
Can’t you accept that because of you,
someone took their own life?

675
01:20:17,665 --> 01:20:18,991
What do you mean because of us?

676
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:21,388
We had nothing to do with that.

677
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,818
I know what happened.

678
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:27,514
Owen took advantage of her,

679
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:31,813
then you recorded it
and spread the video.

680
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,229
What the hell are you talking about?

681
01:20:34,922 --> 01:20:37,324
She was the one
throwing herself at Owen.

682
01:20:38,452 --> 01:20:42,723
Practically forcing herself
on him just to get his attention.

683
01:20:43,598 --> 01:20:48,543
And the reason I recorded her was
because she was such a damn cockblock.

684
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:51,592
She knew I had a crush on Owen.

685
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,447
And yet she still flirted with him?

686
01:20:54,222 --> 01:20:55,511
She deserved it.

687
01:20:57,945 --> 01:20:59,201
You’re unbelievable.

688
01:21:00,908 --> 01:21:04,085
The person’s already dead, and
that’s still what you have to say?

689
01:21:05,352 --> 01:21:09,657
She’s not dead. I’m sure
Denise is the one who did this.

690
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:12,567
Maybe someone wants
to take revenge for her.

691
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:13,834
Who?

692
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:15,335
What?

693
01:21:16,237 --> 01:21:17,237
You?

694
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:19,082
Maybe it’s you.

695
01:21:19,247 --> 01:21:20,715
Why would it be me?

696
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:23,058
We only just met you.

697
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:25,695
I don’t even know
where you came from.

698
01:21:26,988 --> 01:21:31,726
You’re just a transferee at school, and
suddenly you became Julian’s girlfriend?

699
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,779
Sounds suspicious to me.

700
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:39,002
Most likely, you’re the one
who keeps chasing Julian.

701
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:41,663
I have nothing to do with this.

702
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:45,834
If there’s anyone to blame,
it’s you, and not me.

703
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,596
Or maybe you and Julian
are really in this together?

704
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:52,979
As payback for your flirty ex.

705
01:21:54,335 --> 01:21:55,370
Just admit it.

706
01:21:55,695 --> 01:21:57,772
You’re both in on this.

707
01:22:02,123 --> 01:22:03,251
Aria, behind you!

708
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,251
[screams]

709
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:05,392
Run!

710
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,303
Oh, shit.

711
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,392
[screaming]

712
01:22:37,838 --> 01:22:39,940
Hide. Everyone, hide.

713
01:23:14,003 --> 01:23:15,356
How is this possible?

714
01:23:16,443 --> 01:23:18,545
I saw you dead.

715
01:23:20,904 --> 01:23:22,831
Oh please, Aria.

716
01:23:22,856 --> 01:23:24,564
Such a stupid bitch.

717
01:23:25,879 --> 01:23:28,451
Duh. I faked my own death.

718
01:23:28,997 --> 01:23:31,833
I knew it would be so
easy to make you believe it.

719
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,810
You didn’t even bother to check
my pulse to see if I was really dead.

720
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,252
But why?

721
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,116
Why are you doing this?

722
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,860
Did you kill Owen?

723
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,820
Yes. I killed Owen.

724
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,997
He deserved it anyway.

725
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:51,958
Aside from being a cheater,
he’s also a rapist.

726
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,963
He's the one who needs to go first.

727
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,899
And of course, the next will be...

728
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:02,704
But why are you doing this?

729
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:04,552
Why?

730
01:24:04,772 --> 01:24:07,208
Because you’re all worthless.

731
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,634
Every single one of you.

732
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,921
Especially you, Aria.

733
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:16,593
I’m tired of being your sidekick.
I’m tired of being your servant.

734
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,248
That’s your only reason?

735
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,955
Just because I treated you
like a sidekick?

736
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:24,637
Yeah. I wanted to be more.

737
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,671
Because know what, Aria?

738
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:30,952
I love you. I love you so much.

739
01:24:31,425 --> 01:24:33,429
But to you, I’m just a servant?

740
01:24:34,341 --> 01:24:36,546
Do you even know how painful that is?

741
01:24:36,937 --> 01:24:38,997
You see me as nothing but trash?

742
01:24:39,022 --> 01:24:42,680
And then what? You’ll just end
up with a worthless man like Owen?

743
01:24:43,837 --> 01:24:45,305
I will never allow that.

744
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,618
No one else will have you.

745
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:52,353
You're crazy!

746
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,657
Yes, I’m crazy.

747
01:24:55,682 --> 01:24:57,201
But not for long.

748
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:02,639
I’ll make it look like
I’m the only survivor.

749
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,566
Then I’ll start vlogging,

750
01:25:04,591 --> 01:25:09,215
and for sure, I’ll become famous as
the "Final Girl" from the massacre.

751
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,647
But don't worry guys

752
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,740
I’ll make a tribute for you.

753
01:25:21,206 --> 01:25:22,206
Ysa!

754
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,873
[screams in pain]

755
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,868
Ysa, have mercy please!

756
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,763
Ysa, don't do this!

757
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,433
I'm begging you!

758
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,970
Please, I'm begging you!

759
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:20,322
Please! Ysa! Have mercy!

760
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:23,911
Ysa!

761
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:29,984
[crying]

762
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,502
Hannah, stay here behind me.

763
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,480
[screaming]

764
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:53,401
What are you doing?

765
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,937
Isn’t it obvious?

766
01:28:09,836 --> 01:28:12,806
Did you really think I
did all of that alone?

767
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:16,958
Now, you’re going
to follow your friends.

768
01:28:18,905 --> 01:28:20,574
Don’t you remember?

769
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:24,559
Doesn’t Denise have a sister?

770
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:28,172
A step sister, to be exact.

771
01:28:33,394 --> 01:28:36,464
Oh, you remember now?

772
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,420
Well,

773
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,542
I’ve been planning
this for a long time.

774
01:29:09,343 --> 01:29:13,180
I did everything just
to infiltrate your group.

775
01:29:14,174 --> 01:29:17,045
I endured all of your lies,

776
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:22,609
all of your gaslighting, just
so I could avenge my sister.

777
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:28,529
Hannah, please. Don’t do this, please.

778
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,674
Did you really think I’d
let you get away with it?

779
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:11,995
You bitch.

780
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:43,870
Hannah.

781
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:45,405
Please.

782
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,609
What am I doing?

783
01:30:49,099 --> 01:30:50,099
Hmm?

784
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,047
You’re all the same!

785
01:30:55,001 --> 01:30:58,188
Every single one of you is heartless.

786
01:31:00,397 --> 01:31:05,268
Because of you, Denise
is dead. My sister is dead!

787
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,914
I didn’t do anything to her,
I didn't do anything, you're mistaken.

788
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:12,478
Exactly! You didn’t do anything!

789
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,536
You let her die!

790
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:23,678
You carry the greatest
sin against my sister.

791
01:31:27,527 --> 01:31:31,052
If you truly loved her, you
should have done something.

792
01:31:31,077 --> 01:31:33,136
You should have done something!

793
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,045
Hannah.

794
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,096
Sorry, sorry.

795
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:10,324
Sorry Hannah, sorry!

796
01:32:31,912 --> 01:32:34,415
Sorry, Hannah.

797
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:50,364
I'm sorry!

798
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,814
Hannah!

799
01:32:59,948 --> 01:33:01,450
Hannah!

800
01:33:01,628 --> 01:33:02,784
Hannah!

801
01:33:02,863 --> 01:33:07,032
[crying]

802
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:17,430
Hannah, I'm sorry!

803
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:51,691
Hello?

804
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,515
Please help me!

805
01:33:57,937 --> 01:34:00,737
All of my friends are dead.

806
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:07,374
[crying]
