00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,560
This isREDIF

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,840
O hätou

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,560
Bake

00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,120

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,020
Shukan

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
Look out!

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,020
It's just the season of war!

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,020
Listen!

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,020
It's illusions you can't talk to!

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,020
I'm sorry for the wait.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Shogen.

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,020
Don't be so busy.

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Takahata.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,020
I have a good idea.

16
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,020
The story of Mr. Tanuma's death

17
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,020
The story of Mr. Tanuma's death

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,020
This one, I want you to give it to Mr. Uesama.

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,020
The story of Mr. Tanuma's death

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,020
The story of Mr. Tanuma's death

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
Don't belittle him

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,020
Don't belittle him

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
You want me to tell him

24
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,020
Don't use your mouth

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,020
Don't talk murderers

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,020
According to my usual brother

27
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,500
Masamaru

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,260
Mah-pani City

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
You're pleasingี้

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,580
Thanks for watching

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,280
That's diligence

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,380
You're a perfect fit

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
Look a step

34
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,140
By full stretch

35
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Yoshimura, who started to take back the right-hand side, says goodbye.

36
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,540
The second-hand

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,540
I'm glad I got the first one.

38
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,540
I'm going to ask him to make the next delicious meal.

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
That's it.

40
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,540
I'm going to ask him to make the second-hand

41
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,540
You're not going to do that.

42
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,540
But the second-hand is not as expensive as the second-hand.

43
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,540
I think it's better if the parents follow the money.

44
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Leave it to me.

45
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,540
Are you going to be safe?

46
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,540
You're right.

47
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,540
The second-hand is...

48
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,540
Do you think this is a good thing to do?

49
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,540
You're going to ask me to make the second-hand.

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
I got it.

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,540
Let me do it.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,540
I was told by my father.

53
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,540
How much do you have to pay for the rent?

54
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
So you have to pay for the rent.

55
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,540
You can't just go out and do something.

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,540
You can't just go out and do something.

57
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,540
I can't see the story at all.

58
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,540
I've got a story from my father.

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,540
The next day, I'll give you two money.

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,540
And I'll give you one free meal.

61
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
Free meal?

62
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,540
You're saying that you have a lot of money.

63
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,540
The two of you are in the same house.

64
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,540
I'm not going to give you two free meals.

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,540
You're saying that you have a lot of money.

66
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,540
You're not going to give me free meals.

67
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,540
You're going to ask me to make the second-hand.

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,540
You're going to ask me to make the second-hand.

69
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Mr. Tsutachi.

70
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
What?

71
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,540
I think you can't pay for the rent.

72
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,540
But you have to pay for the rent.

73
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,540
You have to pay for it.

74
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

75
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,540
If you get the rent, I won't have any money left.

76
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,540
And you can take it to the cashier at the shop.

77
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,540
I'm not going to ask you to pay for the rent.

78
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,540
If you don't ask me to pay, I'll go to the shop and pay for it.

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,540
I'm going to pay for the rent.

80
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,540
I'm going to pay for the rent.

81
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,540
I'm going to pay for the rent.

82
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

83
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

84
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

85
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

86
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

87
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

88
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

89
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

91
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

92
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

93
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

95
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

96
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

97
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

98
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

99
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

100
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

101
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

102
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

103
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

104
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

105
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

106
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

107
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

108
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

109
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

110
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

111
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

112
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

113
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

114
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

115
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

116
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

117
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

118
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

119
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

120
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

121
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm not going to pay for the rent.

122
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I heard that the father of Masamaru-sama

123
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
is a demon.

124
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I'm a demon.

125
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,540
He was supposed to be a misdeed.

126
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,540
I'm sure you should call Masamaru to Tias.

127
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
You can't even think of it.

128
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,540
If you don't let me hear your prayers while you're afraid.

129
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't have a child in spring and autumn.

130
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,540
If Masamaru is gone, Tias might be able to stand.

131
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:04,540
I'm sure you can't stop Masamaru from being worried.

132
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Good bye.

133
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,540
Did you hear from the heart of Jihii?

134
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,540
I understand your prayers.

135
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
I ask you to be merciful.

136
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,540
I wish you good luck from the beginning.

137
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Yes, sir.

138
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,540
I have become more and more suspicious than you.

139
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Jihii, I'm Reo, who saved Makoto.

140
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:46,540
No, I'm just a sign of your mercy.

141
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Yes, I'm a sign of your mercy.

142
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm a sign of your mercy.

143
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Masamaru, please be careful of Tanuma.

144
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,540
Tanuma?

145
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
This white river is snowing.

146
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,540
In the first place, Tanuma is taking Uesama to Teremani.

147
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,540
She is moving the island as she wishes.

148
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,540
As expected, it's better to give up on the sword of the two.

149
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,540
Okita, the job of the Baku is giving Tias.

150
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm sure it's 100,000 million.

151
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
100,000 million?

152
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Yes, it may be a calm state.

153
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,540
It's a waste of time to live in a place like this.

154
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,540
I didn't know that.

155
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,540
Do you want to destroy Tias?

156
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
I already have a third party.

157
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,540
What is the third party?

158
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,540
Baku is a traitor.

159
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,540
He may be able to say that he is a traitor.

160
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,540
Okita, do you want to do it?

161
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Hello.

162
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
Hello.

163
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Hello.

164
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Hello.

165
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
I've seen it.

166
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,540
You're embarrassed.

167
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
I've seen it.

168
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,540
I'm glad you're on the second party.

169
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Thanks.

170
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,540
I've returned to Yoshihara.

171
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Shigai, I wanted to say something.

172
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Yoshihara is a traitor.

174
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,540
She can't be trusted by her husband.

175
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Don't be so harsh.

176
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
She may be able to do something.

177
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Well, I guess she's just making a Japanese painting.

178
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,540
She's trying to make a girl's painting.

179
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
But she can't afford it.

180
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,540
You can't just let her get away with it.

181
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,540
I'm not saying that.

182
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,540
I'm the one who can do it.

183
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,540
You're the one who can do it.

184
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,540
No, I'm fine.

185
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Thank you for waiting.

186
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,540
I'll be waiting for you.

187
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,540
Thank you.

188
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
Oh, that's nice.

189
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,540
I guess there's nothing.

190
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,540
Oh, it's a statue.

191
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Oh, it's a statue of Gennai.

192
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,540
What's going on?

193
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,540
I'm going to see it today.

194
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Oh, really?

195
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Well, I'm going to call you.

196
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Hey, you!

197
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Hey, you!

198
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Hey, you!

199
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,540
Hey, you!

200
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
Hey, you!

201
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Hey, you!

202
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
Hey, you!

203
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Hey, you!

204
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
Oh, that's nice.

205
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Are you living around here?

206
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,540
Well, I'm almost in the mountains.

207
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,540
I think it's a good place to live in the new place.

208
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Oh, I see.

209
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Sorry, did you read this?

210
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Oh, that's nice.

211
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,540
I read it on the special edition.

212
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,540
I'm going to see the head of the man who talks with me.

213
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,540
That's here.

214
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,540
The man who talks with me.

215
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Oh, that's nice.

216
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Come here.

217
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
Hey, you!

218
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Wow, that's so popular.

219
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Do you know him?

220
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,540
No.

221
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,540
He's a good man.

222
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
He's a good girl.

223
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
He's a young girl.

224
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,540
He's a good girl.

225
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,540
He's a good guy.

226
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,540
He's a good guy.

227
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,540
That's the one with the clothes and the big face.

228
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
Hey, Hachi.

229
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,540
You're wearing this coat.

230
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Oh, no. I've never seen this before.

231
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
What's this shop?

232
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
What's this shop?

233
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
What's this shop?

234
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
This is it!

235
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Oh, sorry.

236
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
I'm a little...

237
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Sir, you're the best in the world.

238
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Morning!

239
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Good night.

240
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
This is...

241
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
the clothes I've been wearing.

242
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,540
I've told you that you should know less about this.

243
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,540
I've told you that you should know less about this.

244
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,540
This is the clothes I've been wearing.

245
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,540
You're going to enter the 5th house and give me the 2nd place?

246
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
Yes.

247
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm going to give you the clothes I want to sell.

248
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,540
Then you can go to the store.

249
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Then you can enter the 5th house and give me the 1st place.

250
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,540
I'm going to make you pay for this.

251
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,540
I'm going to make you pay for this.

252
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm going to make you pay for this.

253
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Hey, how much did you make?

254
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,540
How many did you make?

255
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,540
I made 200 of them.

256
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,540
I made 200 of them.

257
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
If you don't mind, I'll...

258
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Shut up!

259
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Sir.

260
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
Yes.

261
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Then, if you have the money in the 5th house, I'll call you.

262
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
You can talk to me.

263
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I'll give you more than this.

264
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,540
Of course, I'll give you more than this.

265
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
I'm going.

266
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:20,540
From this day on, the 2nd house has become a house of Yoshihara who can visit the 5th house.

267
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,540
Then, what do you think?

268
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
I'll tell my father.

269
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
I see.

270
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
I see.

271
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:37,540
I want to make a house of Yoshihara who can visit the 5th house.

272
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
No, no.

273
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,540
I'll think about it.

274
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Damn it.

275
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
Good morning.

276
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Can I have a little?

277
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,540
I can't go to the 5th house.

278
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,540
It's a strange story that 3 people can visit the 5th house.

279
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,540
Isn't there a girl who can be called a girl?

280
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
What?

281
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,540
She's a girl of the Kikunoh castle, so she can go to the girl.

282
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,540
She can wear a kimono to anyone.

283
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I see.

284
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
She can't be called a girl.

285
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
What?

286
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:32,540
Do you think Yoshihara's dirty house will raise a decent house of Nishikie?

287
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,540
It's raining, so I'm not done yet.

288
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Oshi!

289
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Mr. Nishimurae, hello.

290
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Hey, did you know about me?

291
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
Do you know about me?

292
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,540
I'm a famous man who doesn't know Nishimurae.

293
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm a famous man in the middle of the world.

294
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,540
Nishimurae and Nishikie?

295
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
Yes.

296
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm in charge of the house of Nishikie.

297
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,540
I'm going to talk about Nishikie in the Raimonjiya house.

298
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm going to ask him to buy me a piece of it.

299
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
I'll ask him to buy me a piece of it.

300
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Mr. Oshi, how do you plan to raise Nishikie?

301
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm thinking about the shop in the 5th house and Yoshihara's house.

302
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Where do you want to go?

303
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
I'll try to find out.

304
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Mr. Nishimurae, can you help me?

305
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,540
If you want, I can help you with the other business.

306
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Please.

307
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll do it.

308
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Okay.

309
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
How is it?

310
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
It's getting better.

311
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540
I see.

312
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Nishimurae's participation is a great success.

313
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,540
The studio succeeded in getting a gift from the 5th house.

314
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
Please wait a moment.

315
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Nishimurae's work is also good for the beauty.

316
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,540
It was decided at the time of the Edo period.

317
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Mr. Nishikie.

318
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Mr. Oshi, how do you think about the half-baked garden?

319
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
What?

320
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,540
You're a great half-baked garden with so many Nishikie.

321
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
I see.

322
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,540
I see.

323
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,540
I'm half-baked.

324
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Finally, the underground painting of the Koryu-sai is complete.

325
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Wait.

326
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
Don't ask for the shop.

327
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,540
I'll show you the time at the night shop.

328
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
The color and pattern are good for this.

329
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
I see.

330
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Please tell me about it.

331
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Okay.

332
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,540
Then, why don't you tell me about the house?

333
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
What do you want?

334
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
I'll tell you.

335
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Mr. Keina, do you want to do the painting?

336
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
Yes.

337
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Where did he go?

338
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
What did Mr. Chinasu do?

339
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
I wonder if he met him.

340
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Mr. Chinasu.

341
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I see.

342
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
I see.

343
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I see.

344
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Here you are.

345
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Oh, the painting master.

346
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
I got it.

347
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,540
I taught him how to paint.

348
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
He's so cute.

349
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
What do you want today?

350
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Well,

351
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,540
I'm going to show you the Nishikie.

352
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Oh, you're a good half-baked garden.

353
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
Thank you.

354
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Can you tell me what my name is?

355
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,540
What's your name?

356
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Dogo.

357
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Dogo.

358
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Dogo.

359
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Yes.

360
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Mr. Keina.

361
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,540
I got a great painting.

362
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
Excuse me.

363
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I'll get the clothes.

364
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,540
I'll get the clothes.

365
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
This is the first time I see you.

366
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Oh, no!

367
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,540
I thought you were a good person.

368
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,900
Well,

369
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,360
Mr. Owl,

370
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,540
could you try it?

371
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
Really?

372
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,960
I think this really is......

373
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,680
It won't suit you.

374
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,540
I'm going to the hospital.

375
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,540
I'm going to the hospital.

376
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,540
I'm going to the hospital.

377
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,540
I'm going to the hospital.

378
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,540
I'm going to the hospital.

379
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
I'm going to the hospital.

380
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm going to the hospital.

381
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
I'm going to the hospital.

382
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,540
I'm going to the hospital.

383
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
I'm going to the hospital.

384
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I'm going to the hospital.

385
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,540
I'm going to the hospital.

386
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,540
I'm going to the hospital.

387
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm going to the hospital.

388
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540
I'm going to the hospital.

389
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,540
What's wrong?

390
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,540
I can only see the original picture.

391
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,540
Why are you doing this?

392
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Why?

393
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
You're going to be a terrible doctor.

394
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,540
What?

395
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
You'll be sure.

396
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
No.

397
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,540
I'll be your first doctor.

398
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
No.

399
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
I don't want to be a doctor.

400
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Oh, sorry.

401
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
I don't want to be pushed.

402
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
No.

403
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
I'm happy.

404
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,540
I've never been told that.

405
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
I'll do it.

406
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
Okay.

407
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,540
This is how you do it.

408
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
You do it again and again.

409
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
You do it again and again.

410
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
You do it again and again.

411
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,540
You do it again and again.

412
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,540
You're doing it well.

413
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,540
I'm glad.

414
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,540
I'm glad you're satisfied with my first doctor.

415
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
I'm glad you're satisfied with my first doctor.

416
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,540
You're so cute.

417
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,540
I'm glad you're satisfied with my first doctor.

418
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,540
I'll be sure.

419
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Okay.

420
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,540
Okay.

421
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
I'll do it.

422
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Oh, my.

423
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,540
I think I've been drawn from the nose.

424
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Oh, my.

425
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
rowman,

426
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,540
How did you write this?

427
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,540
I actually never told you all that much.

428
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Twelve things that could be used.

429
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,540
When Each color is the same,

430
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,540
each is mixed with a bunch of things.

431
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,540
What oboches look familiar...

432
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:16,540
But, is it true that Masamaru-sama has already become a master of this Monjo?

433
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Then, he'll be aware of it.

434
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I borrowed this Monjo from the school, but he was wearing a thick coat.

435
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,040
Oh, so you're not a master of this Monjo?

436
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,040
You've with couriers' Іponyther.

437
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:48,040
But look over the Monjo's eyes so her eyes are gone.

438
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,040
How it is!

439
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:59,540
If I take such스� emerged into measure,

440
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,540
I will do anything.

441
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,980
A whoever he might be.

442
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,820
Let's just first adopt the order.

443
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,620
You can't waste another pilot theako…

444
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,180
Tiasuke, Andayama-san, to finish her off.

Sen接優環以冷国小学はあなたの信仰に主状であり

乃は覧木械で熟天ですず言だそうです。

447
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,060
If you don't have a white horse, you'll be punished for your misdeeds.

448
00:30:36,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Yoshimune himself was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one

450
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,820
by the way

451
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,540
masamaru-sama received that past

452
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,460
also muster

453
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,420
said secretly

454
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,400
seed of the

455
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,640

456
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,020
the matter

457
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,260
his

458
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,320
Gozaima

459
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,680
He seems to have no other

461
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,440
and yat

462
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,960
killed

463
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,600
masamaru-sama

464
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,600
If you want to return to Taias,

465
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,600
you must keep your promise.

466
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Then...

467
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
And,

468
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
do you want to die, Masamaru-sama?

469
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I...

470
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
I want to die.

471
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Yes.

472
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,600
I wonder if you want to return to Taias

473
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,600
to the place where you have been

474
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,600
and to return to Taias.

475
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Then...

476
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
I won't answer you.

477
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Please think about it now.

478
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,600
I won't mind that word.

479
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I'm afraid you won't be able to do anything.

480
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Please, if you want to return to Taias...

481
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
If you want to say goodbye,

482
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
you must keep your promise.

483
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Masamaru-sama...

484
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Why are you so stubborn?

485
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
You can't go this far.

486
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Masamaru-sama!

487
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Look at me now.

488
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm a coward.

489
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Hey,

490
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
what does the school name mean?

491
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Well,

492
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
that's...

493
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
You know,

494
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
I'm going to be a leader of Taias

495
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
and take over the school name.

496
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I want to live in a more and more rich country

497
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
on this day.

498
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Yes.

499
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Thank you.

500
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
I've received a very strange name.

501
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
But you're a good person.

502
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Yes.

503
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Let's go.

504
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Let's go.

505
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Let's go this way.

506
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
This way.

507
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Everyone in the country,

508
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
please.

509
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Thank you for coming.

510
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Mr. Udon,

511
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
there was a Mr. Nishimura here.

512
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
But the person who said

513
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Mr. Uroko and Mr. Tsuruya are together...

514
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Yes?

515
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm sorry to have to refuse.

516
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Please come in.

517
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Yes, sir.

518
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Please wait.

519
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Please.

520
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Oh.

521
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm sorry for the sudden visit.

522
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,600
I'm Uroko Gata and Magobe of Jihon-don.

523
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,600
I'm also Tsuruya Kiemon.

524
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
I'm sorry.

525
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Suddenly?

526
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
No.

527
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Later,

528
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
I had a little talk with you.

529
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
I'm sorry to bother you.

530
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Please come in.

531
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Everyone,

532
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
please come in.

533
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
What a smart man.

534
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm also a beautiful lady.

535
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
But I'm also a beautiful woman.

536
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Let's take a look at this.

537
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
It's so beautiful.

538
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
This is beautiful.

539
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
It's so beautiful.

540
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Thank you for your interest.

541
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,600
I'm going to work with Mr. Nishimura

542
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,600
and Mr. Hatsumo of Hinagata Wakana.

543
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Well,

544
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
I'm going to work with

545
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,600
the one and only Hamoto of Hinagata Wakana.

546
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
One and only?

547
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Sorry, Mr. Itsutazu.

548
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I was looking at the Sadame.

549
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
If you want to join us,

550
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
you can join us.

551
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,600
I don't understand what you mean.

552
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Amongst all,

553
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,600
the only thing that is recognized by the members of Jihon-don is the Sadame.

554
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
But the studio is also under the Otaku's control.

555
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
That's a new thing.

556
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
It's good to see it again.

557
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
But,

558
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,600
it's impossible to become a Hakkou person.

559
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
It's okay to see it again,

560
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
but it's impossible to become a Hamoto.

561
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Then,

562
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
how about the first one?

563
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Oh,

564
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
you didn't say anything at all.

565
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,600
That's a gift from Yoshihara.

566
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Please do as you please.

567
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
But,

568
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,600
if you say that you want to sell this book in the middle of the night,

569
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
that's impossible.

570
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
So,

571
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,600
you mean that you can't sell the book I made in the middle of the night?

572
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
That's right.

573
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,600
The Jihon-don night that we do with Hamoto

574
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
is a book that we make together

575
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
at a shop outside of the house.

576
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
In other words,

577
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
if you can't sell this book

578
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
that you don't have in your company,

579
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
then it's a mistake.

580
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
But,

581
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
there are Nishimura-sama in this book,

582
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
and Nishimura-sama is one of the members of the company.

583
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
So,

584
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,600
if you can sell it alone,

585
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,600
then you can't sell it.

586
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
If you have a studio,

587
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
can you sell it in the middle of the night?

588
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I have a kimono,

589
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
but I can't sell it in the middle of the night.

590
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Then,

591
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,600
would you like to see this in your company?

592
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I'd like to see it.

593
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Do you understand?

594
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Then,

595
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
what should I do with the one who comes later?

596
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
The one who comes later

597
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
can't become Hamoto?

598
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Yes.

599
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,600
I wonder if you will be Hamoto

600
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
in the future.

601
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Well,

602
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I thought you would be the one to do it.

603
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Everyone is a little bit of a fool.

604
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
That's what you mean.

605
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
If you do that,

606
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
you will be saved every time.

607
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
You're a fool.

608
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Well,

609
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
I'm the one who did it.

610
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I did it all.

611
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I did everything I thought and ran.

612
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Hey!

613
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I have to do it.

614
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Jyuzan!

615
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Don't talk about strange things.

616
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
It's for Yoshihara.

617
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Yoshihara is the reason

618
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
why the Nishikiwa is so large.

619
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
For Yoshihara,

620
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
please give me a good one.

621
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Well,

622
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
for Yoshihara's sake.

623
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
well,

624
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
what if they break the aluminum plate by hand?

625
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,560
Go,

626
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
get to the location and break the iron plate.

627
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Shit.

628
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
It's food.

629
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Well done.

630
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Well,

631
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
you are the 对

632
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
leader and Nich vehicle over here.

633
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,600
You're so good at this.

634
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
But, you were talking about Ume.

635
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I didn't think you'd be so bold when you were in love.

636
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I'm glad to hear that.

637
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,600
But, what do you think of the studio?

638
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Look,

639
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I want to make him and Yoshihara a whole family.

640
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
A family of people who want to be together,

641
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
a family of windmills who want to hit the people.

642
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,600
The success of the desire will be given to those who want to be together.

643
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Then, I'll go and see them.

644
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I can't figure it out.

645
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Kennai-san!

646
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
What's wrong, Toku?

647
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Oh, my god!

648
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Oh, my god!

649
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Hurry up!

650
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm in trouble!

651
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,600
I'll be in the kitchen tonight.

652
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Thank you!

653
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
I'll be in the kitchen tonight.

654
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Karamaru?

655
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Karamaru?

656
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
If Karamaru is in trouble,

657
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
I'll be in trouble.

658
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I think Karamaru is back to his home.

659
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Kennai!

660
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
I'll be in the kitchen tonight.

661
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Karamaru!
