00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 3

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is my recent idea of making Chitajuu.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, I'm too good at riding.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Chitajuu.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Can I put this in?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why is my stomach...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Did you tell Rokokate-san that you were hiding?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ah...

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then you thought I was going to be fired.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Fired?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's been a long time since I last saw Yoshihara.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Please, stop it.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well then...

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
At that time, Yoshihara had been writing Yoshihara's opinion a number of times.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She will be making a new product in the future.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If I make a new product, I will be grateful to her.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's...

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's a clean finish.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You fixed it properly.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's a great skill.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Rokokate-san, this is a piece of clothing.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes. It's about Hiragagen-nai.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hiragagen-nai?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
She is a master of Hiragagen-nai, a famous Japanese martial arts teacher.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh...

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can't sell this?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can't increase the number of customers?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The studio asked me to do it.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is this our Juzaburo?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yoshihara wanted to invite customers, so she gave the Joro shop a very detailed review.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, a new product?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is a fixed product.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, Yoshihara!

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Good morning.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You...

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why do you refuse me?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What's this?

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Re-reviewing Juzaburo again?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will not let you continue the re-review.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When did you become a professional?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The customers are being thrown into the market.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And they are not allowed to take the money.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you don't do something, Yoshihara will not come back.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You are saying that the customers will come back?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will definitely pull the customers to Hiragagen-nai.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You are pulling the customers to do this.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will come.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I will come to you.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Help me.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stop it.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Stop it.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Stop it.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Stop it.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The customer is coming.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The customer is coming.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The customer is coming.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The customer is coming.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The customer is coming.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The customer is coming.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The customer is coming.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The customer is coming.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The customer is coming.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The customer is coming.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The customer is coming.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The customer is coming.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The customer is coming.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The customer is coming.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The customer is coming.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The customer is coming.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The customer is coming.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The customer is coming.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The customer is coming.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The customer is coming.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The customer is coming.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The customer is coming.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The customer is coming.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The customer is coming.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The customer is coming.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The customer is coming.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The customer is coming.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The customer is coming.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The customer is coming.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The customer is coming.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The customer is coming.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The customer is coming.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The customer is coming.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The customer is coming.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The customer is coming.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The customer is coming.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The customer is coming.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The customer is coming.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The customer is coming.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The customer is coming.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The customer is coming.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The customer is coming.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The customer is coming.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The customer is coming.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The customer is coming.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The customer is coming.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The customer is coming.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The customer is coming.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The customer is coming.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The customer is coming.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The customer is coming.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The customer is coming.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The customer is coming.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The customer is coming.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The customer is coming.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The customer is coming.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The customer is here.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The customer is coming.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The customer is coming.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The customer is coming.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The customer is coming.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Juza,

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
listen.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If the customer comes here,

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the father may be watching over us.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you still not coming?

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm just going to be thrown away.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yoshihara.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is Otoshidama.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yoshihara's reenactment?

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What?

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a meeting with a souvenir.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to write a letter.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What about the mountain of your father?

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Unfortunately, the money may not be buried.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But the iron is coming out.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't think it's necessary to leave the iron.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You said you were thinking about the iron.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, I asked you what you want.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Father, this is the one you came to do yesterday.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is Yoshihara's.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The iron is a mess.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't care about the god.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm just going to call someone.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A thank you stone?

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So you're going to call Yoshihara?

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to call her.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But even though Yoshihara's reenactment is sold out,

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the customers are very happy.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How is it?

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm not going to be able to see you today.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's refreshing.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm often sold out.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What kind of color is this?

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to call it.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I just read the one I bought recently.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It might be the best.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What should we do next?

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mr. Tsurugaya is going to work again?

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But why?

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't think there's a job that's like a job to be bored of tea.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I might have died if I didn't get picked up by my father.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't like that guy who's too much.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When the studio was lined up with iron,

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
a lot of complaints were coming out.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Shiraka Matsudaera is going to kill Mr. Nasamaru Tayasu?

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't give up.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm going to say it again.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What do you want to do, Mr. Shiraka?

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I want to get a job for Yoshimune-kun and give him a high-quality job.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But I don't think I've done anything wrong.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm so worried.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Tayasu's senpai is alive.

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I wonder if he's going to do something like a good person like that?

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's a big deal.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now or never.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sure he's going to do it again.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But if we don't get this job back,

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
we'll be in a lot of trouble.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You should have told him before.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But I want to take your opinion now.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My opinion?

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The day before yesterday, I was in a meeting with Mr. Masamaru.

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
At that time, he said,

191
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
he was going to kill me, and I was going to kill him.

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He was the one who killed me.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was also so impressed by Mr. Shogen.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was so...

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was so...

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So?

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That young man who's so wise

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
will be able to keep his mouth shut without any help from him.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Will he be able to reveal the future?

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did you run into your brother from the beginning?

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was told that you were going to kill him.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't think so.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think it's better to go to Shirakawa and shake hands with the guards in the city.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's right.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I want to kill Uesuma and Taisu.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Brother.

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't you think that after you get the job,

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
the Taisu will disappear from the village?

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm also worried about that.

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't expect that you would say such a good thing.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was told to take a step back from you.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Step back from you?

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What will you do with that?

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll kill you.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Shut up!

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Shut up!

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Shut up!

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You killed Kangen.

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You killed Uesuma.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you think that's what you said?

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You said that you killed Uesuma when I was working?

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you want me to do that?

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're free to do that.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
March 3rd, 3rd of the year.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The Yoshingumi of Masamaru-sama's Shirakawa Matsudaira was decided.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mr. Yu, what are you going to do in the new year?

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to find my father and talk to the three of them.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're kidding me.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sister!

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Mr. Yu, you're so kind.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you doing? Hurry up!

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes!

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm in the city of Niigata.

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Goodbye.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What's wrong?

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I was sold out in the city.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Go ahead.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think she's made a mistake.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No.

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I just put them down there.

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was sold out as a maid.

245
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have no other choice.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The reason I came here is because I was forced to do something in order.

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I thought this place would be over if I let go of my hand.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But...

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okami-san, can you just stay here for a little longer?

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll do something.

251
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I can't do anything to you!

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll do anything!

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll do my best.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't do anything to you.

255
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I think this is the only place I can be friends with.

256
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Even if you say this is the only place I can be friends with,

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think it's a dangerous place.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Ok!

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Then, go!

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I have a request.

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Move!

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Move!

264
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry for the wait.

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hananoi, what is the request of the first generation?

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Actually, I have a story like this.

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The silver bowl that Joro collected?

270
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is it the silver bowl?

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a book that makes money.

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It seems that the line between the two is decided by the amount of money.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes.

274
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I can't put in more than 30 of that.

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
30?

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll put in the book in any case.

278
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hasegawa-sama.

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not done yet.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hasegawa-sama.

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hasegawa-sama.

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The studio first sets up the silver bowl project.

283
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The money is the same as the money that was collected from the refrigerator.

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
From the studio.

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
50?

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
In addition, the project that was set up is talked to Joro and the others.

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
By the way, did you also make money?

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I put in 50 of the silver bowl and decided on the money.

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What should I do?

290
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm afraid that the money will be spent on the silver bowl.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Please.

292
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Kamigi Koiran.

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Just think about it.

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Which one?

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Again?

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Increase the number of men who die on the belly?

297
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes.

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Kachai Maura.

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Are you listening?

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The silver bowl.

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll be able to write it beautifully.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Please.

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Please.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you going to the pond?

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes.

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's a strange thing.

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Shall we drink?

308
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oten-to-san.

309
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Tamaka Oiran.

310
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Please.

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Open it.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll give you a blow.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
On top of the fact that he prepared a lot of money,

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
he talked to his parents.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I was asked to make a picture of a horse.

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I said that he was a rare Yoshihara-bom.

317
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I want to give it to him.

318
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I've never heard such a thing from Hasegawa-sama.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He said that he talked to Oiran and Nainai.

320
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And he talked to Joroshu.

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Everyone was excited.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And they gathered money.

323
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Everyone was gathered.

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Please.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Please let me continue.

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're so excited.

327
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Thanks.

328
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So,

329
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we can't give out the money?

330
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Of course.

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We can't give out the money.

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Then,

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
we can do it.

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Right?

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Actually,

336
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm so excited to see you make a book.

337
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Your opinion is good.

338
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You're good at it.

339
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's easier to read.

340
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is that so?

341
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Are you making a book?

342
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No.

343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I think so.

344
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You can't do that.

345
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But,

346
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hasegawa-sama asked me to do it.

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Are you a bookworm?

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No.

349
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You're a real tea-maker.

350
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What are you talking about?

351
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You're not a tea-maker.

352
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If you're a tea-maker,

353
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you're a tea-maker.

354
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll say it,

355
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
but don't say it.

356
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mr. Oyaishi.

357
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Why are you so stubborn?

358
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Everyone, go away.

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This is what I'm doing for Yoshihara.

360
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You're a liar.

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're a liar.

362
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Shut up.

363
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You!

364
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Get out.

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Get out!

366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Mr. Oyaishi.

367
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Mr. Oyaishi.

368
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Are you still here?

369
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Mr. Oyaishi.

370
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This way.

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Good morning, Mr. Okami.

372
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What are you doing here?

373
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm your friend.

374
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you.

375
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'll be back.

376
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This way.

377
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If you take the Tess-D'Art,

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll tell you everything.

379
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes.

380
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What are you doing?

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Are you a bookworm?

382
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No.

383
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm choosing a book.

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Are you going to keep making books?

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If you keep doing this,

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
you'll be a little more stubborn.

387
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's better to be a bookworm than a father.

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's better to make a book for Yoshihara.

389
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But books are just a way to make money.

390
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's why you're calling for a book.

391
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You can't take what's not right for you.

392
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You can't take what's not right for you.

393
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I see.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So,

395
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
if you want a book,

396
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and you want to get it,

397
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
you can't buy it.

398
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There's only one way to get it.

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's to become a friend of Yoshihara.

400
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Then,

401
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
what do you think Yoshihara will do?

402
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You'll make everyone fall for Yoshihara?

403
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes.

404
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
To do that,

405
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
you have to make a book that everyone wants.

406
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do that.

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well,

408
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll have to try.

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I can.

410
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What?

411
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I can do it if I'm a student.

412
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't think so.

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay.

414
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Then,

415
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll choose.

416
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay.

417
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Why did you draw me?

418
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I thought you could draw me.

419
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Draw?

420
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Actually,

421
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I was told to draw 120.

422
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
120?

423
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm a bit confused.

424
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm not sure.

425
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm not sure.

426
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm not sure.

427
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm not sure.

428
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm not sure.

429
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm not sure.

430
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm not sure.

431
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm not sure.

432
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm not sure.

433
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm not sure.

434
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm so confused.

435
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I can't draw many of them.

436
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Anyway,

437
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I only have a few pictures.

438
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm glad you looked into it.

439
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll take the time to draw.

440
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Please.

441
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not about the time.

442
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This is a drawing.

443
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay.

444
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If I draw one of them,

445
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'll draw one more picture.

446
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If I draw one more picture,

447
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'll draw two more pictures.

448
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I think it's not that interesting.

449
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What should I draw?

450
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What kind of book do you want?

451
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What kind of drawing do you want?

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I want everyone who has seen this drawing.

453
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's called the Mitateru.

454
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I see.

455
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
If you can show the drawing,

456
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll draw the Mitateru.

457
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I see.

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's called the Mitateru.

459
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The Mitateru?

460
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yes.

461
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's called the Mitateru.

462
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's a drawing that's popular.

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hmm.

464
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The girl who is in a good mood is

465
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the flower of the wazabi.

466
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh.

467
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The one who doesn't stay at night is

468
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the Hiruga-Od.

469
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The one who doesn't drink is the one who doesn't drink.

470
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That's nice.

471
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I draw only the sea.

472
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I draw a horse.

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That's nice.

474
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I draw a horse.

475
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh.

476
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The horse.

477
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The horse.

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The horse.

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The horse.

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The horse.

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The horse.

482
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh.

483
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The one who doesn't drink is the one who doesn't drink.

484
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
All right.

485
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:13,320
If it is the bunny in the

486
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Shよう

487
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
ok, let' go

488
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Thank you very much.

489
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
How was it?

490
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
I was able to do it on the other hand.

491
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,320
I wonder if the other side is a little bit more serious.

492
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
It's not that bad.

493
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
What?

494
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,320
【I have a good night?】

495
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,320
【Se Ventrilocious?】

496
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,320
【I know HEH!】

497
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
【Morning?!】

498
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,320
【I just can't stop laughing!】

499
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,320
【I'm happy to see you guys, T picked up the bill!】

500
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I did it!

501
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
I did it!

502
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
I did it!

503
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,320
I did it!

504
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Wow!

505
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
I did it!

506
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
I did it!

507
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Oh!

508
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,320
It's like a snowy snow!

509
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
What's wrong, Mr. Tsu?

510
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Well...

511
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
It was really fun.

512
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I was like a mountain to do it.

513
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,320
I didn't even have a sleepover.

514
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,320
But it was fun, even though it was a little bit weird.

515
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,320
It was fun and in the world.

516
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,320
It was in my life.

517
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
It's like...

518
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
I'm in a dream.

519
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Everyone!

520
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Thank you very much!

521
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Thank you.

522
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Mr. Tsu!

523
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,320
This is my new book.

524
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Can you leave it to Mr. Tsu?

525
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
I don't need it.

526
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
I don't want to get involved.

527
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Don't say that.

528
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,320
I'll be happy to have your book.

529
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,320
You can look at it when you're done.

530
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Be quiet!

531
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Here.

532
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Give it to the people who have been involved.

533
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
And then...

534
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Give it to the new acquaintance.

535
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
What do you mean?

536
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Use it as a new guest.

537
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
Well then, let's go.

538
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Yes.

539
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Mr. Tsu!

540
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Yes.

541
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Here you go.

542
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
I'll take this to my house.

543
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Yes.

544
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,320
I'll give it to you so that you can have it as a guest.

545
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Is this house a good book?

546
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
This is amazing!

547
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
You're alive!

548
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Thank you very much.

549
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,320
This is a Japanese book.

550
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,320
If you become a friend of Yoshihara, you can have it.

551
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,320
If you want it, you can go to Yoshihara.

552
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Come on, come on.

553
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Go back to the place where you were.

554
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,320
There are also Kamiyudoko, Chamise, and Izakaya.

555
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,320
The studio is a place where the men of the city, Ali and Arairo,

556
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
have been traveling around Japan.

557
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,320
This is the sample promotion that we are talking about now.

558
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Will the guests come?

559
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
I did what I thought I could.

560
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,320
And there's only Kamida's food.

561
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Hey, what's the point of a bullet-pulled egg?

562
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,320
If you're here, please bring it.

563
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Will you go on with this shitty opinion?

564
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,320
I think you are as good as you can, can you help the Japanese?

565
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Then,

566
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,320
why don't you wait for our son to come and say hi?

567
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,100
He

568
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,480
So about tricks, he only �� judgement.

569
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,280
Why did you do that for me?

570
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,980
I wouldn't eat like this.

571
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,580
The rest of the ladies aren't so dexterous,

572
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,580
who are you to the札?

573
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,900
I'm Softr !

574
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,640

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,820

00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,660
nice to meet you !

577
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,140
You're never worn by the other one...

578
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,320
When you're here,

579
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,620
I'd say I Master Ah boiled the hot stuff down...

580
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,860
I found youAh,

581
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,080

582
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,440
Everybody, I'll tell you a story I don't know you'll like.

583
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,900
I see with those вообще domingoes.

584
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,240
If thatourage hands you ready, I want that.

585
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,880
I think putting them into the shop might seem better.

586
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,760
This, is so cool.

587
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
e

588
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,540
I must release two things

589
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Oh, a smog?

590
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
The flowers are flying.

591
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Kamegiku is a wasabi.

592
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Let's go!

593
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
What's wrong?

594
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Oh my...

595
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Traditional Japaneseuffled Museum

596
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Since they were all intact

597
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Is it true that Shizuya was damaged?

598
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Now we're all part of it

599
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I'm an experienced archer

600
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
The clockwork is a trigger.

601
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,580
Again?

602
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
If you eat it, you'll die.

603
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,580
Well, you've been watching me for so long.

604
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:53,580
You've been watching this town more than anyone else.

605
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,580
That girl...

606
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,580
The clockwork is a trigger.

607
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
And the clockwork is a trigger.

608
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
I'll go.

609
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Look at this trash.

610
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,580
I don't care what you think it is.

611
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
It's okay.

612
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
If it's cheap, we can go too.

613
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,580
I'm curious about the girl around you.

614
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
I've been watching this girl.

615
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Let's go.

616
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
It's like I'm not drinking.

617
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,580
I'm going.

618
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
I did it.

619
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
I did it.

620
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
I did it.

621
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I did it.

622
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
Stop it, you pervert.

623
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Come on, get back.

624
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
You're not going around, are you?

625
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
Are you okay?

626
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,580
Shizuyama's trash is the best.

627
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,580
I'll do my best to help you.

628
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
I'll do my best.

629
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,580
Thank you.

630
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
I'll do my best.

631
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Hasegawa-san, you too?

632
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Yes.

633
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,580
I was so angry that I broke the house I left behind.

634
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
I can't stand it anymore.

635
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,580
I'll have to pay you back someday.

636
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,580
But if you know the truth, you might say,

637
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,580
I'll pay you back.

638
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,580
You're the man who made the lyrics of Yoshibara in 50 seconds.

639
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,580
You're a living creature.

640
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,580
That's true. That's the best.

641
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,580
The girls who were standing in the flower are taking the snot.

642
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Yoshibara started to take the light.

643
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,580
But on the other side...

644
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,580
The dark boy is rising.

645
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Rising.

646
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
The light is gone.

647
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
The light is gone.

648
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
The light is gone.

649
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
The light is gone.

650
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
The light is gone.

651
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
The light is gone.

652
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
The light is gone.

653
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
The light is gone.

654
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,580
The light is gone.

655
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
The light is gone.

656
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
The light is gone.

657
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580
The light is gone.

658
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,580
The light is gone.

659
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
The light is gone.

660
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
The light is gone.

661
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,580
The light is gone.
