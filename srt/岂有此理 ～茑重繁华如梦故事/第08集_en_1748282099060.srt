Episode 1

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I hope the Juzo's re-enactment goes well.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, Hananoi!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Juzo!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's that black thing?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's inside the black thing?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Nothing.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's sold out.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sold out?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Give me 100!

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Give me 100!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Give me one!

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
30! No, 50!

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
50!

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey!

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're doing well.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Everyone's getting more and more excited.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They're getting more and more excited.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If things keep going like this,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll have to make tea for you.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you, Inari-san.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Huh?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's just because the bookstore is excited, right?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not like it's sold out to the people in town.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I thought you'd be happy,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so I came to tell you.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I...

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I think I should be helping you as much as I can.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Helping?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll have a lot of people come to see you.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll make them want to see you again as a memory.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll give them the will to do so.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't push yourself.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, good morning.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How was the recital?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, thanks to you,

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was able to sort everything out.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Did you hear anything about the Urokogataya?

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, not at all.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I see.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I see.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I see.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I see.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I see.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I see.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I see.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I see.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I see.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is it?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think he was worried.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He said the Urokogataya was in trouble.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He said he was given 2,800 books and half of the savings.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, it was all thanks to you.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I lived very lightly.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
By the way, have you already seen this?

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
A magaki flower?

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a recital from the studio.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Urokogataya is in the middle of a crisis.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:34,700
Urokogataya, that's the

65
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

66
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Please take a look.

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
It's not that bad.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I know.

69
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
I'm not going to lose.

70
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Re-Cital, Re-Cital.

71
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700
The New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
What's going on?

73
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,700
The New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
The New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,700
This is the New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,700
But, the new magaki flower is...

77
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,700
It's a surprise that you can buy 2 books with one book.

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
Re-Cital, Re-Cital.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
The New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,700
And, the famous Segawa is famous.

81
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
The only one who has Segawa is me.

82
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,700
The recital of the studio, magaki flower, has become more than twice as popular as it was announced.

83
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
It's Segawa.

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
It's really Segawa.

85
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,700
The rubber of the sales, the street crab.

86
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
It's really Segawa.

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
It's really Segawa.

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
It's really Segawa.

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
The studio sells the recital and Segawa brings the guests.

90
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,700
The two became the leading actors of the New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

91
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,700
The New Yoshihara Re-Cital.

92

From now on, you're the leader of the Jihon-don and the Koshodou.

My butt is itchy.

Don't worry.

170

You're the leader of the Jihon-don and the Koshodou.

171

You're the leader.

172
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,700
I can't believe I can be the Jihon-don and the Koshodou.

173
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Sorry.

174
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Never mind.

175
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
It's all thanks to my parents for raising me until today.

176
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Come on.

177
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Are you trying to sell me a sword?

178
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Sorry.

179
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700

Thank you.

182
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,700
You've been really drunk, Koshodou.

183
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Stop it, Okami.

184
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm sure everyone is happy.

185
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,700
I'm sure Yoshihara didn't think he could be the leader of the Jihon-don.

186
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,700
From now on, you can count on me.

187
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Welcome.

188
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,700
I heard you have a secret weapon to meet Segawa.

189
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I'll give you any amount of money you want.

190
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
I've prepared it.

191
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I don't want to.

192
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I don't know much about secret weapons.

194
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
You're kidding.

195
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
There are other good people besides Segawa.

196
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Did you sleep with Segawa?

197
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
A little.

198
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
What?

199
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
He's a little stubborn.

200
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Segawa?

201
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Segawa.

202
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
He's stubborn?

203
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
No way.

204
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Segawa is amazing.

205
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Brother.

206
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Mr. Gennai.

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
I'm here to see you.

208
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Thank you for coming.

209
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
You two are here today?

210
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Yes.

211
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm Segawa.

212
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
What kind of girl is she?

213
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
What kind of girl?

214
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
She's a flower.

215
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
What?

216
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Let's go.

217
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Which one is next?

218
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
The young man in Ozu.

219
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,700
He'll show his face to the camera.

220
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Then he'll go back to the camera and send it.

221
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
After that, he'll go back to the young man's seat.

222
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I'm going in.

223
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
The seats are too crowded.

224
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
You can't see him?

225
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Shin.

227
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I want to see you.

228
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
I want you to go up.

229
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
It's a little too much for a man.

230
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I can't stand the way he's acting.

232
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I'll go.

233
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
He's a tough guy.

234
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Everyone is here to see Segawa.

235
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
He's not here for the reunion.

236
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,700
He's here because he's here for Segawa.

237
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,700
I sometimes wonder what I should do to get back at him.

238
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Does Juzo fall in love with someone?

239
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
No one is cute or in love with anyone.

240
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
That's the kind of man he is.

241
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,700
How about you take over Segawa?

242
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Take over?

243
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,700
Taking over is when a woman takes over the man.

244
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,700
In many cases, she becomes the wife or husband of the man.

245
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
That's the man's happiness.

246
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
There's no way you can do that.

247
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
How much does it cost to take over?

248
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,700
No matter how cheap it is, it's 100 or 200.

249
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Segawa is a thousand-ryo garden.

250
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
That much?

251
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,700
But I never thought about it when I was little.

252
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
When I was little?

253
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
I thought we'd be together when I grew up.

254
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,700
I once dropped the net that he was keeping as a treasure in the well.

255
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
No.

256
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
I won't give up.

257
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
I won't give up.

258
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I have to go back soon.

259
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I'll go to my parents.

260
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
You're so big.

261
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
You're eating too much banana.

262
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
That's what happened.

263
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
I'm going to eat a lot.

264
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,700
By the way, what kind of woman do you fall in love with?

265
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
What kind of woman have you fallen in love with so far?

266
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
That's not it.

267
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Have you ever fallen in love with a woman in a situation like this?

268
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
The man who loves you will be taken away by your heart.

269
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,700
The woman will be beaten to death.

270
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,700
I've never thought of someone who would take you for someone else.

271
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
It's a boring story.

272
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
That's right.

273
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
That's right.

274
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm not a

275
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I'm not a

276
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
It's a mess.

277
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I'm not a

278
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I'm not a

279
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
I'm not a

280
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm not a

281
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm not a

282
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm not a

283
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm not a

284
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I'm not a

285
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm not a

286
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
I'm not a

287
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm not a

288
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
It's sold out.

289
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Send it to the public.

290
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Everyone is getting more and more.

291
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Is the Sumino sword starting to turn well?

292
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Thanks to you.

293
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Are you preparing for the production?

294
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
I was told that I would be a white-eyed idiot.

295
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I prepared a bug.

296
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
I'm going to say that there are various rules.

297
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,280
It's just a stupid thing to have a bow.

298
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
The other day.

299
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
I read the famous stone called Seigawa in Yoshihara.

300
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I was a little surprised to see the road.

301
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I was a little surprised to see the road.

302
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I like it, but it's a good thing for Tamikusa.

303
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Make an asset a show and make money.

304
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,280
It's easy to build a house with this.

305
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
If you use the money well, you can also make a chance for the two sides.

306
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm not a

307
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Hey, Seigawa.

308
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm still sleeping.

309
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I see.

310
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
The guest yesterday was a big Tsuyo.

311
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Tsuyo

312
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Why are you wearing such a guest?

313
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
It hurts.

314
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
You've seen it in your dreams.

315
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Wait a minute.

316
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Who is the one who is doing the same thing?

317
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
It's the first time I've ever been a child.

318
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
But he's busier than anyone else.

319
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Please don't wear such a guest.

320
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Then you don't care if it's me?

321
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
No.

322
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
You don't care if it's a snake?

323
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
If it's not Seigawa, it's okay.

324
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Someone has to deal with it.

325
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Stop it.

326
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Show me.

327
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
That's it.

328
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,280
It's a self-sacrifice to raise your own hand.

329
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I want you to be the only one who knows that.

330
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Is the other Joro handling the guests who came to see Seigawa?

331
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Yes.

332
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
It's a game that takes up the Joro, who is familiar enough.

333
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
What?

334
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Hey.

335
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
What?

336
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Hey.

337
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Is that Seigawa?

338
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
It's Matsunoi.

339
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
So it's a Chihiro.

340
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,280
And I'm like a mountain who came to see Seigawa.

341
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
It's a problem that there are no guests.

342
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
It's a problem that I came, but it's a problem.

343
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm going to be rewarded for being a Joro.

344
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Isn't that a Miu family?

345
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
It's Miu-kyu-ori Mabu.

346
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:53,960
Mabu is a work of the

347
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I'm going to go in.

348
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Today's lunch is yesterday's dinner.

349
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,280
I'll treat you to two first-time guests and a familiar flower garden.

350
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Good.

351
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm going to go in.

352
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Let's roll the scales first.

353
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
So you don't seem to be selling much?

354
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,280
No, this will definitely get a lot of attention.

355
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:18,180
Therefore, the top of the book is in a row, and the

356
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:23,180
Let's all think that this book is not something anyone can make.

357
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,180
What should be taken care of is a scale-shaped shop.

358
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,180
It's not a YOSHIWARA book store or anything.

359
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:57,180
I'm back, but I'm not open yet.

360
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:04,180
I heard that I was the one who sold the Uroku-gataya's lunch.

361
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,180
The one who betrayed me was a samurai who was holding hands.

362
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,180
I chased all the nails in the Uroku-gataya and ran away.

363
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
The samurai?

364
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Yes.

365
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Why did you talk about that?

366
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:28,180
This story was told by me.

367
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Is that so?

368
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,180
I'm going to get back at you for this.

369
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:46,180
I'm going to get back at you for this.

370
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,180
Because the book was coming from the hair?

371
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Yes, the bookstores in Edo were only this Suwara and Uroku-gataya.

372
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:05,180
You may not be interested, but I couldn't help you.

373
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
No.

374
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,180
I didn't want to be crushed by the Uroku-gataya.

375
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
Really?

376
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,180
Yes.

377
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
What are you here for today?

378
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,180
I'd like to consult a book.

379
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Consult a book?

380
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I'd like to send a book to a certain Joroh.

381
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
I see.

382
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,180
Listen, today's book is a book about the Kengyo, the Toriyama Kengyo.

383
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Is Kengyo a different name?

384
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,180
Yes, it's the name of the owner of the restaurant.

385
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,180
At that time, the samurai were suffering from the evil of the government and the court.

386
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:02,180
In addition, some people were recognized as the king of the Kengyo and were proud of their wealth.

387
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,180
I don't like the food.

388
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,180
I don't have any rivals.

389
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
The next life is hell.

390
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,180
I also had a side that was hated.

391
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,180
But that's a lowly thing.

392
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,180
Listen, the Kengyo is at the top of the restaurant.

393
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,180
I'm asking you not to have any rivals.

394
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:37,180
Everyone thinks that the mountain of money is sitting.

395
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Have a nice day.

396
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
Have a nice day.

397
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Welcome back.

398
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
I'm sorry I'm always late.

399
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,180
Brother is reading a book?

400
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
What are you reading?

401
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
I read this, Juzo.

402
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Oh, my.

403
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
A friend of the shami told me.

404
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
This is interesting.

405
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,180
I don't know.

406
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
It's a book.

407
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
I'm back.

408
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
I'm sorry.

409
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,180
I didn't mean to surprise you.

410
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,180
How do you know that you were surprised?

411
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
I heard a sound.

412
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,180
I can understand most of the things by the sound of footsteps and the sound of the dog.

413
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
Hey.

414
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
I brought this.

415
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,180
This is gorgeous.

416
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
What's this book?

417
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,180
I'm just sitting.

418
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
It's boring.

419
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,180
Fortunately, I'm eating.

420
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
Don't worry.

421
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Everyone should enjoy it.

422
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Thank you for your kind heart.

423
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,180
Show me.

424
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
It's beautiful.

425
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
It's beautiful.

426
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,180
If you don't mind, I'll read a book.

427
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,180
But it will break the tradition.

428
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,180
It's always the first time I enjoy myself.

429
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
I see.

430
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
You enjoy the voice instead.

431
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,180
You don't have to be so polite.

432
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Well, I'm just thanking you.

433
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Thank you.

434
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,180
The book on life

435
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,180
Raise like an upheaval,

436
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,180
I'm flattered with joy

437
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Truly normal

438
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:19,180
The movie of the life of Dr. Kinkin and the dream of the simple pillow

439
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,680
are both the same age.

440
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,180
Dr. Kinkin tells us what kind of people they are.

441
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:34,180
This is a dream story that a young man in a village saw while he was singing.

442
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,180
The story was usually well-established,

443
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,680
but the actions and words of the people drawn there,

444
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,680
the wind tribe was very realistic and a revolutionary reading.

445
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,680
The appearance of the husband is amazing.

446
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
You are doing well, aren't you?

447
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,680
You seem to have seen the Tonsuki of Niro Town.

448
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
That's right.

449
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I've seen it.

450
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
What?

451
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Could it be...

452
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Is this about my eyes?

453
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Yes.

454
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Look, look.

455
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
It's a girl.

456
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
It's a girl.

457
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
It's a girl.

458
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
It's a girl.

459
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
But you didn't make this, did you?

460
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
You didn't, did you?

461
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I heard that the Urokogataya made a lot of books.

462
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
What?

463
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Oh, that's right.

464
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Urokogataya.

465
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Then, your friends...

466
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Urokogataya

467
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Juzo!

468
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Oh!

469
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Did you see this?

470
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Yes.

471
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
How was it?

472
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,680
I thought the blue book was interesting for the first time.

473
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
I know.

474
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I read it in a flash.

475
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Did you bring the Urokogataya back so soon?

476
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Can't you keep your promise to your friends?

477
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Calm down.

478
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
If you're talking nonsense, I'll kill you.

479
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Calm down.

480
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
It's not the time to talk nonsense.

481
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,680
You should talk to your parents.

482
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
My parents?

483
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Are they going to talk to me?

484
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Yes.

485
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,680
From now on, you and Hony should get along.

486
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Oh, that's right.

487
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Then we'll have a good talk.

488
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,680
If you say yes, I'll give you a good advice.

489
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,680
I'm so hungry.

490
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm not tired of it.

491
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
What's wrong?

492
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Oh, I can rely on you.

493
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,680
All the old men in Ogiya are all going to be in the Yoshiwara family.

494
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,680
They're all going to be in the Yoshiwara family.

495
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
You're a fool.

496
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm glad.

497
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,680
I'm thinking of doing something about the Yoshiwara family.

498
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,680
It means we're not alone anymore.

499
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
That's right.

500
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,680
We have more friends.

501
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,680
It's a grateful story.

502
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
It's all thanks to you.

503
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,680
You've helped me so far.

504
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,680
My parents are like this.

505
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Thank you.

506
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,680
I didn't do it to help you.

507
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Hey.

508
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
What's that?

509
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
This.

510
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Can I have it?

511
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,680
I want you to be happy.

512
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Happy?

513
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Yeah.

514
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
I want you to be accepted.

515
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,680
I want you to be a good son-in-law of the famous samurai.

516
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I think you can do it.

517
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,680
The Jorohs suffer without knowing the world.

518
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,680
It's said that they're driven out of it.

519
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,680
It's good to read this so that it doesn't happen.

520
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,680
I'm a Joroh for the officer.

521
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,680
There's a mountain in Yoshiwara.

522
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I want to save you.

523
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,680
I want you to be happy.

524
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I've been with you since I was a kid.

525
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,680
I want to repay you from the bottom of my heart.

526
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
It's ridiculous.

527
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Thank you.

528
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,680
I want you to be a good son-in-law.

529
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Is he angry?

530
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Idiot!

531
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,680
You hit your head on the tofu corner and you die.

532
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Did I do something?

533
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,680
You're a bad guy.

534
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I'm sorry.

535
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Storage.

536
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Boss.

537
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,260
I will cook for you with a Holy amigos

538
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
I'm glad to hear that.

539
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,260
It's been a while.

540
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
I'm glad you're here.

541
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Yes.

542
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,260
I'm sorry for the sudden crowd, but can we talk?

543
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Yes.

544
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Yes.

545
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,260
They came to refuse to come in?

546
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Yes.

547
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,260
The owner is trying to bring it in.

548
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Well, let's have a drink first.

549
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,260
Everyone, let's have a drink.

550
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
Tsuriyama-san.

551
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Please don't mind.

552
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,260
Nishimura-san is not here today.

553
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,260
I'm not going to drink.

554
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
Well, let's not talk about that.

555
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
I'll bring this today.

556
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,260
If a woman and a man get into the well in Kojima,

557
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
they will be able to escape.

558
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,260
You're a man of your word.

559
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
I see.

560
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Well, then,

561
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,260
can we get to the point?

562
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Actually, this time,

563
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,260
we have a blue book like this.

564
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
It is well-known,

565
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,260
and the customers are crowded at the store.

566
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
From now on,

567
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
we will continue to work hard as a bookstore.

568
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,260
We want to support the shop with a long-term relationship

569
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,260
as much as possible.

570
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,260
That's what my friends want.

571
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
I'm sorry,

572
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,260
but I didn't talk about the friendship of Ko Shodou-san.

573
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,260
I think that only those involved in Yoshiwara will be given.

574
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
A blue book like the one the shopkeeper gives,

575
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
a playbook,

576
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
and no other items.

577
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Can you prevent the book from falling

578
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,260
because of the number of books you are keeping?

579
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
I wonder.

580
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,260
Can you add me to your team with that decision?

581
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
But,

582
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,260
I'm a bookseller.

583
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
How about making a bookseller here

584
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
and giving it to you for free?

585
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,260
What?

586
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Then, as it was originally,

587
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,260
everything will be sold.

588
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
But,

589
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
really?

590
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
Then,

591
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,260
I don't have to think about it.

592
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
It's a story that's been made too much.

593
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,260
Let's continue the story.

594
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
I understand.

595
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
From now on,

596
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,260
can I talk to you alone?

597
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,260
There are stories that are also shared

598
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
and that I understand.

599
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,260
That's what I'm saying.

600
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,260
It seems that you have thought about

601
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,260
a story that has a lot of benefits.

602
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
In this world,

603
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
there are things that move with money

604
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
and things that don't move.

605
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,260
What do you mean?

606
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I can't tell you the name,

607
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
but there are still people who say that

608
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Yoshiwara Gate will be added to the team.

609
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
What is that?

610
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Yoshiwara Gate is a strange place,

611
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
but there are people who want

612
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,260
to have nothing to do with the city.

613
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
What are you talking about?

614
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
The Japanese you are touching

615
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,260
are originally from Yoshiwara, aren't they?

616
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Yes.

617
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Originally,

618
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
we are the land of Yoshiwara Gate.

619
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
I said that too,

620
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
but I thought that if we didn't need

621
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
such a strange thing in Edo,

622
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
we would have been kicked out of the city.

623
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

624
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
I said that,

625
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,260
but if we let the god of death

626
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,260
step on the soil of the city

627
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,260
that the god of death chased,

628
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
we will be against the god.

629
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,260
I don't think

630
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,260
women will buy such people.

631
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,260
I don't know.

632
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,260
I don't think so.

633
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Excuse me.

634
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
I'd like to talk to the masters

635
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
who are living in Yoshiwara.

636
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
We are really stupid.

637
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,260
In order to understand,

638
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,260
we have to talk and have a relationship.

639
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Please.

640
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,260
I also said that

641
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,260
I would try it,

642
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
but everyone,

643
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,260
I don't want to be in the same position

644
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,260
as the people of Yoshiwara.

645
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,260
Please.

646
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Good night.

647
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
Father, no!

648
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
You're lying!

649
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,260
He's a fake!

650
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,260
You're lying!

651
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,260
No!

652
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,260
I'm sorry!

653
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,260
I'm sorry!

654
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,260
I'm sorry.

655
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,260
I'm sorry,

656
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,260
but I'm not in the same position

657
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
as the people of Yoshiwara.

658
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,260
No!

659
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,260
You guys!

660
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Father!

661
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
That means

662
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,260
you can't make a Yoshiwara book anymore!

663
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,260
Oh my!

664
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
So now you can only make 10 books?

665
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
You can just pass the gate quietly.

666
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Think!

667
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,260
That's right.

668
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,260
I can't go out again.

669
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I'm going to kill you.

670
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
Prepare yourself, you little brat!

671
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
I heard that the Sega's reception is going to be decided.

672
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,260
What?

673
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,260
I'm talking about the reception.

674
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,260
Do I have that feeling?

675
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,260
What is this?

676
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,260
Are you going to be a play?

677
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
I'm going to kick you out!

678
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,260
Please, don't go.

679
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,260
I'm not going to change my mind.

680
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Of course not!
