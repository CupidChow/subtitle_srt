00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There he is!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mishima!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Did you get him?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No, it wasn't me!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, Tachibu!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Don't think you can get away with this!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll make you regret it!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Nureteni Awamochi

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I tried making a potamochi with a potamochi from a shelf.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It means that I was blessed with a brilliant story.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I hope you'll appreciate it.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a gift for the one who dropped the potamochi.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nureteni Awamochi

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll appreciate it.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's a rock.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I wonder what it's going to be like.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I didn't expect to come to the Ministry of the Arts.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's because the people of Osaka want to be punished severely.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What do you mean?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's just a fake.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The shop said that they should have finished the job.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's a pretty flashy thing to do.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But what will happen if you get punished severely?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The shop is down.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think it's over.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're a stupid man.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is there anyone who wants to get a retrial in place of a shop?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to be the one to do it.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've done it before.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Really?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll do it.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll be the one to do it.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll go to Yoshiwara and show you the statue.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's...

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Excuse me.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Tsutaya Juzaburo is coming.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please let him in.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Please.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Please.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Please.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Please.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Please.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Please.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Please.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Please.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Please.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Please.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Please.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Please.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,420
Next, I invited one of the joggers

101
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,820
Why are you so eager for me?

102
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,540
In my opinion

103
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,980
It's fun to be friends with the joggers

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,080
time, money and conversations

105
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,320
Hello

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,640
Sorry to bother you

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,340
Come in

108
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,340
You can't do it without messing around, Tsutanshu.

109
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
But it's not important.

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,340
From now on, I'll give you a retrial and you'll have to continue.

111
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Thank you for your consideration.

112
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,340
But from now on, I'll be the one to give you a retrial.

113
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,340
I think you said before that only those among your friends can be retrialists.

114
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,340
So, can you give me to your friend?

115
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,340
I think the reason why you're giving me a retrial is to prevent the number of copies from increasing too much.

116
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,340
It's hard for a scales-type shopkeeper to take it back.

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Then, I'll give you a retrial.

118
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,340
Even if you give me to your friend, I can't give it to you.

119
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Tsutanshu, you're really a bad guy.

120
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,340
It's not like you're selling your goods at Yoshihara's house.

121
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,340
You think you can easily become a bookseller.

122
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,340
You're a bastard to attack me when you don't have your master.

123
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,340
If you leave it to me, I'll make a double retrial.

124
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
Double.

125
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Yes.

126
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,340
Then, you'll be able to do it too.

127
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
This isn't a bad deal, is it?

128
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,340
I can do it.

129
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
I see.

130
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Then, first of all, let me see the retrial called double.

131
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,340
If it's really double, then how about you give it to your friend?

132
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
I understand.

133
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,340
I'll make a retrial that you think will sell twice as much.

134
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,340
Tsuruya-san, what are you going to do if you really do it?

135
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
I'm not going to put things in here.

137
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,340
In the first place, double is not going to sell.

138
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
There's no way.

139
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:01,340
And there's a way to make a good retrial so that the studio's retrial doesn't sell.

140
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,340
What do you think, Nishimura-san?

141
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:31,340
In other words, if your retrial sells twice as much, you'll be able to put it in the studio's studio's friend?

142
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,340
Yes.

143
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,340
I've made up that story, so I want you to buy it twice as much as your father.

144
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
You bastard.

145
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
You're doing something selfish again.

146
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
You bastard.

147
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
You're doing something selfish again.

148
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
I told you to stop.

149
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
I thought it was not going to happen again.

150
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
Not again?

151
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Yes.

152
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,340
If I can admit it to my friends, I can make a good retrial.

153
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Then I can sell the books I made at the bank and the goods I bought at the shop.

154
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,340
So you're going to sell all of Yoshiwara?

155
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
Exactly.

156
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I found it.

157
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
Thank you.

158
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Isn't it interesting?

159
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,340
You've become a big hit so far.

160
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,340
If this goes well, the Shichu guys will admit us.

161
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
Such a plot.

162
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Is it okay to take it in time?

163
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Alright.

164
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Alright.

165
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:23,340
So I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you.

166
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,340
I couldn't help but do it.

167
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
You bastard.

168
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,340
You're going to blame the samurai?

169
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
You're going to blame me?

170
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,340
But we're sorry for the trouble we caused you.

171
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,340
From now on, you have to be strict with Kanegure.

172
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
What?

173
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,340
You're not going to give me the trial of the retrial?

174
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
I'll pay you a high price.

175
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,340
I'm sorry to hear that, but what do you want to say to your husband?

176
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,340
I'll talk to the scales shop.

177
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
I can't decide without my husband.

179
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
I have no choice.

180
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,340
The scales shop is going to be a mess.

181
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
That's a shame.

182
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Juzo.

184
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,340
You're a normal soldier.

185
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,340
I knew about the scales shop.

186
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
What?

187
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,340
I knew you were investigating, so I didn't say anything.

188
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,340
I'm like a man who's got a lot of scales.

189
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:54,340
What I can do now is make a good retrial that looks good on Hametani.

190
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
What's going on?

191
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
I don't know.

192
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Stop it.

193
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,340
You're so mean.

194
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Juzo.

195
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
What are you doing?

196
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,340
I'm trying to get the retrial to be half-baked.

197
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,340
Half-baked?

198
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,340
If the retrial is sold twice, it will be recognized as half-baked.

199
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
I didn't say that.

200
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:35,340
In order to sell it twice, you have to line up the number of times in the bookshop.

201
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:44,340
If you put the same amount of money as before, you can line up the number of times in the bookshop.

202
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,340
You're a writer.

203
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,340
But do you make money by selling it half-baked?

204
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
No.

205
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,340
So you have to make it half-baked.

206
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Do you make it with a half-baked?

207
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
No.

208
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,340
I make it with a better one than this.

209
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
A better one?

210
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,340
I'll ask you two to help me.

211
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Please come in.

212
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
How can you make a better retrial?

213
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
That's right.

214
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
It's hard to use here.

215
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,340
I wish it would be like this.

216
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
How do you buy a retrial?

217
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I just want it.

218
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Don't be stupid.

219
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,340
I don't even look for a simple one.

220
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't know.

221
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
I got it.

222
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,340
You can make a good retrial with that retrial?

223
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,340
That's good.

224
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
How is it?

225
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Do you think it will be useful?

226
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,340
The one with the frog is not on it.

227
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
The one with the retrial is only on the big store.

228
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
The one with the pen is not on it.

229
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
I see.

230
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
This is a good one.

231
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
Is the front of the man free?

232
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Kaori.

233
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,340
If the song you brought recently is the front of the man, it's free.

234
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,340
If you do that, the front of the man will be rubbed and the song you bought recently will be very popular.

235
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,340
The studio guy.

236
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Thank you for thinking about it.

237
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
But you should talk to me.

238
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
Who?

239
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
Kaori.

240
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
I knew it when I first saw it.

241
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
The studio is a relationship between Mr. Matsuya and me.

242
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
I see.

243
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
I see.

244
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
Don't be silent.

245
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
Please help me.

246
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
Kaori, get away.

247
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Kaori.

248
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
What are you doing?

249
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
You're a womanizer.

250
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,340
Calm down.

251
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
No.

252
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Kaori, get away.

253
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
No.

254
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
Are you okay?

255
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,340
If you don't get away, you'll get a scratch on the face of the studio.

256
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,340
Let's go.

257
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
Hurry up.

258
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Studio, there's a delivery man waiting for you.

259
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
What's his name?

260
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
His name is Kaori.

261
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
He's dangerous.

262
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Welcome back.

263
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
Mr. Shinnosuke.

264
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Welcome.

265
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
You're not going to see Usumi today?

266
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
No.

267
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
This is it.

268
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,340
Okay.

269
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
You said you wanted to do re-signals.

270
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,340
Oh, that's right.

271
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
What's wrong?

272
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Is there something wrong?

273
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,340
It's a little thinner.

274
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
Thinner?

275
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,340
When you put it in the thickest place in this heat, it's not going to get stuck.

276
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Thinner?

277
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Hattori, where's the delivery man?

278
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
I don't know.

279
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,340
If it's thinner, it'll fit better.

280
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,340
I think I can walk Yoshiwara with this in one hand.

281
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,340
This is it.

282
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,340
They say that they used to carry a re-signal and paint the Joro.

283
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,340
That's an old thought.

284
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
No, I'll go.

285
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,340
A re-signal that can be carried thin.

286
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,340
This can be used as a hook.

287
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Mr. Shin.

288
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Yes.

289
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Can you help me with one thing?

290
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
I'll pay you to meet me at the office.

291
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
I heard you were on the run.

292
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Leave it to me.

293
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
I don't mind.

294
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,340
First, we'll look for a place to put the re-signal on.

295
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,340
This.

296
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Can't you arrange it in the same way as the real store?

297
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
Please leave it as it is.

298
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Please come from the left.

299
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
What?

300
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,340
You're going to start a re-signal from scratch?

301
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,340
That's a lot of work.

302
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,340
You can't be that bossy.

303
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
I can't go.

304
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Try to get the Jiro to join the gang.

305
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,340
We can't get the Jiro to come out.

306
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
I'll get the re-signal now.

307
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,340
Only I can handle the Jiro.

308
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Is there anything I can do?

309
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm not sure.

310
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,340
By the way, is there another man who has the re-signal?

311
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
This is it.

312
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
This poor re-signal.

313
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
This is it.

314
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,340
This poor re-signal from Asakusa.

315
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,340
I know that one of the boxes is the fifth one.

316
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Do you have a fifth one in this situation?

317
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,340
I'll have to re-signalize the whole store.

318
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,340
I'll have to re-signalize the whole store.

319
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
20 boxes will be a lot of work.

320
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Only 20 boxes?

321
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
How many have you done recently?

322
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,340
I make the teeth bigger and make them thinner.

323
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,340
You can't take on the job.

324
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
You're a loser.

325
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Get out of here.

326
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
I understand.

327
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
How about a big party with Yoshio?

328
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Thank you.

329
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,340
I've been wondering.

330
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,340
Can Tsutajyuu accept the party for free?

331
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
No, no, no.

332
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
I can't just let him do it.

333
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
But if it's sold twice,

334
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,340
I can make the craftsmen feel better.

335
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,340
But then Tsutajyuu won't make any money?

336
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Well,

337
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,340
if you ask me to play with Fukagawa and Shinagawa,

338
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,340
I'll tell you if it's Yoshio.

339
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,340
It's like a night in the city.

340
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
I feel like Yoshio in Tsutajyuu.

341
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Chieza!

342
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
Welcome back.

343
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,340
My father said to come upstairs.

344
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
What?

345
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,340
I'm going.

346
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Okay.

347
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Okay.

348
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,340
You're going to put Chieza's reenactment behind Nishimura?

349
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,340
Yes.

350
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,340
And Chieza will come back.

351
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,340
So I asked everyone to come.

352
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Chieza isn't your friend, is he?

353
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,340
He's a carpenter in Asakusa.

354
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,340
So he's going to come with me.

355
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,340
That's strange.

356
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,340
I was told that I'm not a carpenter because I have a destiny.

357
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
That's right.

358
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:42,340
But there are many questions about whether Tsutajyuu can make a proper reenactment.

359
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,340
I was asked by my friends.

360
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,340
This is the only way to allow this.

361
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Well...

362
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,340
You were asked by your friends?

363
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Well, I'm sure everyone will be able to reenact it.

364
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,340
So you're going to make Tsutajyuu do it twice?

365
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Yes.

366
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Tsutajyuu,

367
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,340
why don't you come here and do it with us?

368
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,340
You're not going to let a carpenter like us work in a book store?

369
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,340
I refuse.

370
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,340
If it's sold twice, I'll have my friends do it.

371
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,340
So I'll sell it twice and have my friends do it.

372
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Is that so?

373
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,340
Yes.

374
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,340
Well, everyone,

375
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,340
I'll leave you to it.

376
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,340
Boss,

377
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,340
what kind of threat did he put on you?

378
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,340
The carpenter who bought your reenactment

379
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,340
doesn't use it for his own business.

380
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,340
Is that so?

381
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Then I'll make something that will replace it.

382
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
What?

383
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
Well then.

384
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Did you hear me?

385
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,340
If this happens, I won't be able to handle your reenactment.

386
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I won't sell it twice.

387
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
You can't be a carpenter.

388
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
That's what he said.

389
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,340
He doesn't think about Yoshihara at all.

390
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,340
His aim is to enter the silver market.

391
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
If you're going to enter the silver market,

392
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
you won't be able to do anything.

393
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,340
You can take out your hands and money.

394
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,340
You can build a shop with that book.

395
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,340
You can erase all your thoughts.

396
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,340
It's just easy and profitable.

397
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:18,340
But think about it.

398
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,340
The money they spend

399
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,340
is the money the carpenter earned by hurting his body.

400
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,340
Why do you have to do that for a carpenter like you?

401
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,340
If you're going to keep the money

402
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,340
that the carpenter's blood and tears have bled,

403
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
you want to make a picture with that money,

404
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
a book, and a reenactment

405
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,340
so that the customers can see the carpenter.

406
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,340
You want to make customers choose from among them.

407
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,340
The woman of Yoshihara is a good woman.

408
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,340
You want to make her the best in Edo.

409
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,340
You want to make her feel proud.

410
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,340
That's the only way to protect yourself

411
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,340
from the women who are eating in the street.

412
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,340
That's why you can't leave it to others.

413
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,340
You have to keep the book that Yoshihara used to sell.

414
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
You have to keep the book that Yoshihara used to sell.

415
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Now you have to keep it.

416
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Everyone,

417
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,340
don't be afraid of the boring threats.

418
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Fight together.

419
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,080
The

420
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,340
carpenter said that.

421
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,340
He said that he wanted to make us proud

422
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,340
because he was the only one who could protect us.

423
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,340
He said that he wanted to make us fight together.

424
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,340
He was really angry.

425
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,340
What do you mean by fighting?

426
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,340
If you don't sell the book twice, you can't get your friends to buy it.

427
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,340
Then, the enemy of Nishimura came to the shop.

428
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Nishimura is a very dead end.

429
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Do you think Juzan will win?

430
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Hmm.

431
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,340
I'll think about it.

432
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Let's sell the book twice.

433
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Yes.

434
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,340
I'll do it.

435
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,340
Leave the hand to me.

436
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,340
The contents are fine.

437
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,340
I'll ask you again.

438
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,340
No, Mr. Nishimura.

439
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,340
I'm determined.

440
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,340
I didn't think Tsutajirou was so easy.

441
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Me too.

442
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Nishimura came out.

443
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,340
I want to make a decision.

444
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,340
I want to make a decision.

445
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,340
I want to make a decision.

446
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,340
I think it's enough.

447
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,340
I want to make a decision.

448
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,340
More than this?

449
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,340
If there are people who buy books,

450
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,340
I think it's a big store.

451
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,340
I'll put everything in the cash store.

452
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
Do you give up?

453
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
I'll put everything in.

454
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,340
It's too much.

455
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
It's too much.

456
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,340
I'll make a decision.

457
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,340
I'll do it.

458
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,340
Let's look back at the book.

459
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,340
Thank you very much.

460
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,340
I'll do it.

461
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
Then, a few days later.

462
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:22,340
Tsutajirou brought a few books to the small cash store.

463
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
Tsutajirou.

464
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,340
I'll put it in again.

465
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,340
Please put this in.

466
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,340
If you put it in like this, you'll get a large price.

467
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
It's important to put it in.

468
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Do you want me to start over?

469
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Please.

470
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
I'll do it.

471
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,340
To put all the stores and the money in the cash store.

472
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Every day.

473
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,340
I'm Juzaburo.

474
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,340
I'm back.

475
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
I'm done.

476
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,340
Please give me this.

477
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
What are you doing?

479
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,340
Please give me this.

480
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,340
I'm sorry.

483
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm sorry.

484
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Don't be so hard on me.

485
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
Good morning.

486
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,340
This is the second time we've met.

487
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Repeating the days.

488
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Repeating.

489
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Please.

490
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
This is the last time.

491
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
I'm sorry.

492
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,340
I'll do it.

493
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
I'm sorry.

494
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Repeating.

495
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
This is not enough.

496
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Please take good care of me.

502
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
I'm Yoshihara.

503
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
I'm Yoshihara.

504
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,340
Repeating is a special skill.

505
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,340
It's the same as riding a bike.

506
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
What's wrong?

507
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,340
I've seen it.

508
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Repeating is stupid.

509
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,340
When the end of the life is decided.

510
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,340
When the end of the life is decided.

511
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,340
It was a success.

512
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,340
It was a success.

513
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,340
When the fourth generation of Someginu was born.

514
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
Then.

515
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,340
It's a little small.

516
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
I'm sorry.

517
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
I hate him.

518
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,340
I hate him.

519
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Repeating is a special skill.

520
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Please.

521
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,340
Please.

522
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Please.

523
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,340
Please.

524
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,340
Do you want to repeat?

525
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I did everything I could.

526
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
If this is not enough.

527
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
I will do it.

528
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,340
That's good.

529
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
That's a good idea.

530
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
What?

531
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,340
I had a change of wife and child.

532
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
I'm sorry.

533
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Please fix it.

534
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Please fix it.

535
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,340
I closed it.

536
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
What?

537
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
You.

538
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
I.

539
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Repeating is sold at the end of life.

540
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,340
The life of the life is revived.

541
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,340
There is a way to fix it.

542
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
But.

543
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,340
What do you do with the name?

544
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,120
The reason for the

545
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,340
disfigurement is because the last one was out of order.

546
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,340
I asked Makoto again.

547
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,340
I didn't like the appearance.

548
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,340
I wanted to get rid of it.

549
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
That's all.

550
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Such a disfigurement is not a matter of my business.

551
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,340
I decided to have a grand appearance.

552
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,340
I just want to make Sega a lucky stone again.

553
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,340
You are a man.

554
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Then I asked you to do it.

555
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Ananoi.

556
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Thank you for everything.

557
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I think I said it before.

558
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,340
You're not the only one who wants to do something about Yoshiwara.

559
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,340
So I'm not going to call you.

560
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
But.

561
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,340
I left it to you.

562
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Tsutano Juzo.

563
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Leave it to me.

564
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
Bye.

565
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,340
I'm going to the library.

566
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm going to the library.

567
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,340
I'm going to the library.

568
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:42,340
At this time, the book store had a habit of exchanging books for self-publishing.

569
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,340
This is beautiful.

570
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Is it Ogawa City?

571
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Thanks to the old and the new, it has become a good place.

572
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,340
If it is a good place, it will be better.

573
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Many people want to see the new book.

574
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,340
It's a good place.

575
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,340
I can feel the enthusiasm of the new book.

576
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
I'm going to the library.

577
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,340
By the way, isn't that man coming?

578
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,340
He may have run away with his tail.

579
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,340
Is it a good thing?

580
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,340
I want to hear the rumors.

581
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,340
It's late.

582
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,340
I'm going to prepare the food.

583
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I was looking forward to it.

584
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
It's a good thing.

585
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Thank you.

586
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Here you are.

587
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Please.

588
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,340
It's thin.

589
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,340
I made it thin so that I could carry it.

590
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,340
It is a tool that can be used while walking.

591
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,340
What is this?

592
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
It's thin.

593
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
It's a good thing.

594
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
I wonder.

595
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
What is this?

596
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,340
It's like this when you put everything in.

597
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,340
Is this all?

598
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,340
I put everything in until I got a good price.

599
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:18,340
I tried to make the woman's face look at each other.

600
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Is SEGAWA that SEGAWA?

601
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:34,340
SEGAWA is said to be an ominous stone and has no name.

602
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,340
The other day, I was told that I would continue to be an idol.

603
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,340
I became the fifth SEGAWA.

604
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,340
It was late.

605
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I fixed it this morning.

606
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,340
It was a hard time, right?

607
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:18,820
Aren't you riding that

608
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,820
I'm ordered.

609
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,820
Please tell me.

610
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
One copy of the reissue.

611
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,820
One copy?

612
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,820
I made it very cheap because it was thin.

613
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:40,820
I want you to sell it at the original price.

614
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,820
The original price?

615
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
Yes.

616
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,820
This reissue was bought by the men who were common in the area.

617
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:54,820
At that time, the 48th or 24th was a big difference.

618
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,820
I'll see you off if you're 48th, but if you're 24th, there's always someone to buy it.

619
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,820
If it's a half-year, there's someone to buy it for the next father.

620
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,820
And this is a well-known stone.

621
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,820
SEGAWA's long-distance ritual reissue.

622
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,820
How is it?

623
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,820
My reissue is not sold twice as much as it is.

624
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,820
It may be sold.

625
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,820
All right.

626
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,820
Give me 100.

627
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
100?

628
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,820
I don't care.

629
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,820
I'm sorry.

630
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,820
I want to sell it.

631
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,820
I want to sell it.

632
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,820
It may be sold twice as much as it is.

633
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,820
What is it?

634
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,820
Please.

635
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,820
Please.

636
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
Are you all right?

637
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,820
All right.

638
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,820
A scale-shaped shop.

639
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,820
Did you bring the scale-shaped shop back to the warehouse?

640
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
I'll take care of SEGAWA.

641
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,820
Take care?

642
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,820
Mr. Kinkin tells me what kind of people he is.

643
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,820
Make the property a store and sell the money.

644
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,820
I didn't talk about the association of the school's children.

645
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,820
I'm sorry.

646
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,820
I'm sorry.

647
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,820
I'm sorry.

648
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,820
I'm sorry.

649
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
I'm sorry.

650
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,820
I'm sorry.

651
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,820
I'm sorry.

652
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,820
I'm sorry.

653
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,820
I'm sorry.

654
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,820
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,820
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,820
I'm sorry.

657
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,820
I'm sorry.

658
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,820
I'm sorry.
