1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I understand.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Then,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
from now on, we will be

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the Jihon Donya of the city.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We will not be involved in

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
any of this with Yoshiwara.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then, excuse me.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Get out!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yoshiwara is not Yoshiwara.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
whether I make a new sword or

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
whatever,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't sell it to my father.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can sell it in Yoshiwara.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then, I can only sell it to the customers who come.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you live like this, what is it?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's right. That's enough.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll talk to you later.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No! No! No!

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But, you can't do it with your father.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Isn't it your job to do it here?

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You bastard!

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can't just

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
sell it to the people who come here.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you going to do?

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I heard that you are going to

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
sell it to the people who come here

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
all year long.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you going to sell it to the people who come here

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
all year long?

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's your name?

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Tsutaji.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, Shin-san.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, Shin-san.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Did you buy the sword yourself?

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I feel sorry

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
for not being able to solve it.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I feel sorry for not being able to solve it.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, if Mabu isn't here,

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Jorou will be in hell.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's Segawa.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Segawa is here!

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Segawa?

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was mistaken.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you for waiting.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you for waiting.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
for being late, Yudanosuke.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry for being late, Yudanosuke.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry for being late, Yudanosuke.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It seems that

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you made it in time.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's time to pray, right?

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's time to pray, right?

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you going to do tonight?

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you going to do tonight?

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you!

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you!

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Am I a friend?

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Am I a friend?

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Am I a friend?

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you.

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
From now on, please be at ease like my own.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oiran.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes?

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is there something on your mind?

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your sister is a little depressed.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry, Rin-san.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I remembered something interesting.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I see.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then, I'll draw something interesting for you.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oni-san, this way.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
To the other side of the table.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sakura.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hanazono.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Who is it?

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ayame.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Toriyama-sama is a good man.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is there anything wrong with that word?

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Actually, Toriyama-sama told me about Miyuke.

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do I have that feeling?

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are they in love?

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think so.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's forbidden to make a magic wand in Yoshiwara's house.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's not a pleasant story.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Tsusumi.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Shin-sama, wait.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll light it up now.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come on.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is this?

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What is this?

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's go in.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Is there anything wrong with that word?

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I heard that you were going to choose a person like her.

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who is your partner?

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's Toriyama Kengyou.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He is a rich person.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How much money do you want to get?

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
1,000 yen.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What about Seigawa?

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
That's what I'm into.

174
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
If you turn it around, you don't care about the business.

175
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,800
You're a man, right?

176
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,000
Hey, Juzaburo.

177
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
You had something to say, right?

178
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh...

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No.

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,300
I'll be back.

181
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Sorry.

182
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,300
What's with him?

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,800
Welcome back.

185
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
Sorry about that.

186
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,400
The studio!

187
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
You don't have to.

188
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,200
I have something to ask you.

189
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Yes?

190
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,300
About Miyuke.

191
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,700
Miyuke?

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Here.

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,500
300 ryo?

194
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,700
I thought you'd be asking for the money.

195
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,400
300...

196
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
But...

197
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,900
Why all of a sudden?

198
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,900
I was looking for a strange guest to earn my fortune.

199
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,400
He said he'd dig his own grave and enjoy the pain.

200
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,900
My grave is full of wounds.

201
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,100
I thought I'd quit my job, but...

202
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,700
300...

203
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm a man without money.

204
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,100
It's a dream come true.

205
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
In other words,

206
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm a man without money.

207
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm just a hindrance to happiness.

208
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,300
I guess I'm just a hindrance.

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,800
That's right.

210
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,300
You still have this?

211
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,600
It's a gift from a man I met for the first time.

212
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,800
Keep it.

213
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Yes.

214
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
A LIGHT Bths

215
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,600
DIRTY

216
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Sit.

217
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
It's blatant.

218
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
What do you mean?

219
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,600
You've got some good weather.

220
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Hey.

222
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I heard you got a new girlfriend.

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
You're so quick-witted.

224
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah.

225
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You're going to turn me down.

226
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
What?

227
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Actually, I got into a fight with Shu's book store.

228
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
And Saiken too.

229
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I had to deal with him alone.

230
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'm worried if you're gone now.

231
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,600
I heard you said you wanted to be happy when you were dumped.

232
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Yeah, I did.

233
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
But I don't think it's that fast.

234
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Besides...

236
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You don't have to fight for your rights.

237
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Toriyama-sama is a wonderful person.

238
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
He's a good man and he's a good man.

239
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
And he's kind.

240
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
You can't see.

241
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It's hard to take care of him.

242
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I can't be a good person.

243
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
And...

244
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,600
He moves as if he can see.

245
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
He can't see his face, but he can't hurt people.

246
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,600
That's twice as much as a man with eyes.

247
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
You...

248
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Are you in love?

249
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Maybe.

250
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Then...

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,600
You're a laughing stock in Edo.

252
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I don't know how good you are.

253
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
They're all scum.

254
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
They're all scum.

255
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
They're all scum who are so pathetic that they even steal from the organization.

256
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
They make money off of it.

257
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
They're like the lunch of the world!

258
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
You're a lunch for me too!

259
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,600
You took 50 ryo for the sake of the debt.

260
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Now you're saying that you're going to get a job to be a guest.

261
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
If you want to be a guest...

262
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
If you want to be the same...

263
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
You'd better be loved by the world!

264
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't go.

265
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm begging you.

266
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Don't go.

267
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
You're so naive.

268
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
You're crying over your sister.

269
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I know.

270
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm letting her go.

271
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
For Yoshihara and you.

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
But...

273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm not going to let you go.

274
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm not going to let you go.

275
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I don't want you to go to her.

276
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
I want to make you happy.

277
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
So...

278
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Don't go.

279
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm begging you.

280
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
How?

282
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
How can you make me happy?

283
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I'll do something about it.

284
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
What do you mean, something about it?

285
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I'll take it.

286
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I'll let you go.

287
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
You're not going to change your mind, are you?

288
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Of course not!

289
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
It took me two weeks to realize how you felt.

290
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I can't do anything about it.

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
I see.

292
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Don't be so reckless.

293
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I think I'm not the type of person to refuse to accept someone's feelings.

295
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
That's true.

296
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
You said you'd accept me.

297
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
You're so stubborn.

299
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
We've already talked about it.

300
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
What are you going to do now?

301
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
You'd better not accept me.

314
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
You're going to be a good son.

315
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,600
If you accept me, you'll be a good son.

316
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,600
If you accept me, you'll be a good son.

317
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I realized that the more famous the person is, the more popular the person is.

318
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,600
If there's a story to tell, my father will be more popular.

319
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,600
But I don't know if there's a story to tell.

320
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I know.

321
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'll say no.

322
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
You're right.

323
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I understand.

324
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Thank you.

325
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I'll leave it to you.

326
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Is that okay?

327
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
That's a man.

328
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm sure it's a man.

329
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
A man?

330
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
No one has ever made one before.

331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,600
So if you're going to make it, that's the only one.

332
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Now?

333
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Anyway, if that's the opponent, it's a fatal blow.

334
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I'll grab the tail and get a good feeling.

335
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I'll wake up.

336
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Masa!

337
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
From that day on, Segawa's surveillance began.

338
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Oh, my!

339
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Kiku!

340
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Thanks to my life, I'm saved by my family.

341
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
The two continued to deceive each other.

342
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm here.

343
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Masa, please look at me.

344
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I need to talk to you for a while.

345
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
You don't look like you're waiting.

346
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
What about you, Inari?

347
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
I told you.

348
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
There's no way I'd leave here.

349
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
It's the best proof that I'm gone.

350
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
But that's not a proof.

351
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I know.

352
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
With the paper from Surgaya ...

353
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
... Toriyama Kemgyo.

354
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,600
I'm sorry. Segawa is having a bad time.

355
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Maybe I was dumped by Segawa.

356
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,600
No way! Why?

357
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Then why are you in a hurry?

358
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I can't hide it from you, Toriyama-sama.

359
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I can't hide it from you, Toriyama-sama.

361
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Actually, I'm worried about Segawa's fever.

362
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Hey.

363
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
This is what I need.

364
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Segawa will be happy to hear that.

365
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Thank you.

366
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Hey.

367
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm wondering what's going on with my friend.

368
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Leave it to me.

369
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I'll ask him if he's okay.

370
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I wonder.

371
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,600
I don't want to be dumped, but I don't have any friends this time.

372
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
No.

373
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,600
He refuses to be dumped because he doesn't want to be dumped.

374
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
He keeps making fun of him.

375
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
If he gets better, he'll be with him.

376
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Can I make Segawa a shabby person?

377
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
That's true.

378
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,600
I have to do it.

379
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Satake Jiro-sama.

380
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Honda Rikibie-sama.

381
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
This is a lot.

382
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Do you know how much it cost to get a job at Segawa?

383
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,600
It's a kimono, a hairpin, and a piece of clothing.

384
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,600
You're a shabby person.

385
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
You have to earn a lot of money.

386
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Kendo, you're not going to be a shabby person.

387
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
That's not true.

388
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,600
If you're going to sleep with Segawa, don't bother.

389
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm going to get a job.

390
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm not going to get caught.

391
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,600
You're going to make Segawa again.

392
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:51,600
You're going to make Segawa a shabby person.

393
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Are you going to threaten me?

394
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I'm sorry, but I don't feel sorry for the fourth generation.

395
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:14,600
That's the stupid woman who crushed the famous stone in Matsubaya.

396
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm counting on you.

397
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I'm going to get a job.

398
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Segawa and the others?

399
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I'm on leave because of the wind.

400
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Wind?

401
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Segawa-sama is a very important person.

402
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm on leave because of the wind.

403
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
I see.

404
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Jyuzo!

405
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Yes.

406
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
I have something to talk to you.

407
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
What?

408
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Come back again later.

409
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I understand.

410
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm sorry, Tsutaya.

411
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
No.

412
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
I can't take you to Tsutaya.

413
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Yes.

414
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I think I'm a little bit too long.

415
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm sorry.

421
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,600
It's like you're watching the sun.

423
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Does it sound different when you feel it?

424
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,600
What are you talking about?

425
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm sorry.

426
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
No matter how much you decorate it, this is Segawa's job.

427
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Except for two days a year, it's almost every day.

428
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I don't know what you're thinking about from now on.

429
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,600
You're going to make this work for Segawa until the end of the year?

430
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,600
The more customers you get, the less lives you lose.

431
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,600
It's not like you're going to go before the end of the year.

432
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Jyuzo.

433
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,600
The only thing you can do now is do nothing.

434
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Thank you very much.

435
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Please come in.

436
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Welcome.

437
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Mr. Tsutage.

438
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Mr. Shin.

439
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm sorry, but Tamagiku Road is looking for you.

440
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
It's called Hisa, but could you cut it for me?

441
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
It's a little bit interesting.

442
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I'll take the Hisa C.

443
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Mr. Shin, is that the one?

444
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,600
At the time of Tamagiku Road, where more female visitors came,

445
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,600
a passage was being built that was necessary when leaving the gate.

446
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Hisa.

447
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
It's beautiful.

448
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Yes.

449
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Hisa, buy something for your mother before it gets dark.

450
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Thank you, Mr. Shin.

451
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Take care.

452
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Oh.

453
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,600
For example, after the last customer has gone to bed,

454
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,600
he will sneak out of the roof and hide for a while in a place that no one can see.

455
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
He will head to the gate at dawn.

456
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
He will head to the gate at dawn.

457
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
If he is in the back of the car, he will be bored.

458
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
It's not good to sleep in the corner.

459
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Hisa.

460
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Yes?

461
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,980
This is a boring

462
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,600
dialysis.

463
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
How about this?

465
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Thank you.

466
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Yes.

467
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Oh.

469
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Hey.

470
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
I found something interesting.

471
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Oh.

472
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
This?

473
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Well, read it.

474
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Okay?

475
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Can you read it?

477
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Did you see her?

478
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
What?

479
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
She's out of her mind.

480
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
What?

481
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
It's okay.

482
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Hisa.

483
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Yes?

484
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
I'm sorry.

485
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Yes.

486
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Hisa.

487
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Don't worry.

488
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,600
They were two people who were faster than the studio.

489
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Stop.

490
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Don't be loud.

491
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
I'm shooting.

492
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
They were two people.

493
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Stop.

494
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
I'm shooting.

495
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Are you going to be a playboy?

496
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:44,600
I just want to be happy.

497
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Oh, happiness.

498
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,600
You can't be happy with this.

499
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,600
How were you going to live?

500
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Where do you live?

501
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,600
What about the other people?

502
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
You can't live well.

503
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,020
You're a

504
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
You're a

505
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
You're a

506
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
You're a

507
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,020
You're a

508
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,020
You're a

509
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Are you happy?

510
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,020
Where is that happiness?

511
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
I'm asking you.

512
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,020
Shin-san?

513
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
I'll come in.

514
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
What are you doing?

515
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
Mr. Chirisu!

516
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
Let me go!

517
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,020
I want to go with Utsusemi!

518
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,020
Utsusemi won't die!

519
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Yoshihara won't kill Joro.

520
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
He'll die?

521
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Yes.

522
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Is that true?

523
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,020
Yes.

524
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Is that true?

525
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
It's true!

526
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
I see.

527
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,020
I see.

528
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,020
It's not like I tried to run away from Utsusemi.

529
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
Right?

530
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
I was the one who invited her.

531
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,020
I couldn't stand her unkindness.

532
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
I was the one.

533
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,020
I was the one who was weak.

534
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I was the one who was weak.

535
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Mom.

536
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:14,020
Is it a problem for Joro that Yodai Mese is the one who caused trouble?

537
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,020
If she hadn't died like that,

538
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,020
I'm sure many Joros would have been killed by Segawa.

539
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,020
She decided to go out of the gate with a noble look.

540
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:37,020
She was so proud of herself that she crushed her own life.

541
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,020
She crushed her own life.

542
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,020
Joros lost their way to become Segawa.

543
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Matsubaya lost Segawa's gold.

544
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,020
So you wanted to bring Segawa back to life.

545
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,020
I was happy when I said I wanted to make it a lucky day.

546
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
Now everyone can be saved.

547
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:21,020
I thought I finally got a vessel to carry Segawa.

548
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,020
This is a miserable place.

549
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,020
But it's not like I can't change my life.

550
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:44,020
I think Segawa has the job to show her back to Joro.

551
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:56,020
I think that's what it means to carry Segawa.

552
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
I can't do anything about it.

553
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,020
I couldn't stand my own misery.

554
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:20,020
I was the one who was weak.

555
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:33,020
The End

556
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
Juzo.

557
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,020
This book is so stupid.

558
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Joros and Mabu are all fools.

559
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,020
They can't just take their hands off and get away.

560
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,020
No one can be happy with this.

561
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,020
I'm sorry for making you go on.

562
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
What are you talking about?

563
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
It's ridiculous.

564
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,020
I'm saying it was interesting.

565
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:36,020
Juzo made me go on with this stupid story.

566
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,020
I'll never forget it.

567
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I'll never forget it.

568
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
It's a memory that I'll never forget.

569
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,020
I'll be going now.

570
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,020
Juzo's Memory

571
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,020
Segawa's entry has been officially decided.

572
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:41,020
Thank you for this trip.

573
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,020
I look forward to working with you for a long time.

574
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
The Minoshiro-kin is 1,400 miles away.

575
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
The old man is the one who leaves.

576
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,020
And there's another one.

577
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,020
He has to leave the place he used to live in the old man.

578
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,020
Brother!

579
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Princess!

580
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Brother, what kind of seed is this?

581
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,020
I got this from my father.

582
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Will you open your eyes if I give you a seed?

583
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
I see.

584
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,020
If I give you a seed...

585
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
I'll give you a seed.

586
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,020
I want to be the place where Yoshihara Edokko admires.

587
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
I want to be the place where the world turns upside down.

588
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
Can you do that?

589
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,020
Of course I can!

590
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,020
I only have one hand.

591
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Please command Hanuma.

592
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,020
I'm the one who's going to be crushed.

593
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Goodbye.
