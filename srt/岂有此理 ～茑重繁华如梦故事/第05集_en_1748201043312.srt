1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
What will you choose?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,840
Did you write the conversation?

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,360
I'd prefer to write it with the people out there,

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,980
and everyone who would want to know.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,780
Ok...

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,960
Whatever you say in case of it.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
The Ministry of Justice.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,500
This is a studio.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,500
This is the only room that's long.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,800
The juicer seems to have been removed from this story.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,800
In the first place,

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,300
it's obvious that you can't do it without your friends.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,100
Thank you.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,300
In this era,

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,800
each of the employees is gathered and made.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,500
There is a system called the KABUNAKAMA.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,000
The KABUNAKAMA is a system that can't be removed.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,800
You're going to see that?

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,500
Don't you like it?

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm not a fan of Don Chiki.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,900
You're so mean.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
You can't make a book without a script.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,400
You can't just use it in the middle of the book.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,200
But it's not a bad idea.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,500
I'll have to put the one I want in the team.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,500
It's not like that in the world.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,900
It's not fun.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,400
Didn't you say you were going to tell me to go home except for Yoshihara?

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,300
That's right.

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,800
Juicer,

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
I'll do this again next time.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,300
I'll be a good friend with Wakamugasaki.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Sir,

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,200
I'll do it.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,700
Okay.

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,000
aiming for the

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
Pretty

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,700
The end

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
Who are you?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Born and amongst the

43
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,300
которая

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Yo!

46
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,900
It's been a while.

47
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
What's wrong?

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,900
I don't remember anything.

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Well...

50
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Let's tell them.

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,900
What did you do that day?

52
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Don't do anything.

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
You're not going to see me.

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
I'm home.

55
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
You're home.

56
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Thank you for your hard work.

57
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,900
No problem.

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
I'm home.

60
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
No.

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm home.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Leave it there.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
I'll go get it.

64
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Okay.

65
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm going to be a good man.

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I want to live a better life.

69
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm home.

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900

129
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900

I'm home.

148
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm home.

149
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
I haven't done it for 10 years.

150
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,900
But I can't do it.

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
I can't do it.

152
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
So it's not a good way to do it.

153
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Did you say you were Liquorhead?

154
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
To make him Uncle?

155
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
You do want to see me saying that!

156
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
You can't leave your death!

157
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,900
No edginess away.

158
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Would the best time be like this?

159
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,900
To love you here?

160
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Anyone?

161
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
One more!

162
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Here,

163
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

164
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
You're the commander of the Shiba line, aren't you?

166
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,900
You're a good man, but you're not good at it.

167
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at it.

168
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at it.

169
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
You're a scoundrel!

170
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
You're a scoundrel!

171
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
You're a scoundrel!

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,900
If you stop here, you'll be a customer.

173
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
I'm not saying that!

174
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm not saying that!

175
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
I can't take 6.2.

176
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
I want more money, but I don't want it.

177
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,900
I'm not saying that!

178
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
I'm not saying that!

179
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
I'm not saying that!

180
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Shut up!

181
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
I'm not saying that!

182
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
I'm not saying that!

183
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Don't talk!

184
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
You're a scoundrel who's been doing this for 5 years.

185
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Are you talking about the shit?

186
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Shit!

187
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Money is shit.

188
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Do you know where you're going to get your money?

189
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
I got it!

190
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,900
I'm going to go back to Edo and get my money back.

191
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Don't you dare to get your money back!

192
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
I'm going to get my money back.

193
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
You're not getting your money back!

194
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
You're going to get your money back!

195
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,900
You're the one who got it and I'm going to get my money back.

196
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm going back to Edo and get my money back.

197
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Mr. To-san?

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm going to get my money back!

199
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
What?

200
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Get your money back after we get our money back!

201
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Hey!

202
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
If you run away,

203
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
I'll let you go!

204
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Excuse me.

205
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Oh, you're not going to let me go.

206
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
I'm your husband.

207
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
I'm not going to let you go.

208
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
You're not going to let me go?

209
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
You're not going to let me go?

210
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Yes.

211
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,900
I'll sell the things I made in Yoshioara

212
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,900
to the market as a book of the Urokogataya.

213
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
I can't be a good man.

214
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
I can't do that for each other.

215
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Oh, you're not going to let me go?

216
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I'll sell them more and more.

217
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,900
But I'll sell them more and more

218
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,900
to the Urokogataya.

219
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
What's that?

220
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
Is it about the good things?

221
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
The good things?

222
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,900
If you sell them,

223
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
you can't just sell them.

224
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Well,

225
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,900
I'm the only one who's in love with you.

226
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
I'm the one who's in love with you.

227
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Hey,

228
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
I'm not saying that's bad.

229
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,900
But I can't agree with you.

230
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Really?

231
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Yes.

232
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey.

233
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Oh,

234
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Oh,

235
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Welcome.

236
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
The store is in the back.

237
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
The promise is different.

238
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Oh,

239
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Welcome.

240
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
It's your first time in Yoshioara.

241
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh,

242
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Man,

243
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Karamaru,

244
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
you're in.

245
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm good, Tadzu.

246
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
I have a good idea.

247
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
I'll give you a good one.

248
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Isn't it a good thing to talk to Mr. Jirobei?

249
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Please come here,

250
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
Mr. Tadzu.

251
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Oh,

252
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Yes.

253
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Please.

254
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Welcome.

255
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Yes.

256
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Did you make the money?

257
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
No,

258
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
I didn't.

259
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
I was just hanging around.

260
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Mr. Gennai.

261
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Mr. Gennai.

262
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
What's wrong?

263
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Mr. Gennai.

264
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Please help me.

265
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Mr. Gennai.

266
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Is he Mr. Gennai Hiragawa?

267
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Yes.

268
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
What happened?

269
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Please explain.

270
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Let's go.

271
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Let's go.

272
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Karamaru,

273
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
I'll order a meal.

274
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Yes.

275
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Soba.

276
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Let's go to the soba.

277
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Sure.

278
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
This way.

279
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Hey.

280
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
I think I can go now.

281
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Let's go.

282
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Let's go.

283
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Mr. Gennai Hiragawa.

284
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Mr. Gennai Hiragawa

285
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
has such a job as a mountain.

286
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
I see.

287
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,900
He's been doing mountain work

288
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
and is asking him to pay the money.

289
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
By the way, how much is the money?

290
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I think it's about 1000 ryo.

291
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
What? 1000 ryo?

292
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,900
How can you pay 1000 ryo?

293
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
You can't pay it back.

294
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
I don't have any money.

295
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
I can't pay it back.

296
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
I can't pay it back.

297
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I can't pay it back.

298
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
I can't pay it back.

299
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Then you have to pay it back.

300
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
That's the way to meet people.

301
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
I see.

302
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
I came to ask you to help me.

303
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
I don't have any money.

304
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,900
I want to change the iron into a charcoal.

305
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
A charcoal?

306
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Yes.

307
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,900
When you use iron, you use charcoal a lot.

308
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
So the charcoal is already in the fire.

309
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
And the charcoal is also being grilled.

310
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
But I don't want to use iron.

311
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
I want to make charcoal and go back to the old story.

312
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
I see.

313
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
The charcoal will be sold.

314
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Yes.

315
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
I want a charcoal to be sold.

316
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
A charcoal?

317
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Yes.

318
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,900
I put it in my hand and went to my friend.

319
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,900
You put it in your hand and went to your friend?

320
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Yes.

321
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,900
But didn't you sell charcoal?

322
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,900
I just used charcoal for the fire.

323
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
I see.

324
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
I can't believe you sold charcoal like a mountain.

325
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,900
You said you didn't sell charcoal.

326
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,900
So there's no one who wants to sell charcoal.

327
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Is there anyone who talks about it in Yoshibaru?

328
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Let's ask the parents.

329
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
I see.

330
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Please.

331
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Welcome home.

332
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Yes.

333
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Mr. Jirobe?

334
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Yes.

335
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,900
I didn't want to come to the house.

336
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
I see.

337
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
You're a good man.

338
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
I see.

339
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
The house is here.

340
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,900
The parents are running away.

341
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,900
The red one is not drinking.

342
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,900
The red one is not drinking.

343
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
It's not drinking.

344
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
What's wrong?

345
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Nothing.

346
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm getting brighter.

347
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I see.

348
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
I'll tell you when I'm done.

349
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Thank you for taking the time to talk about this trip.

350
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,900
No, I was just thinking about the shop.

351
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Thank you.

352
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,900
The shop is used as a dog.

353
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
I see.

354
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
I'm glad you're doing that.

355
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,900
I'll give you 300 yen.

356
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
300?

357
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
That's a little too much.

358
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
What?

359
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
If you don't sell it for 300 yen, I won't sell it.

360
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,900
You're holding a debt.

361
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
How much?

362
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
50 yen.

363
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
You're not laughing.

364
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
It's a debt.

365
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,900
It's a debt that has been history since ancient times.

366
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
How much is it?

367
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I won't lose my debt.

368
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Are you doing business?

369
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
How much is it?

370
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Go ahead.

371
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
Karamaru.

372
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Yes.

373
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,900
You bought a high-end juicer.

374
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
You're breathing lightly.

375
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
I don't think I bought it.

376
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Mr. Jirozuya,

377
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,900
did you forget to buy something?

378
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Welcome.

379
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Welcome.

380
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Yes.

381
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,900
You're so generous.

382
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm begging you.

383
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
You can't do that.

384
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
You know it, right?

385
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
You're holding a key.

386
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
How about next door?

387
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
I hope you can be a good servant.

388
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
You have to be a good servant.

389
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,900
You'll be a fortune teller.

390
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
You'll be a fortune teller.

391
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Tell me.

392
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,900
I'll tell you what you did that day.

393
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Then, you'll be a fortune teller.

394
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
You'll be a fortune teller

395
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,900
who's been waiting for you.

396
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,900
You'll be a fortune teller.

397
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
You're a fortune teller.

398
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
It's not good.

399
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
You're so long-winded.

400
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
No, no.

401
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
But you always do this.

402
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
You think about the future,

403
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
gather people and make money.

404
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
It's not easy.

405
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
It's not like that.

406
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I don't have a house or a job to take care of.

407
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
If you don't give me a lot of money,

408
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
it'll start.

409
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,900
But you'll be a good servant.

410
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
You'll be a good servant.

411
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I can do that.

412
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,900
But I'm not a good servant.

413
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I used to be a fortune teller.

414
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
You're so good.

415
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,900
You're a good fortune teller.

416
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,900
But I'm a good fortune teller.

417
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
You're a good servant.

418
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,900
You're so good.

419
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,900
But it's not like you can live freely.

420
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Live freely?

421
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,900
There are many ways to live.

422
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,900
You can live freely.

423
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
But you can't live freely.

424
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,900
You can live freely.

425
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Live freely.

426
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Live freely.

427
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
You can live freely.

428
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,900
There are many ways to live.

429
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Mr. Kennai.

430
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,900
I'm going to buy a pumpkin tonight.

431
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
A pumpkin?

432
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
You're going to buy it?

433
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Yes.

434
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Can you tell me who can talk about that?

435
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Mr. Kennai.

436
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Here?

437
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Yes.

438
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Welcome.

439
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
You want to buy a pumpkin tonight?

440
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Yes.

441
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
If there's someone you want to talk about.

442
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Can you read the book?

443
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
No.

444
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,900
I want a pumpkin in Japan.

445
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Welcome.

446
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Japan is not good for pumpkin friends.

447
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
What?

448
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
I know.

449
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,900
But Tsuruya said that he's a good friend.

450
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
I know.

451
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
He's a good friend.

452
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,900
He's a friend of Mr. Kennai.

453
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
That's what he means.

454
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,900
So you're going to buy a pumpkin and go to his house?

455
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,900
That's what I'm used to.

456
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
You're a good friend.

457
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm not sure.

458
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
I'm going to be a good friend.

459
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
You can go home.

460
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,900
But you can't get me a job.

461
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
How about it?

462
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm going to buy a pumpkin tonight.

463
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
A pumpkin?

464
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
I'm going to buy a pumpkin.

465
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,900
It's a shop that I opened in Norue.

466
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm going to Yurie.

467
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Yes.

468
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
500 yen?

469
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Yes.

470
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,900
It's a shop that opens until the next day.

471
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,900
It's a long-distance shopping mall.

472
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Can you sell the items you want to sell?

473
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
I'll sell them.

474
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,900
I'll sell them.

475
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I'll sell the items.

476
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Thank you.

477
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,900
God, God, God, God.

478
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Don't be so sad.

479
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,900
This is what I'm going to say.

480
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,900
By hunting in ANZOKO while traveling,

481
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
a stone is to be sold.

482
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,900
If you collect what you might sell,

483
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,900
a garden will be Glass on the tree for sure.

484
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
When you get a pickaxe,

485
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
better words will flutter.

486
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Weakness and accordion have their field but not greed.

487
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,900
I wonder if he's the right person to be.

488
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,900
I always want to open up a country.

489
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,900
Open up a country?

490
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,400
That's right. We have a lot of stories to talk about.

491
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
When I open up a country with a lot of people,

492
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I want to be able to interact with the foreign countries.

493
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
I want to be able to interact with people.

494
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,900
If I interact with them, I can clearly understand a lot of things.

495
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
A lot of things?

496
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,900
For example, the house of things.

497
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900
If you ask a person to buy you rice and rice,

498
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
you can ask the right person to do it yourself.

499
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
You can't sell a single budo.

500
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,900
The person who will help you with the business is King Gindo.

501
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,900
No, it's the same as the house of people.

502
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
I don't care if the ancestors are great or not.

503
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
I'll tell you what I heard.

504
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,900
I can talk to people who will help me.

505
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,900
I can understand a lot of things.

506
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,900
But on the other hand, I will talk to the people who are great.

507
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,900
If you ask a person to do business with you,

508
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,900
I can tell you a lot of things.

509
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
For example, the smell of the cannon.

510
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,900
The smell of the cannon is good, the ears are good.

511
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
I remember the word.

512
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
You're a common man.

513
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,900
The people eat the meat of the cow's pig.

514
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,900
If you can make a restaurant that can do that, you're very popular.

515
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Well, let's come up with other things.

516
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
The one who makes the boat, the one who opens the axis of the one-way street.

517
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
The one who takes the road from top to bottom,

518
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,900
and makes the one who has a place to sleep.

519
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,900
The world changes from the bottom when the country opens.

520
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Even if we try to do it, it will change the world.

521
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Goodbye.

522
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,900
If you open the country, you will see the rabbit.

523
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Everything will be returned.

524
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
But...

525
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,900
That's not good.

526
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,900
If you open the country,

527
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
you will be destroyed.

528
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
In this country,

529
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,900
there is no one who remembers the war.

530
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Finally, the owner has returned.

531
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Rufu.

532
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Can I go home?

533
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I'm so busy, I'm going to eat something.

534
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Please.

535
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm home.

536
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Yes, Mr. Rufu.

537
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Yes.

538
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Did you buy a high-end book?

539
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
No.

540
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
What do you think?

541
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I feel like the money in the box is decreasing.

542
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
I think you bought something.

543
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I think I bought something.

544
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I wonder what it is.

545
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Hey, Karamaru.

546
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
What?

547
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,900
I decided to take the story of the new story of Uroko Gata and Kakaya.

548
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
What?

549
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
Why?

550
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,900
There is no way to get along with the story of the story of the Erei本夜.

551
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,900
So, I decided to take the story of the new story of the Uroko family

552
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,900
and get along with them.

553
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,900
I think it's the best way to get along with them.

554
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Well, I don't have the chance to live like you.

555
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,900
I can't talk about the story of the story of the Erei.

556
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
I think that's good.

557
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Oh, you promised to be the first Eri of the Tohda clan.

558
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
What?

559
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,900
You promised to be the first one.

560
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,900
I'm actually thinking about it.

561
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,900
First, I'll give you the story of the Erei from the story of Uroko Gata.

562
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,900
I'll write the story of the Erei of Harunobu, who is not the first one.

563
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,900
I'll write the story of the Erei of the same Erei.

564
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,900
I'll write the story of the Erei of Shigemasa, who is the first one.

565
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,900
If you say that, who will be the first one to be the first one?

566
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Then, I'll give you the story of the Erei of Harunobu, who is the first one.

567
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
I'll turn the world upside down.

568
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,900
I'll turn the world upside down.

569
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:46,900
And you'll be the first one to be the first one to be the first one.

570
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
What's that?

571
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
I don't have the chance to go to that place.

572
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
That's good.

573
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,900
I'll tell you a fun story.

574
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
I see.

575
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
That's good.

576
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Then?

577
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Are you hiding something?

578
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
If you have something to worry about, tell me.

579
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,900
I'll be the one to die so I don't feel bad.

580
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Why?

581
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,900
You're my only love.

582
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
I'm not.

583
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
I'm not worried.

584
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Then why are you looking at me like that?

585
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,900
I'm just saying something strange.

586
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
I see.

587
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Shall we go to sleep?

588
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Yes.

589
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,900
I'm going to sleep.

590
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Go to sleep.

591
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
Go to sleep.

592
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I'm not going to sleep.

593
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
What?

594
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
What's going on?

595
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
I'm so sleepy.

596
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Yes.

597
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
What's going on?

598
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
You can sleep here.

599
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Please.

600
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Karamaru.

601
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Karamaru!

602
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Karamaru!

603
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
What's going on?

604
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
Karamaru!

605
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
You're so annoying.

606
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Where's the key?

607
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Uera, we can't go back to that shop.

608
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,900
So don't bother going back to that shop.

609
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Well, where are you going to be taken away?

610
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,900
I think I have time to say it.

611
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
I can't remember.

612
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
What's going on?

613
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,900
I've been looking for a place like Shimamaya for a long time.

614
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,900
A child's house?

615
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Yes.

616
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
I haven't seen it.

617
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Thank you.

618
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
A ballroom!

619
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
What are you thinking about?

620
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Let's go.

621
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,900
Excuse me, I didn't mean to go back to that shop.

622
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm going to Shimagara in the future.

623
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I won't tell you.

624
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
I see.

625
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Excuse me.

626
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Excuse me.

627
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
What happened?

628
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
A child's house.

629
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
A child's house?

630
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,900
A child's house?

631
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
A man with a scar on his face.

632
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,900
He said it was a child's house.

633
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,900
This is the one in his chest.

634
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,900
This is this one?

635
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I was told that this is the one.

636
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,900
I was told that this is the one.

637
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
I was told that this is the one.

638
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,900
I was told that this is the one.

639
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
I was told that this is the one.

640
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,900
I'm not going to tell you.

641
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Mr. Hachio,

642
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Yoshihara has a role as a tiger.

643
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,900
If you have any doubts,

644
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,900
I'll tell you about it.

645
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,900
How about you leave it to me?

646
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,900
If you do something cute,

647
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
I'll know what it is.

648
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Of course.

649
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm sorry.

650
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
You said you were with a child

651
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
who fell into the river

652
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
after being bitten by an unwell wound.

653
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
What?

654
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Well,

655
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,900
I don't think you should

656
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
investigate this.

657
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,900
If you don't know

658
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
what Karamaru was doing,

659
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
you'll be in trouble.

660
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
That's all.

661
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
But,

662
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,900
you can't eat human's mouth.

663
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Karamaru is

664
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,900
so stubborn.

665
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
A box?

666
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
He said he's gone.

667
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
He's gone.

668
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,900
He's a villain.

669
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
He's my friend.

670
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
He's suspicious.

671
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Really?

672
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
What's that?

673
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
This is

674
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
what Karamaru wrote.

675
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
What?

676
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
What do you mean?

677
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
He was a good boy.

678
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,900
But,

679
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
I don't know

680
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,900
who he is.

681
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,900
When I was a man,

682
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I was standing in a boat

683
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
all the way.

684
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,900
I was aware of it.

685
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,900
I was lying because I didn't remember anything.

686
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,900
I was hiding something.

687
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
But,

688
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,900
I was a bad boy.

689
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,900
I was wearing a mask.

690
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
And,

691
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,900
I didn't realize its price.

692
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
為什麼

693
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
It can't be.

694
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
I didn't do this.

695
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
You didn't do this?

696
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I didn't do this.

697
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,900
Maybe he's a child of this world.

698
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,900
I think Karamaru went back to the Oemoto.

700
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,900
What?

701
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
If you don't know about Makoto, you can think of something fun.

702
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,900
That's the spirit of them.

703
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I see.

704
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Karamaru was the eldest son of Oudana, but he was kicked out of the house with a knife.

705
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,900
But he was told to go back home after that knife was gone.

706
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Welcome.

707
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,900
And he didn't look back.

708
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,900
He was just drawing.

709
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Thank you very much.

710
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Karamaru isn't like that.

711
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
What?

712
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,900
He's a good guy.

713
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
He's not like you.

714
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
You said that because you wanted him to.

715
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
He's a good guy.

716
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,900
But he's not like that.

717
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Someday, he'll go back to the Oemoto.

718
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,900
He'll tell me to take him to the studio.

719
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
And...

720
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,900
I'll call him a mysterious knight.

721
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
A mysterious knight?

722
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Yes.

723
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,900
I'll start with a picture that looks like a spring.

724
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
I'll call him a spring now.

725
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,900
I see.

726
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
That's good.

727
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,900
I'll call him a spring now.

728
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Please, let me keep my promise to him.

729
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,900
I'm counting on you.

730
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,900
I'm counting on you.

731
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
I'm counting on you.

732
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
I'm counting on you.

733
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
If you go to the lake,

734
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,900
you'll never be able to see the mountains and the mountains.

735
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Think about it.

736
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,900
The lake will be destroyed.

737
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
The river will be destroyed.

738
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
The lake will be destroyed.

739
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,900
And the other things will be destroyed.

740
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
What will you do?

741
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,900
The waves of the lake are so strong.

742
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
What?

743
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Hey!

744
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Hey!

745
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,900
So, you'll be my new master?

746
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,900
Yes.

747
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,900
Of course, I'll be your new master.

748
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
I'll be your new master.

749
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Anyway, I hope you can make something that will come to Yoshihara.

750
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,900
I'm sure you'll be a great master.

751
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
Let's do our best.

752
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Yes.

753
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Thank you.

754
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,900
The studio has started to move forward again.

755
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
That time.

756
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,900
The studio has started to move forward again.

757
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,900
A man has been holding a full phone for the first time.

758
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
Good morning.

759
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
It's boring, isn't it?

760
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
It's boring.

761
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
It's boring.

762
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
I didn't expect you to say that.

763
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,900
It's a fake crime.

764
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,900
It's a fake crime.

765
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,900
A fake crime?

766
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,900
That woman is so stupid.

767
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
How about making a bad guy?

768
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
I'll be destroyed.

769
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,900
Let's think about the story of the flying fish.

770
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
Yes!
