1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
Athletic

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,680
Professional

3
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,580
Moan

4
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,720
Confming

5
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:02,820
Much

6
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,140
More

7
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:11,700
When

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,700
I can't sing and stand up.

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,700
But my parents can't move.

10
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,700
If I have a hand to sing, I'll have to do this.

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,700
Yoshihara's recent experience was called Yoshihara's guidebook.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,700
It was published twice a year.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,700
Studio?

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,700
As expected, it's a man.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Well...

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
Who's a man?

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Studio.

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
It's a man.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
It smells good.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Yes.

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,700
Oh, I'll go to the flower shop.

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Welcome.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Welcome.

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
I can't sing and stand up.

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
You know that.

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
But Studio.

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,700
What do you do when you call a guest with your own opinion?

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
Do you mean there are many?

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,700
There are many, but I'm trying to make Yoshihara come.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,700
What I'm riding here is Yoshihara's chair.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,700
I'll pull it.

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
Joro.

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Joro's name.

34
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Well, it's like that.

35
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,700
At the beginning, I was like, Jyo.

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,700
I'm using this well and making Yoshihara come.

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,700
You're making it, right?

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,700
But I'm making it.

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,700
I'm in a relationship with Uroko's husband.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Hey.

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Oh.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Oh, I'm here.

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm stuck.

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,700
You're all pretty men.

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,700
I'm not good at making flowers.

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,700
You're right.

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,700
I'm not good at making flowers.

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm stuck.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,700
I'm going to have a meeting with people today.

50
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,700
But if you show me your smile, I'll think the same as ever.

51
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
What should I do?

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
I'll have a smile.

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,700
That's the man in Hasegawa's show.

54
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Well, Hasegawa is a good person.

55
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,700
I'll tell you how to fall without a doubt.

56
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
I'll ask for the rest.

57
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I've included the ink.

58
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Hey.

59
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
You don't think it's strange anymore, do you?

60
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Of course not.

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm already very angry.

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
See you.

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,700
I'll tell you how to fall without a doubt.

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Hey, you too, do something.

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Hey.

66
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I can't hear you.

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Don't do anything bad.

68
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,160
you

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've been busy.

70
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,700
That might have made me feel better.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,100
Hmm?

72
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
What?

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
The Eyes of the E captain had a fortune.

74
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
He was an elegant man who walked never to see.

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
He's a good guy.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm sure the most familiar to him is

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,700
a guy who can show you how to roll a paper.

78
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
A guy who can show you how to roll a paper.

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Hey, wait.

80
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,200
Foil.

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Now, everyone,

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
take it.

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,700
It's paper!

84
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,200
It's paper!

85
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,200
This paper flower.

86
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
If you put it in now, it's a chip.

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,200
It's about 20,000 yen each.

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
It's paper!

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Here we go!

90
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,200
It's paper!

91
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
It's paper!

92
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
It's paper!

93
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
It's paper!

94
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
It's paper!

95
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
It's paper!

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
It's paper!

97
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
It's paper!

98
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
It's paper!

99
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
It's paper!

100
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
It's paper!

101
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
It's paper!

102
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
It's paper!

103
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
It's paper!

104
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
It's paper!

105
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,700
It's paper!

106
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
It's paper!

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
It's paper!

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
It's paper!

109
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
It's paper!

110
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
It's paper!

111
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
It's paper!

112
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
It's paper!

113
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
It's paper!

114
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
It's paper!

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
It's paper!

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
It's paper!

117
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
It's paper!

118
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
It's paper!

119
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
It's paper!

120
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Episode 24

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
It's a paper flower as long as youWait.

122
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,500
I wonder if you have money to be friends with.

123
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
Hey, Juzo.

124
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,200
Yes?

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
You went to Tanuma's place.

126
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Are you going to read?

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Don't be so formal. I'm just a director.

128
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,800
You know, Tanuma...

129
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
You're a pretty man.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
Did you get married?

131
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,400
I can't. I'm taking you.

132
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,700
Well, I don't know.

133
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
I'll ask you if you have money.

134
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,900
Yeah.

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,900
I can't think of anything bad.

136
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,900
Well, you know...

137
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,400
Oh.

138
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Hey, Oiran.

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
For example,

140
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,900
if you want to sell your stock in a small shop,

141
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
who will you ask to sell it to?

142
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
That's the only one.

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,900
Yeah, that's the one.

144
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
The unhappiness of the rich and the unhappiness of the poor.

145
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
The more you listen to it, the more you don't know the truth.

146
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
The more you listen to it, the more you don't know the truth.

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,900
That's right.

148
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,900
Do you have something?

149
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
No.

150
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,400
I got it from the customer's small stuff.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Thank you.

152
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,400
What did you decide to sell?

153
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,400
The ore ore was sold as a souvenir at the time.

154
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
It was more popular than the Shina's Hitsu.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
It was a product that was popular in the past.

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I put out the money, so I don't know if I'll listen to it or not.

157
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,400
But I thought I'd save one and I bought it.

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
And then, the person who thought of the too much of the shop...

159
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
The Hiragagenai?

160
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes.

161
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,400
The Hiragagenai? The next experience, right?

162
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,400
I want to call the customer to Yoshihara.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Um...

164
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Here.

165
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Here?

166
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I think the Hiraagagenai is a place where you can be mistaken.

167
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
If so, customers will come and the re-sale will be sold more.

168
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
I don't think it's a bad thing to say to the master of the store.

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Well, I'll say it.

170
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Master of the store, thank you, Tomigaras.

171
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
But, if you can get the queen,

172
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I don't have a hand, so you can get the queen from the Hiragagenai.

173
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I...

174
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Yes!

175
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
But?

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
The Hiragagenai is not found.

177
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Where is the queen's book tonight?

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I went.

179
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
The shop where you asked for the book.

180
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
The playroom.

181
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I went to all the shops.

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,400
But everyone is talking, and I'm looking for it, so if you find it, tell me.

183
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
But...

184
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Why are you living there?

185
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
You should tell the shop owner to find it by himself.

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
It's a customer who cares about it.

187
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Well...

188
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,400
How about I ask Mr. Tanuma to ask him?

189
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Ask Mr. Tanuma to get the queen.

190
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
You want to see it?

191
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
You can't see it in your dream?

192
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
You have the hand.

193
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
You have the hand, right?

194
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
What do you mean?

195
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Mr. Izumiya said it before.

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
That Hiragagenai is on a date with Mr. Tanuma.

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Damn it.

198
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm not good at speaking.

199
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Alright.

200
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Hey, Shinosuke. Are you done?

201
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Yes.

202
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Damn it.

203
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You're looking at me.

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Don't you remember me?

205
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I heard that you're a bad guy.

206
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Oh, Yoshimaru.

207
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
What's wrong?

208
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Don't you know Hiragagenai?

209
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I know that.

210
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm a real artist, a writer, a writer.

211
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm a great writer.

212
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm a great writer.

213
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I heard that you're on a date with Mr. Tanuma.

214
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Don't you know where Hiragagenai is?

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
What do you mean by that?

216
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm looking for Mr. Gennai.

217
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm looking for Yoshihara Saikin.

218
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
He's a guest now.

219
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I can't call him because he's looking for him.

220
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I see.

221
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Sayonara Saikin.

222
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
No problem.

223
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
I'll call Mr. Gennai.

224
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
What?

225
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm not sure if I know Mr. Gennai.

226
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm not sure if I know Mr. Gennai.

227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm not sure if I know him.

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
That's a bad name.

229
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I see.

230
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400
But I don't think I can call him just like that.

231
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Yoshihara.

232
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
You're not going to say anything, Shinosuke.

233
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
What?

234
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
What's wrong with you?

235
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Mr. Gennai.

236
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Well,

237
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I am?

238
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
No, I'm not.

239
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
You're a good guy.

240
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm not rich.

241
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
You're a man with no money.

242
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Can I ask you something?

243
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Of course.

244
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
I'm working in the mountains.

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm coming to Gagoshima.

246
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm working in the mountains.

247
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
He's a fool. He's a fool.

248
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
He's a fool.

249
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
You can't be a fool.

250
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
If you don't dig the gold, silver and iron,

251
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
this country will be destroyed.

252
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
You said you'd close the country.

253
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
You don't know what to do.

254
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You can't get the gold and silver.

255
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
You're a piece of shit.

256
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Now you're going to pay back the silver.

257
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
What?

258
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Pay back the silver?

259
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
How stupid are you?

260
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,400
You're going to pay back the silver and go to me?

261
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
But why do you have so much silver?

262
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
That's what I'm talking about.

263
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
This is it.

264
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,400
The silver that came out after the fire.

265
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Mr. Tanuma gave it to me.

266
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I don't have any iron or silver that came out of the silver.

267
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
That's enough.

268
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,400
I want to use this to get rid of the money.

269
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
This world is full of money.

270
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
What can we do?

271
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
We can make money.

272
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
We can't do anything.

273
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
We can't make money.

274
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
We can't make money.

275
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Then we'll be put in there.

276
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
We'll be beaten up.

277
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Then we'll be in trouble.

278
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
How much do we have to do?

279
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
We'll make new money.

280
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
We'll have to get rid of the money.

281
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
But we have a lot of money.

282
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,400
We have to pay back the silver and silver.

283
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Where is it?

284
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,400
For that, we have to pay back the silver and silver.

285
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,400
We have to get rid of the silver and silver.

286
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,400
For that, we have to pay back the silver.

287
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:36,400
So, you've understood the importance of the disaster.

288
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I see.

289
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I don't understand.

290
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
If you can't understand,

291
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,400
you can't just buy rice and ask the witness to do it.

292
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Mr. Shogun,

293
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,400
the witnesses who are now in power

294
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,400
are saying that they're not good.

295
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Then, you'll have to pay back the silver and silver.

296
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
You're right.

297
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
If you open your mouth,

298
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
you'll see that the witness is not good.

299
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
That's the idea of the criminal, the criminal, the criminal.

300
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
You'll see.

301
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes.

302
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
The criminal is not good.

303
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Shizuko is more quiet than I thought.

304
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,400
She's just a little old.

305
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
The reason is that she's the most famous in the underground.

306
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Yoshigara is far away and has money.

307
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
She's noisy and noisy.

308
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Here it is.

309
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I thought you couldn't do it.

310
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Don't you think you're being fooled?

311
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
What?

312
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I heard that you're going to Yoshibara now

313
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
because you're with your uncle and uncle.

314
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Where are you going?

315
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Mr. Shogun, I'm going to Matsubaya.

316
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
I heard that Matsubaya is good.

317
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
I don't know.

318
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm enjoying the inside better.

319
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I heard that.

320
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I heard that.

321
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Then,

322
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
this is the end.

323
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Thank you.

324
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Then, I'll have tea today.

325
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Hey, do it with a glass.

326
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes.

327
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Is there no Segawa?

328
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Gozane.

329
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I don't have Segawa now.

330
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
You mean you're not here now?

331
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Sega...

332
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Sega is an old-fashioned temple.

333
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
No one is here now.

334
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
The price is rising.

335
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I see.

336
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
There's no Segawa here.

337
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Then, no one is here.

338
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Please be careful.

339
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm not going to be high, Mr. Gozane.

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Mr. Gozane.

341
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Mr. Gozane.

342
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Well...

343
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
When can I meet Mr. Gennai?

344
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I don't know.

345
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,400
But he can't write for me.

346
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
He can write a letter to Yoshibara.

347
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
I don't know where to sign.

348
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I'm not enjoying it.

349
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I'm enjoying it.

350
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
But I don't know.

351
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Where is the good place of Yoshibara compared to Okaboka?

352
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm a beautiful woman.

353
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I don't know.

354
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
The police are here.

355
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Everyone can talk about the police.

356
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Look, the big one is so beautiful.

357
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
It's so beautiful.

358
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Anyway, I'm sure I'll find a woman.

359
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Why?

360
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
I'll find a woman.

361
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Really?

362
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Yes.

363
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm sure I'll find a good woman.

364
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Then, come here.

365
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I'll be a good woman.

366
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Then, I'll meet Mr. Gennai.

367
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
What about Okonomiyama?

368
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I think so.

369
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I think it's a good place for a woman.

370
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I'm done.

371
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
I'll wait for you at the bridge.

372
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Then, I'll meet a woman.

373
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
I won't say goodbye.

374
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Sorry.

375
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I was surprised.

376
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
No.

377
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I'll be a good woman.

378
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
When I meet a woman,

379
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll cry.

380
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
I'll meet a woman.

381
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
I'll meet a woman?

382
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I'll meet a woman.

383
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I'll meet a woman.

384
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I'll meet a woman.

385
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
What's the problem?

386
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
They're going to kill me.

387
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
They're going to kill you?

388
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
They're going to kill me?

389
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
They're going to kill you.

390
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
I'll go there.

391
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm talking to my father.

392
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Then, I'll go to the bridge.

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
What?

394
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
No, that's all.

395
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Damn it.

396
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
What did you do to them?

397
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
What?

398
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
They're going to kill me.

399
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
You're so stupid.

400
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
You're so stupid.

401
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
You're a fool.

402
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
But,

403
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I smelled something.

404
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I talked to Mr. Tanuma.

405
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I was shocked.

406
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
What are you doing?

407
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
You're not running around for this house.

408
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
You're so stupid.

409
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Mr. Gennai.

410
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm so sorry.

411
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Gennai.

414
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,400
You're a fool.

415
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm so hard on you.

418
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I want to see you.

419
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I wanted to make you feel good.

420
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,400
I found a good girl for him.

421
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I'll call you.

422
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
I saw Yoshimaru's good side.

423
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I think it's better for me to talk to him.

424
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
What are you talking about?

425
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm a man.

426
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
I forgot that.

427
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I see.

428
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Gennai is a famous restaurant.

429
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I've written about Yoshimaru's good side.

430
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
What?

431
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,400
But I can't tell you how I feel.

432
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,400
I thought it was different today.

434
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
But,

435
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I saw a samurai.

436
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm sorry.

437
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
I'll make him a good guy.

440
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Yoshimaru.

441
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I'll look at him.

442
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I'll write it.

443
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,400
I'm a man.

444
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm a fool.

445
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
I think it's better for me to talk to him.

446
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
No, no.

447
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
You...

448
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,400
You're a good man.

449
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
That's good.

450
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
That's good.

451
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
You should wear the Oiran's dress.

452
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Then I'll wear it.

453
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Oiran's dress?

454
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
You're so nice.

455
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Are you serious?

456
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Then,

457
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
let's do it.

458
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Don't be so rude.

459
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
You're a fool.

460
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
You asked me to kill you,

461
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,400
but I'm not.

462
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,400
I thought you were a man.

463
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Are you a man?

464
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Or are you a man?

465
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Tonight,

466
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll be on the Se-gawa.

467
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Se-gawa?

468
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
While I was in the army,

469
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
you said you would do the Se-gawa.

470
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I wonder if there is no Segawa here either.

471
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,400
And the heart of the two of them,

472
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
the one who is now a friend of Hiragasa's,

473
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
is the second one.

474
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Is it because Segawa is a Kikunojo-sama, that you are a gozarin?

475
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Hiragasa wanted to live with someone called Segawa,

476
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,400
who is just like Koyoi.

477
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,400
For example, it could be someone else.

478
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Segawa is not in the current Matsuba.

479
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
But if you are willing to go there,

480
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,400
please call Segawa.

481
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
There is no place to hide,

482
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
and no place to hide.

483
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Kill the first king, Yuumiya.

484
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Kill the Segawa of Matsuba.

485
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I wonder where he is.

486
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
What?

487
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Well then...

488
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Hey, you.

489
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Please look forward to it.

491
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
What were you doing here, Juza?

493
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
I was tired, so I'm going to sleep.

494
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm tired too.

495
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Good night.

496
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Good night.

497
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
What's wrong?

498
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,400
He was saved.

499
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,400
What a pity.

500
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Did he get you?

501
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Is it possible that Juza gets someone?

502
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,400
No one can get him.

503
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,400
He is a man like that.

504
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,400
You don't notice it, do you?

505
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Then you don't notice it.

506
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Segawa.

507
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
I have a request.

508
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Can you wait for me?

509
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Hello.

510
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,400
How are you?

511
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm fine.

512
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I wanted to get close to you.

513
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I was talking to you.

514
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Are you tired?

515
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Yes, I'm tired.

516
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I'm tired.

517
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I see.

518
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
You have a different desire to have a man.

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
What?

520
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
A different desire?

521
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Yes.

522
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Can you give me a match?

523
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Then I'll give you a discount.

524
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
You don't have to.

525
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,400
I used to get married at times.

526
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I like to see that.

527
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,400
I see that.

528
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Then...

529
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:28,400
When you get back home, did you write this for him?

530
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,400
Then this woman finally got to me.

531
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,240
And then suddenly people hit me a lot with their attacks.

532
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,360
And I forgot to return it.

533
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,220
It's wonderful.

534
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm not the行人.

535
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,820
My風吧です。

536
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,220
Good bye.

537
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,740
Tell me S haven't you?

538
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm sorry.

539
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Thank you.

540
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
You saved me.

541
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Asaga-onee-san...

542
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,400
...is not the only one who's sad.

543
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,400
You're the only one who thinks that you have to do something about Yoshihara.

544
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I know that you can do it with a cage, but...

545
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,400
...you're not alone.

546
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Then...

547
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
...you're not alone.

548
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Next.

549
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
There are two ways to see women.

550
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,400
When you talk to one or two people, you'll see three people die.

551
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,400
And the skin will become skin.

552
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Yoshihara will choose women for a whole year.

553
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,400
No, she won't have a chance to live.

554
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
There are no flowers in the greenery of the yana.

555
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,400
There are two ways to see women.

556
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,400
There are no quiet things, and no lively things.

557
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Women who are all together...

558
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
...are gone.

559
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
And there are no more.

560
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
They're all gone.

561
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
They're all gone.

562
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
But...

563
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
...when the sky is clear...

564
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,400
...this is the good person of everyone, you know.

565
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
The world is...

566
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
...well, it's wide.

567
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
It's half-way, half-way.

568
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Oh, it's a trap.

569
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
The world is...

570
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
...well, it's a trap.

571
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
The world is...

572
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
...well, it's a trap.

573
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Half-way, half-way.

574
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Oh, it's a trap.

575
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
But I think you wrote it well.

576
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Thank you.

577
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I'll use it.

578
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Here.

579
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh.

580
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,400
There's a coin on the top of the top.

581
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,400
I thought you could give me a few.

582
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
You bought it yourself.

583
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Yeah.

584
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I see.

585
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Well,

586
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,400
...would you like me to re-read the recent one?

587
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Re-read it?

588
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
For example...

589
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
...this is the place.

590
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
The place where the broken store is black,

591
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
...and it's too early to go to sleep.

592
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,400
And the lost old lady's name is on the corner.

593
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You can't just re-read it.

594
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
If you want to do it,

595
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
...it's fine.

596
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Me?

597
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Yeah.

598
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
If you want to do it,

599
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
...it's fine.

600
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
I'll do it.

601
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,400
I'll do it.

602
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Well,

603
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
...we'll have the first person to go to the magazine.

604
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Yeah, but...

605
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
...what's the matter?

606
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Good morning.

607
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
I'll go to the Kawaya Okari.

608
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Oh, Shin-san!

609
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Where are you?

610
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
At the studio.

611
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
At the studio?

612
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Yes.

613
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Good morning.

614
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Good morning.

615
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Good morning.

616
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Good morning.

617
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
The studio was being filled with

618
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,400
...the work of the staff.

619
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
And then,

620
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,400
...a single mother was born.

621
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
The one and only child of Ue-sama,

622
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
...Harusada Kyon,

623
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
...is Toyo-chio-sama.

624
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
This is the seat of the celebration.

625
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
The one who was born was Ue-sama's cousin,

626
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
...the leader of the Tayasuke,

627
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
...Haruaki Kyon,

628
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
...and the brother of Masamaru.

629
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Ue-sama's brother,

630
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
...Shimizuke Shigeyoshi Kyon.

631
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,400
The five new members who have come here

632
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
...were called Go-san Kyon,

633
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
...and the one who was born was

634
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
...Orii Tsugisuke,

635
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,400
...who was the eldest son of the Shogun family.

636
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
By the way,

637
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
...the one and only child of the Tou family.

638
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Hate,

639
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
...there is no other mother.

640
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Mr. Hitotsubashi,

641
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
...Mr. Tanuma!

642
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Today,

643
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
...you all were invited to my celebration.

644
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Mr. Hitotsubashi, you are a doll.

645
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
You came to the house of the Chikagoro,

646
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,400
...and you brought me to the house of Tanuma.

647
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,400
I am very happy to have you here.

648
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I am very happy to have you here.

649
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
I am very happy.

650
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
How was it?

651
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Before my birthday,

652
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,400
...you were really very nice.

653
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Yes,

654
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
...I was just talking about the real Tayuka.

655
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
I see.

656
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Then,

657
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
...you will become a Kairai-shi.

658
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Mr. Hajio!

659
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
If you want to become a Kairai-shi,

660
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
...you will have to draw the blood of the Yoshimune-ko.

661
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Mr. Hitotsubashi,

662
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,400
...how can you be so proud of the blood of the Onmi?

663
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,400
You are so hot.

664
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,400
You are a school-class martial arts master.

665
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Do you think that you should be proud of us

666
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,400
...before you are a martial arts master?

667
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
What?

668
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
You are not like this.

669
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Mr. Hitotsubashi,

670
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
...how can I be proud of you?

671
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Thank you.

672
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Please forgive me for saying such a weak word.

673
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,400
You said that you should be proud of us.

674
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,400
You are not proud of us.

675
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Sayo, Sayo,

676
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
...as long as we are not angry,

677
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,400
...we will not be angry.

678
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,400
I can't believe that you are not like this.

679
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Sayo,

680
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,400
...but you should be proud of Mr. Masamaru.

681
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Mr. Masamaru,

682
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
...if you are a singer,

683
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
...would you be able to enjoy the song?

684
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I have been impressed.

685
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I should be proud of the heart of the martial arts master.

686
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I am sorry.

687
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Please forgive me.

688
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,400
I am sorry that I can't follow the flow of time.

689
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,400
I am sorry that I can't follow the flow of time.

690
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
No,

691
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
...I am sorry that I can't follow the flow of time.

692
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
I am very impressed.

693
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
It's done.

694
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
It's done.

695
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Please continue.

696
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Yes.

697
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
You are a good man.

698
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Sayo, sayo, sayo.

699
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I am sorry.

700
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,400
You came all of a sudden last year.

701
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
You are a Kangerasu from Arigatayama.

702
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
You are a horror movie.

703
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
You want to kill us, Taisu.

704
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Shut up.

705
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Shut up.

706
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
If you don't do something,

707
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
...you won't get back to Yoshihara.
