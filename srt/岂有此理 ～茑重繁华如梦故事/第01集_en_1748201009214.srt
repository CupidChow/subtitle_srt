00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Run! Run! Hurry! Run!

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000

Hey! What are you doing?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Run! Run!

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Run! Run!

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hurry!

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can't follow you!

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No! Please!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't want to die!

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No! Don't!

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No!

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What are you doing?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to the foreign country!

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't!

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you doing?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't take them away!

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to burn them!

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're a god!

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hurry!

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Come on! Let's go!

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay!

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll have to see you.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Run!

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There he is!

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hurry!

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Run!

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hurry!

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Where are you going?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go!

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Run!

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Run!

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Run!

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Run!

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Run!

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Run!

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What are you thinking?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What about your father and mother?

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go!

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The name is Kunen.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The name is Kunen.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This great and unruly body of a demon

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is a sign of the existence of a demon.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The reason why the fire broke out in Meguro's temple

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is the origin of the fire.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The fire was set in the wind from the south

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and burned the city of Yoshihara and Edo on the third day.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The time when this disaster occurred was...

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The Emperor's Resurrection!

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
10th grade, Tokugawa Ieharu.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Emperor's Resurrection

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was about 170 years since the birth of Edo.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's not the day of war that

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Edo was born into.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to be an era of peace,

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to raise a flag,

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want to be a great demon.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Emperor!

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Emperor of the Three Gorges!

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sun of the Great Thunder of Osh whipped me.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Many terrible groups crossed the underworld

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to fight the axe

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and wanted to make theirThese times

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
able to walk through

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There was a man who ran through the forest.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He had no money, parents, or houses.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are you doing? We have to go!

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The one who was the best in the forest,

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
told him to listen to the flowers and read the wind.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The wind has changed.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go!

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Finally, he became the king of the Edo Medias.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Jyuu, everyone is going that way.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hurry up! Don't go this way!

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go!

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
His name is Tsutazyu.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tsutaya Jyuzaburo.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
His name is Matano.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
His name is Karamaru Tsuta.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000

He is the king of the Edo Medias.

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He is the king of the Edo Medias.

He is the king of the Edo Medias.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well,

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it's been a year and a half since that time.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I came back to Yoshihara.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What?

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What is Yoshihara?

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, I will guide you

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
to the place where

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will guide you.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yoshihara is a town where men play with women.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The only place where

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the Edo Medias is located is

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
the town where the Edo Medias is located.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It is the only town in the Edo Medias.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It is the town where the Edo Medias is located.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The town is

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
located in the middle of Asakusa.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It is the town of Uka-Bushima.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It is the town of Uka-Bushima.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It is the north side of the town.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's why it is called the north.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
For example,

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the time from the Japanese bridge is

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
about 1 hour.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's not that far away,

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
but the place is remote and the cost is high.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There are many places to go.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's like going to Chitok.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
At that time,

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
there were about 10,000 people

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
living in the town of Yoshihara.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It was a normal town.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It looks like a town,

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but Yoshihara is strict with the Joro's head.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was surrounded by a forest called the high-rise,

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the Ohaguro-Dobu.

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is the Dobu where I fell.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's why the entrance to Yoshihara

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
is basically just one of the Omen.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
From the middle to the Omen,

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the way to the town is Yoshihara's experiment.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And at this moment,

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
we were the main characters,

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the tea shop in the studio.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The tea shop in the Omen

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yoshihara's guide

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
is the tea shop in the Omen.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We taught the guests how to store and store things,

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and the Joro's information.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
At that time, the studio was a tea shop

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in the Omen.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We worked in this tea shop.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Brother,

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
there are still no Shimada and Nishio-sama,

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
so please come.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If Shimada and Asaya are the children,

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Nishio-sama will be the black one.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Please.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hey,

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
why doesn't Jirobe-san work?

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Brother, you can't be that kind of person.

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Then, Tita-san will be the black one.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Tita-jun will be the black one?

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I wonder.

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Brother is the black one,

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
but this is the white one, the white one.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The white one, the white one?

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, I see.

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If the old man is an unborn child,

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
he will be the black one,

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and if the old man is an adult,

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
he will be the black one.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There are many men in Yoshihara.

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brother, hello.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's go.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Good morning.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Good morning.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hello, Masubara Noe-sama.

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nice to meet you.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Good morning.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, you're doing well.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, princess,

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
the staff of the singer's room is here.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Good morning, Masubara.

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Good morning.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Good morning.

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Today, we have a new book by the three of us,

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the book of the Tatsumi,

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and the book of the Ishiyama military.

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you have a number of Hirakana?

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, thank you.

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
At this time, Tita-jun was working in a cafe

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
in the office of the chair.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The cafe's synod is

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the red book for children,

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the blue book for adults,

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the book of the Jou-ru,

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and the book of the Rokumon,

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
which is about 24 books.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The book is about 72 books.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
By the way, there are 16 books in total.

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, it's a kind of small-scale earning.

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If you have a good conversation,

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you can write it down in this library.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's easy to read.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Isn't it?

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Tata-jun.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's wrong?

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This...

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm back from Ayame-chan.

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What should I do?

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey, hey, man.

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll put on the red book of the three of us,

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
which Ayame made a mistake.

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The 18 books are too complicated.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I made the book of the six of us,

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the book of the Ishiyama military,

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
a mistake.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Isn't it enough?

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's not a new book that you made a mistake.

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's a book of the five of us.

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Damn it.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you still a kid?

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you still a kid?

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You're a total of 26 books in total.

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What's this?

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
After this,

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you'll be a student, right?

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Send this to Asaga-onee-san.

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Then, will you pay me if you send it?

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
18 books.

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Send it to Asaga-onee-san.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You and Asaga-onee-san.

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you saying that?

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you saying that?

260
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Damn it.

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Haramuru,

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
bring the tea.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well,

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
the young master who asked the studio to use

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
the tea to make it,

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is about the whole ohake of the palanquin.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Here, at the influx of Yoshibara,

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
the《Jyuwa受styling》 deshalb chievers

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,200
are now the popular

270
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:12,000
and-)

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
At the moment by now,

272
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yoshibara has become a wide- lớn,

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
very popular and-" boredom of Yoshibara".

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello, princess.

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sure you're right.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You want me to play with you?

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I just came back from playing with you.

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No way.

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're a kid.

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can't stand it anymore.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Kanji!

282
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What are you doing?

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't like you.

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No, no, no.

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Come here!

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're so mean.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Morning, sis.

288
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Come in.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Are you okay?

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was too close.

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I didn't know you were so mean.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is a flower.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I was a little bit late.

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's so bad.

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't even afford to pay for it.

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't put it in.

299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

300
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're eating it, right?

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll eat it later.

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hurry up and give it to me.

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can't take it.

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're so mean when you eat it.

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You've never seen a man before.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I see.

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, let's do it.

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
A big hand comes to a hand.

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
A small hand comes to a hand.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is also a good thing for a young man.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When he sees a dragon,

312
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
he attacks him with a smile.

313
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
At that time, he can't stop smiling.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm going to take a walk around the village.

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Come in.

316
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Good morning.

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're so mean.

318
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're a singer.

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I didn't even take a bath.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm a singer.

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't have a guest for three days.

322
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm going to have a lunch.

323
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This is it.

324
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm going to the Okabashio and Shukuba.

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Where is the cart?

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okabashio and Shukuba are the non-disabled.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They were Yoshihara's rivals.

328
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They're going to change the girl.

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yoshihara is a good girl.

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
She took the girl to the washroom.

331
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yoshihara's men are going to the washroom.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
She's still early.

333
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Kanjo, take her back.

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, sir.

335
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Take her back, Karamaru.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't laugh.

337
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You don't have to be a good girl.

338
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're a good girl.

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But he said that.

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But he said that.

341
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But he still doesn't remember anything.

342
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He said that.

343
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I saw it.

344
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I want to hear it.

345
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What's wrong with you?

346
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can't do it.

347
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, my lord.

349
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Are you Yoshihara?

351
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

352
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sorry.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You look so hot.

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Welcome.

355
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you.

356
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Thank you.

357
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's go to the washroom.

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What?

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Did you steal the older brother's sword?

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

361
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yoshihara has decided to go to the washroom.

362
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
She'll go to the washroom when she gets to the shop.

363
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You've never been told that.

364
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you're in trouble,

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
you'll be punished.

368
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Here.

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is a good one.

370
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Brother.

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll go to the washroom.

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That man is the one who's been caught by the old man.

373
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The old man is the one who's been caught by the old man.

374
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The old man and the old man are...

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Hey!

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Who are you trying to get?

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That old man!

378
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yes.

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You can go that way.

380
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You should have a good look at people.

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes.

382
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Brother.

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Are you okay?

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm fine.

385
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm fine.

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm fine.

387
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm fine.

388
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can't get used to the bad smell of flowers.

389
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Flowers?

390
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It stinks and it's not good.

391
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll see you later.

393
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Thank you.

394
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He left because not knowing you at midnight.

395
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sleepy.

396
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Hold on.

397
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:29,020
Self

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What is it?

399
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What do you want to be?

400
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What kind of dance is this?

401
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What kind of dance do you want?

402
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Please play with me, brother.

403
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000

Good boy.

407
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Hey, I came in from Izumiya.

Usually, a downstream."

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000

Me.

415
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,280
2nd class

416
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,740
It's picked-up coin jednak.

417
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,060
Many pulled it into Yamaha's behind,

418
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,520

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560

Oh, cute flowers!

421
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm sorry.

422
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm waiting for you.

423
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm waiting for you.

424
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm sorry for the wait.

425
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Mr. Izumiya.

426
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
The least weight of the people.

427
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,280
There are also 100 people inside.

428
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
There are no people or people inside.

429
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I laughed.

430
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
I didn't mean to.

431
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Women are the same.

432
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Where are you going next?

433
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280

Thank you.

443
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,280
What do you mean you can't do that?

444
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm a big brother.

445
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,280
I said I want to do it with that woman.

446
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
What are you doing?

447
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,280
That samurai came to tell me to let him do the flower.

448
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Today, there are some guests.

449
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,280
You're going to be a bad guy.

450
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
You can't do that.

451
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
The day after

452
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
The day after

453
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280

455
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
The day after

456
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
The day after

457
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Who are you talking to?

458
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
This man.

459
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
He's the boss.

460
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
He's the boss.

461
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
What are you talking about?

462
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
And

463
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,280
he's the boss for the repeat.

464
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Look.

465
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,280
The new servir She comes up from the!

466
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280

467
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,280
The first, she comes up from the!

468
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
The big one

469
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,280
He came up b-dothero

470
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,280
That's what you're talking about.

471
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,280
This trip, I was able to become a leader of the Hasegawa family.

472
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
I'm a Zuka Tagen!

473
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Good evening!

474
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I can't believe I'm a good-for-nothing.

475
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
I'll give you a break.

476
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
A drink?

477
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Yes.

478
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,280
I'm a childhood friend of the Hasegawa family.

479
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
A friend?

480
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
How about this?

481
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Could you please let me have a little bit of your performance?

482
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,280
The one and only, Yoshihara Ichi.

483
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Yoshihara Ichi?

484
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Yoshihara Ichi, who is a good-for-nothing.

485
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,280
He's a great-for-nothing.

486
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Good evening!

487
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Good evening!

488
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280

00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Good evening!

491
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Good evening!

492
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Good evening!

493
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Good evening!

494
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
A good-for-nothing?

495
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Yes, he's a good-for-nothing.

496
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,280
But he's been playing with me for a long time.

497
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I heard that the Hasegawa family is playing with their parents.

498
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Is that true?

499
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
They were sure that they were going to be a good-for-nothing.

500
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,280
They were sure that they were going to be a good-for-nothing.

501
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,280
They were sure that they were going to be a good-for-nothing.

502
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
That's great!

503
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,280
I'm the best-for-nothing.

504
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
Hasegawa-sama!

505
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm honored to have you here today.

506
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm sure that you'll be the best-for-nothing.

507
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,280
I'll be the best-for-nothing.

508
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,280
I'll be the best-for-nothing.

509
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
I'll be the best-for-nothing.

510
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,280
A bad doing

511
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
You said you were Robertson.

512
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Sorry I'm late!

513
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,280
My mum was so weak when we wanted to borrow after were so my customers said...

514
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,160
Must have devastated a visitor.

515
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,860
I guess it's up to you to actually bring yourểm evolved back up.

516
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,900
I'll take care of it!

517
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,460
• Please forgive me!

518
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,320
Don't wheeze!

519
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,100
You wanted to make it taste awful?

520
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,920
Yeah, why not?!

521
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,580
• I'll make you all hell!

522
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,880
You look dazed at yourself.

523
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,960
Don't you dare take me away from such cows.

524
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,100
I won't sleep anymore.

525
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,220
• I won't stay here again!

526
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,860
• I won't stay here again!

527
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,780
Please forgive me!

528
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,700
• Please forgive me!

529
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,360
Sorry!

530
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,800
Enemy base.

531
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Thank you.

532
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
You ate it properly.

533
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I ate it.

534
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,280
I ate it because I ate it.

535
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
I ate it.

536
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
I ate it.

537
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Nisa.

538
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Can you take it off?

539
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
I'll take it off and sell it.

540
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
This is the real deal.

541
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,280
You saved me.

542
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
One day,

543
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,280
I was abandoned by a two-man.

544
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Hey.

545
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
You were abandoned.

546
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
You work at home.

547
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,280
And my father, Surugaya,

548
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,280
was bullied by my father.

549
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
He was bullied by my father.

550
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
At that time,

551
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,280
my sister Asagawa was next to me.

552
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
I'm sorry.

553
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,280
They're going to get sick.

554
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I'll take it off.

555
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Please, I'm sorry.

556
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Do you know what this is?

558
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
It's a picture of a baby.

559
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
I'm sorry.

560
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
My father and mother

561
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
might have gone to the police.

562
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
My parents

563
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
were bullied by my father.

564
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
They were afraid of the news.

565
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
They didn't know what to do.

566
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
That's right.

567
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
If they don't know,

568
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,280
they'll think about a fun reason.

569
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
That's more fun.

570
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Karamaru is

571
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,280
a hidden job of Lord Kubo.

572
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
My father and mother

573
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
are real shopkeepers.

574
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
They're good people.

575
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
They're kind people.

576
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
They're kind.

577
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
They're hard to catch.

578
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
They eat and eat.

579
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,280
And they end up like this.

580
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,280
I'm not a woman who likes Yoshihara.

581
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
She's a woman who's been cursed.

582
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,280
She's a tough girl, but she eats only a little.

583
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Even if she doesn't have a brother, she eats only white rice.

584
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
That's what Yoshihara is.

585
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm sorry.

586
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm sorry.

587
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I didn't mean to eat it.

588
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I'm sorry for talking like this.

589
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
What's this?

590
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Well,

591
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Momoka's doing it.

592
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I'm sorry.

595
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
I'm sorry.

596
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm sorry.

597
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm sorry.

598
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
I'm sorry.

599
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,280
It's only for this case.

601
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
And who demonstrate here?

602
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
You can go through here!

603
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,280
I'm surprised.

604
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Our new rich woman is who's pretty.

605
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,280
What's going on?

606
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
They're the ones who have the pumpkin.

607
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
When you add the pumpkin, it's fine.

608
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Here it is. One of the pumpkin.

609
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Daimonja was the one who made the pumpkin.

610
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Yes, yes.

611
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
The one who made the pumpkin, the pumpkin!

612
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm going to...

613
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,280
...dice the pumpkin.

614
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
What are you doing?

615
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Keiren, you're not going anywhere.

616
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I said Keiren!

617
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
The father of the village.

618
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,280
I know that you left in the morning.

619
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
The reason is because you can't eat.

620
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
I heard it's a chest.

621
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
The villagers are destroying the body.

622
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,280
They're going to kill the mountain and the wild boars.

623
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,280
You can't eat properly.

624
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
In the meantime,

625
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,280
can you get me some snacks from the father?

626
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,280
If you keep doing this, the land will be reduced.

627
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,280
The customers will be reduced and the stores will be destroyed.

628
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,280
You don't want the father, do you?

629
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Shut up!

630
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
You can't die without a reason.

631
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,280
The shopkeeper's job is to call out to the women.

632
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,280
There are many women everywhere, but they're just opening 100 shops at once.

633
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,280
You should be able to enjoy the customers more.

634
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
The weight is the same every time.

635
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
You're right.

636
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,280
You're not ashamed of that.

637
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
The father is not a human being.

638
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
He's a human being.

639
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
We're not human beings.

640
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
We're just a boar.

641
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,280
A boar is not a human being.

642
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,280
A horse's day is not a horse's day.

643
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
A horse's day?

644
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
But...

645
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,280
But we're being forced to be a boar, aren't we?

646
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Yoshihara!

647
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,280
A boar is a boar, and a boar is a rabbit!

648
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I was taught a lesson.

649
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,280
You can't be a boar in this place.

650
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
You're lying!

651
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
Father!

652
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Damn it!

653
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
It's so stinky!

654
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Well...

655
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
I'm afraid we'll lose our way.

656
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
You're right.

657
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,280
We can't afford to sell the shopkeeper's clothes.

658
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
We can sell them at the market.

659
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
If we keep doing that, we'll lose our way.

660
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
We can't sell the shopkeeper's clothes.

661
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,280
You're saying that we'll be able to sell the shopkeeper's clothes?

662
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
That's right.

663
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Well, then, go ahead.

664
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,280
The shopkeeper's clothes...

665
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
The shopkeeper's clothes...

666
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Why are you bringing this to me?

667
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
You're a boar.

668
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,280
You're a boar!

669
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
You're a boar!

670
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
You're a boar!

671
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
They're a boar!

672
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
They're a boar, and a boar.

673
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,280
They're a boar, and a boar.

674
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
They're a boar, and a boar.

675
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Let's clear the shopkeeper's clothes.

676
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,280
They're only going to die of work.

677
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
What if they don't?

678
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,280
What if they don't?

679
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
What if they don't?

680
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm a good man, but I'm too lazy to buy a shopkeeper's clothes.

681
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,280
I can't afford to sell the shopkeeper's clothes.

682
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,280
I'm going to see Mr. Tanama.

683
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Mr. Tanama?

684
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,280
He's not a go-round.

685
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
What?

686
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,280
He's going to ask you about the stuff you're waiting for.

687
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,280
He's so tough.

688
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
He's tough.

689
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
I'll do that.

690
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,280
This is actually...

691
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Mr. Tanuma's smug-like dress.

692
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
How is it?

693
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Do you want to use it?

694
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Mr. Tanuma?

695
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Mr. Tanuma?

696
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
It's impossible to do it.

697
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,280
Mr. Tanuma, here you are.

698
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
Mr. Izumiya!

699
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
I'm so sorry.

700
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,280
Can you take a picture of me?

703
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
No, I can't.

704
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
I don't know.

705
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,280
I'll wear it to make it look like I'm wearing a bun.

706
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,280
I'll wear it to make it look like I'm wearing a bun.

707
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
Here.

708
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Let's go.

709
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Yes, thanks.

710
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Up.

711
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Yes.

712
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,920
Izumiya, in the suburb.

713
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Yes.

714
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Then,

715
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,720
wait for me to get that.

716
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
Yes.

717
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,840
This is a job advice.

718
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,240
Are you taking me out this time?

719
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,080
Yes, yea.

720
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,320
Sir, thank you very much.

721
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,320
I don't think it's good for you.

722
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
I don't think so.

723
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
It's okay. You're fast.

724
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
There are so many.

725
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
It's just a father without a mother.

726
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Thank you.

727
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
Wait here.

728
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,320
Thank you.

729
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
What are you doing?

730
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
I haven't seen you in a while.

732
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
How are your back?

733
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I'm sorry for the last time.

734
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,320
I heard you were on the field of new land.

735
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Yes.

736
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Hey.

737
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
Yes.

738
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
I'm sorry.

739
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,320
I have a good house in Kanuchi.

740
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,320
I want to see one of your houses.

741
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Don't bring such things.

742
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
I don't want to.

743
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Please take a look.

744
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
This is a house that I can't live in.

745
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Let's live in the pond.

746
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
The sea of Yamabuki.

747
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
When the birds are born,

748
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
they will be happy.

749
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
I'm sorry.

750
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm sorry.

751
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
I'm sorry.

752
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
I'm sorry.

753
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
I'm sorry.

754
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
I'm sorry.

755
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
I'm sorry.

756
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
I'm sorry.

757
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,320
I'll leave you with a great fortune.

758
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
While you're at it,

759
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,320
you have also a great fortune.

760
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,320
What?

761
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,320
I want to ask Mr. Tanuma

762
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
if he can help me.

763
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
You!

764
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Please be patient.

765
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Thank you.

766
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
You've given me a great fortune

767
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,320
But I can't do it.

768
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,320
If Yoshihara regains his power, I'll be the one to make sure...

769
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,320
I can't let Yoshihara lose her country's power just because of her.

770
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Country's power?

771
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
You...

772
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
Name is?

773
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,320
I'm Juzaburo from Tsutaya.

774
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Juzaburo from Tsutaya?

775
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,320
If we talk about Shikubamachi,

776
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,320
what would happen if we could go to the Shinkansen and go to the Shinkansen?

777
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,320
What would happen if Shikubamachi, the five-way road to Edo,

778
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,320
was crushed by one?

779
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,320
Shikubamachi will be a long way from Shikubamachi.

780
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,320
So we'll have to travel a lot and reduce the chances of being in a bad mood.

781
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,320
If Shikuba is crushed, the chances of being in a bad mood will decrease.

782
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,320
And the huge profits will be reduced.

783
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,320
If we return to the country's power,

784
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,320
if Shikuba is in a bad mood,

785
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,320
and the chances of being in a bad mood will increase,

786
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,320
we'll have to return to the great country's power.

787
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,320
So...

788
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,320
What would you do to prevent Shikuba from being in a bad mood?

789
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
What?

790
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,320
We're going to the Bakuchi with a woman.

791
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Is that so?

792
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:35,320
So, we've recognized the huge increase of the Mechimori woman in Shikubamachi.

793
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,320
And thanks to that, Shikuba will be a big city.

794
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,320
And the culture will be better.

795
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,320
We'll have to take it to the court to save Yoshihara.

796
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Then...

797
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,320
How about we just go to the other place?

798
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Yoshihara received the heaven's forgiveness in the first place.

799
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,320
There were many women who were in danger.

800
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,320
And that's a good idea!

801
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,320
And...

802
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,320
If we're told that it's heaven's forgiveness,

803
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,320
then we'll have to go to the temple of the god.

804
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,660
Remember me?

805
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,100
Your father and I said just before.

806
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,360
Now, if you say that again...

807
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,440
Yes.

808
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,600
Us concubines who even travel with us in the future

809
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,680
come here without any reasons.

810
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,280
I think the unfortunate Muy should join us

811
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,460
and obey her wishes,

812
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,120
not to listen to us for a prisoners' award.

813
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,800
What do you mean!

814
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,900
We need help to cool down the problem,

815
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,240
but we should letraj the nameless

816
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,860
desolate machine

817
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,860
You're not getting used to the place where you sleep.

818
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,860
I'm being strict with you!

819
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,860
Then...

820
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,860
I don't need a man to call me a scum.

821
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,860
What are you doing?

822
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,860
Calling a customer a scum.

823
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,860
I'm going to call you.

824
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,860
Izumi.

825
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,860
Yes?

826
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,860
I've called you.

827
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,860
See you.

828
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,860
Thank you for your help.

829
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,860
Tanuma!

830
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,860
Tanuma!

831
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,860
I've got a feeling that my eyes are going to close.

832
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,860
Makoto!

833
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,860
Thank you for your help!

834
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,860
The End

835
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,860
Wow, that's huge!

836
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,860
What's wrong with Makoto?

837
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,860
He's a scum.

838
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,860
What are you doing?

839
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,860
What's this?

840
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,860
I don't know.

841
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,860
He's here to ask for a scum.

842
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,860
I'm sorry.

843
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,860
I came to the office to ask for a scum.

844
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,860
I heard that he's been quiet.

845
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,860
But I'm wondering if he's looking for a scum.

846
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,860
But I'm going to crush him!

847
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,860
Shut up!

848
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,860
Tanuma, if you want to act,

849
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,860
you have to see the woman in the office.

850
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,860
I can't let you do that.

851
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,860
Then, let's call a customer a scum.

852
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,860
Tanuma, call a customer a scum.

853
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,860
Tanuma?

854
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,860
Tanuma, are you sure?

855
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,860
I'm sure.

856
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,860
You scum!

857
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,860
Mr. Tanuma!

858
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,860
Mr. Tanuma!

859
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,860
Mr. Tanuma!

860
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,860
Stop it!

861
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,860
Stop it!

862
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,860
What are you doing?

863
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,860
Open the door!

864
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,860
Mr. Tanuma, don't do anything!

865
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,860
Open the door!

866
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,860
What are you doing?

867
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,860
Open the door!

868
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,860
Mr. Tanuma!

869
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,860
What's this?

870
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,860
This!

871
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,860
What are you doing for YOSHIYARO?

872
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,860
Open the door!

873
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,860
Mr. Tanuma!

874
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Mr. Tanuma!

875
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,860
Mr. Tanuma!

876
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,860
Are you okay?

877
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,860
Shut up!

878
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,860
Then, a few days later,

879
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,860
the studio was thought of as a small house.

880
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,860
In the morning and in the night.

881
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,860
What are you doing?

882
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,860
Calling a customer a scum.

883
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,860
And then,

884
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,860
the time when the third day was too much.

885
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,860
Mr. Tanuma!

886
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,860
Hey!

887
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,860
What's YOSHIYARO doing today?

888
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,860
I'm going to kill you!

889
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,860
Hey!

890
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,860
This is it.

891
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,860
Mr. Tanuma, are you okay?

892
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,860
Are you okay?

893
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,860
Are you okay?

894
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,860
It's dangerous!

895
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,860
Hey!

896
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,860
YOSHIYARO's re-examination.

897
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,860
Now, the customer is king.

898
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,860
Where is the good thing about YOSHIYARO?

899
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,860
I'm a woman.

900
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,860
You're the only one who thinks YOSHIYARO has to do something.

901
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,860
I'm here.

902
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,860
Open your mouth and make money.

903
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,860
I'll make money for you.

904
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,860
Give me a break.

905
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,860
Give me a break.

906
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,860
The first one.

907
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,860
Are you asking me to go to the hospital?

908
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,860
I'll do it.

909
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
To the doctor.

910
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,860
You're not alone.

911
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,860
All right.

912
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,860
I did it.

913
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,860
Mr. Nishimura.

914
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,860
YOSHIYARO's re-examination.

915
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,860
I'll hit you.

916
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,860
I don't think it's bad.

917
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,860
I'm sorry.

918
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,860
Don't ever give up on the king.

919
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,860
Damn it.

920
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,860
The first one.

921
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,860
If you think it's good,

922
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,860
store the garage with a short amount of tomas.

923
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,860
This waxing iron is the end of the rest swimming.

924
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,860
He said.

925
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,860
It's all for the management.

926
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,860
Bear this.

927
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,860
It's design is one-point.

928
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,860
It's better than with clothes.

929
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,860
