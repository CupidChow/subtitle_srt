17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,440
The relationship is about the prediction of the future.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,440
The men who are good at it at that time

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
I appreciate that.

96
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Yes.

97
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Now, are you aware?

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I will not listen to you in Zen.

99
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Your heart is about to die by this.

100
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Ahem.

101
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Um...

102
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll take this one.

103
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Who's this?

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,940
Tawamure Tanuki-san.

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Oh, it's burning!

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
It's burning!

107
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
It's burning!

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
It's burning! It's burning!

109
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,440
It's burning!

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,940
You're so funny to me.

111
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
It says Mondex, who made it, has more.

112
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,940
He makes it fun with his friends.

113
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Producer.

114
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
How are your eye-c Fuji?

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Um.

116
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,940
I told him not to come...

117
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
Ah.

118
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,940
Did you make a mistake?

119
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,940
I'm not a simple person.

120
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,940
I'm just a friend of mine.

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm not a servant.

122
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
What?

123
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
What? You're so surprised.

124
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,940
I don't have a book to read.

125
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
What?

126
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,940
I read it all the way around here.

127
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
Oh.

128
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
How about Aobon?

129
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
He's a good man.

130
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:33,940
Aobon is a manga that has been known for a long time.

131
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
Aobon is...

132
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
boring, isn't it?

133
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,940
You're boring.

134
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Studio.

135
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,940
Oh?

136
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Are you going to the studio today?

137
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
Yes.

138
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Aobon

139
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Shinosuke.

140
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,940
This is from the book.

141
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
I'm so embarrassed.

142
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Oh, sorry.

143
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Studio.

144
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Yes.

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,940
I heard that you're in pain because of the flower.

146
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,940
You can pay for the flower by yourself.

147
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,940
That means that the money I have to pay for the flower is in the form of a coin.

148
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Well, the coin is in the form of a coin.

149
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
Oh, Shinosuke.

150
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Shinosuke.

151
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
This is it.

152
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Yoshihara Saiken.

153
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,940
I'm going to give this to the book that has more customers.

154
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,940
If you have any ideas, please let me know.

155
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,940
How do you want to give this to me?

156
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
That's...

157
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I don't have anything to think about yet.

158
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
I'm going to give this to you.

159
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
The Kankabouji that has been raised.

160
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,940
What are you talking about?

161
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Saiken is also an interesting thing.

162
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Let's start with the most important thing.

163
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
What is important?

164
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
I don't know.

165
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
It's like a coin.

166
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,940
You can make a lot of money.

167
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,940
You can make a lot of money by yourself.

168
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,940
You're good.

169
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm good.

170
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,940
Father.

171
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
It's time to go out.

172
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I want a big hit.

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Wow.

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,940
Wow.

183
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,940
You're making a lot of money.

184
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
I'm going to become a Shomotsu Donya.

185
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
You're not going to be a Shomotsu Donya.

186
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,940
If you become a Shomotsu Donya, you'll be able to get out of it.

187
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,940
You can sell this book 10 times or 20 times.

188
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,940
You can keep the contents the same.

189
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,940
Father said that you should sell it more often than the book.

190
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Half.

191
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Half.

192
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Yes.

193
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,940
Can you make a Shomotsu Donya?

194
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,940
The one who made it look like a Shomotsu Donya is better.

195
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,940
You work hard.

196
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,940
You can't do this to me.

197
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,940
I'm going to get out of here.

198
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,940
I'm a big hit.

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Is the shop tough?

200
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
It's not a hit.

201
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
It's a mess.

202
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,940
The clothes are burnt.

203
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,940
The clothes are all burnt.

204
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,940
The shop is a mess.

205
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Even if the fire is over, the fire will not stop.

206
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,940
Are you saying that you're a Shomotsu Donya?

207
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,940
Yes.

208
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,940
I want to help my father.

209
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Your husband is working very hard.

210
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
I'm sure he can't do anything.

211
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,940
But I'm asking you to do me a favor.

212
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
I'm asking you to do me a favor.

213
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Yes.

214
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Welcome.

215
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Where did you get this?

216
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
I got it from the shop.

217
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,940
I got it from the shop.

218
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
Hamamoto?

220
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,940
It's a game log.

221
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,940
This is the Kami-Kuzu from Aobon.

222
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,940
This is the Kumenbo from Satori.

223
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Thank you for the welcome.

224
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,940
I got it from the shop.

225
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
This is for you.

226
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
You got it from the shop.

227
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
It's from the shop.

228
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,940
I got it from the shop.

229
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Thank you for the luck.

230
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,940
I'm glad to hear that.

231
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
And the luck.

232
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,940
Can you give me the money?

233
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,940
The money?

234
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,940
The money is from the shop.

235
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm glad to hear that.

236
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,940
I'll be waiting for you.

237
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
I got it.

238
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,940
I want to put it in my ear.

239
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Thank you.

240
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
Have fun.

241
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Thank you.

242
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Thank you.

243
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Please understand.

244
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
It's a silver coin.

245
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,940
It's a silver coin.

246
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
It's a silver coin.

247
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
Do you have anything?

248
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,940
What?

249
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,940
I don't read books.

250
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,940
You can draw.

251
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
You like drawing, don't you?

252
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Then,

253
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,940
do you like the black ink?

254
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm good at drawing.

255
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
You're good at drawing.

256
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,940
When did you stop reading?

257
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,940
I liked Aka-bons when I was little.

258
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Aka-bons have a lot of drawings,

259
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,940
but adults only read G.

260
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
What about A-bons?

261
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,940
A-bons have a lot of drawings, like Aka-bons.

262
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,940
A-bons are boring.

263
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,940
If it's boring, do you read A-bons?

264
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Maybe.

265
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
It's boring.

266
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,940
It's boring.

267
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
It's boring.

268
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,940
This is it.

269
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,940
First Seongsu MetSang

270
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
Good morning, 12th Seongsu MetSang

271
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Good morning.

272
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,940
I need your help?

273
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,620
She was here worried about me rho—

274
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,260
It's okay, healthy brain dead.

275
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
Well then—

276
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,240
this was the sun before Marko.

277
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,680
But I thought he was been sleeping with Conservatemt.

278
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,280
You have your name.

279
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,140
I called ceremonies.

280
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,220
Have you turned it into simple-looking?

281
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,160
We ignored all thateno—

282
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Please don't get mad.

287
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Anyway,

288
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm sorry that I can't talk to you

289
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,160
because I hate you.

290
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,160
I'm sorry that I can't talk to you.

292
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
If you say that

293
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,160
you're a very interesting person,

294
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,160
wouldn't that be a joke?

295
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
You should be sorry.

296
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
If you say that you're a very interesting person,

297
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
wouldn't that be a joke?

298
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,160
If you say that you hate books,

299
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,160
wouldn't that be a joke?

300
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
You're a rabbit.

301
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
This is not a standard book of the hour.

302
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,160
It's a story about how to spread the book.

303
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Well,

304
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
I understand the logic.

305
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Then, what is the interesting script?

306
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I read it again last night.

307
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,160
The script is a bit of a habit.

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
A habit?

309
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Well,

310
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,160
I'm not saying that I'm old-fashioned

311
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
or anything like that.

312
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm talking about the old days.

313
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Can't I talk about

314
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,160
how to enjoy the school?

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I didn't think you'd say that.

316
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
That's good, Mr. Katsuta.

318
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Let's think about the story of how to live a fresh life.

319
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Hey!

320
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Did you have fun with Shikagoro?

321
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Yeah, something like that.

322
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
That's like

323
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
a relationship between the old-fashioned and the young.

324
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Old-fashioned!

325
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Old-fashioned.

326
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
You're so mean.

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
That's not old-fashioned!

328
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
You're so mean.

329
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I saw you wearing a glasses last night.

330
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I think you were told that you were wearing a glasses.

331
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm not going to wear it.

332
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I'm not going to wear it.

333
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
I'm going to be arrested.

334
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
That's nice.

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm going to go.

336
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,160
See you!

337
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
I have nothing to be afraid.

338
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:18,160
b-h nombre of gr transparent

339
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Continued from the movement

340
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,160
where you live

341
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:42,500
Here's the

342
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:51,180
thought.

343
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,660
Against the

344
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,660
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
But the Tokugawa family,

360
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
the Hatamoto family,

361
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
and the Prime Minister were involved in the incident,

362
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
so it was a huge disaster.

363
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,660
In the first place,

364
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
even the Taika family,

365
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
the company had already been taken.

366
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
The company had already been taken.

367
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,660
Don't be angry.

368
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
Don't be angry.

369
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
But the money was finally restored.

370
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
But the money was finally restored.

371
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
And the great disaster was still being restored.

372
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Then,

373
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
what about the important thing

374
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
that you have to tell the emperor?

375
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
Did you

376
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
have a chance to get rid of me?

377
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,660
Did you have a chance to get rid of me?

378
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,660
Yes.

379
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
The Emperor

380
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
I somehow lost the money I had for the Bakufu family.

381
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
The Hatamoto family,

382
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
the Prime Minister,

383
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
the Koryu family,

384
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
and many other people who have a debt on the Prime Minister's debt.

385
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Moreover,

386
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
the Kinsaku family,

387
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
the family that has a debt on the Kinsaku family,

388
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
the family that has a debt on the Kinsaku family,

389
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
the family that has a debt on the Kinsaku family,

390
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,400
the family everybody is an introvert a good as such has a debt

391
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,120
on the Kinsaku family.

392
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
But

393
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
if you go along with the Kinsaku family's debt

394
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
or their debt,

395
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
things might situation

396
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,660
just like that.

397
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Don't forget.

398
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:14,420
Myット is brief, but Jerso's sweetheart is around 200,000 taels.

399
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,320
I guess I was trying to get across from you.

400
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,140
Where are you going?

401
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,080
D updated

402
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,340
I'm inflated with siro friends

403
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,180
Ue-sama's husband

404
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,780
That's to your own cuánt

405
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,420
Do you have any regard for the family?

406
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,860
After their funeral, everyone was suspicious

407
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,800
Are you looking up to Siro friend of Chihuahua?

408
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,620
Excuse me, sir.

409
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,960
Commander of US is your享 flats.

410
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,480
Do you feel satisfied with the reach of Miss UEE's instructor?

411
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,600
She's so quiet.

412
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
But, General,

413
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,400
how long does this score weigh?

414
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:37,400
If you do, I'll ask you to hand over the Tangerine from the company of the famous Hata.

415
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Yes.

416
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
How about making one bad guy?

417
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,400
If there's a bad guy, it'll be interesting to talk about it.

418
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
I know.

419
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,400
And I'll use this gold-grilled one to make a sweet white.

420
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Bad guy?

421
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
It's a bad guy who's a great master.

422
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Master?

423
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Master, good.

424
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Let's go with a bad guy.

425
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Yes.

426
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,400
At that time, he was called Master in the apple of the shop.

427
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
That's good.

428
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
You're so good.

429
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,400
It might be interesting if you put that kind of good in the front.

430
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,400
If you look closely at the door of the tree, you can see that it's his.

431
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Thank you, Tomikaras.

432
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
The scary-error-dressman.

433
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Jiguchi.

434
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Jiguchi is always a good guy.

435
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,400
But it's a good thing to draw and draw.

436
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
There's a guy with a eye on it.

437
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,400
If you draw a picture in the middle of the tree, you can see that it's white.

438
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Wait a minute.

439
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
I like making books.

440
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You're so good.

441
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,400
My old man is a man who made a red book for Edomuke.

442
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Really?

443
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Yes.

444
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,400
At that time, all the books were made in paper.

445
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
But Edomuke and paper were different.

446
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,400
The beginning of the book was to make something fun by reading the books.

447
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
My old man made a blue book.

448
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,400
He said that he could enjoy the children who grew up reading the red books.

449
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,400
So I thought that this was destiny.

450
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,400
When I said that I wanted to make a blue book,

451
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Mr. Tewara.

452
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Oh.

453
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
What's wrong?

454
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I thought that I was the one who made this book.

455
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
The book of the Seityu.

456
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Actually, this is a fake book.

457
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Fake?

458
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Yes.

459
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,400
It's a pirate version of the book.

460
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I thought that I was the one who made this book.

461
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,400
The father said that the book was better than the book of the Seityu.

462
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I can't believe that I'm a pirate.

463
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,400
What if the person who made the book of the Seityu finds the original one?

464
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
You're being a good person.

465
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You're a good person.

466
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm being a good person.

467
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,400
So, the fake story is the original one?

468
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,400
I was hiding something and I didn't know anything.

469
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,400
The fake story is hard to make money.

470
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I might be able to break the old story.

471
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Then,

472
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,400
I heard that my mother bought me a book.

473
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:46,400
But, the fake story is a real bad thing.

474
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,400
I think you can confirm it before you get in trouble.

475
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
But, you can't hear it.

476
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
I'll confirm it.

477
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Thank you, brother.

478
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I didn't do anything.

479
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Hey, you're here.

480
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Are you going to talk to your husband?

481
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Tegoshi, hurry up.

482
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Hurry up.

483
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Wait.

484
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I don't think it's the proper way.

485
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Yes.

486
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Kira-gata Wakano

487
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm so proud of you, Mr. Hiragata Wakana.

488
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,000
I know, I know.

489
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And thanks to Mr. Urokogataya's Tebeki.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
No, no, no.

491
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,200
Here you go.

492
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
So, how is it?

493
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,000
The studio.

494
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah, I've been working on it.

495
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,600
It's been running around for us.

496
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Please keep running.

497
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,400
Yeah.

498
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,200
If Yoshihara has a half-moon of 20,000,

499
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,200
we'll be so full of sweets.

500
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Sit down, Mr. Urokogataya.

501
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Yeah, what's up?

502
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Oh.

503
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Wow, what a nice weather.

504
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,600
Nice weather.

505
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
No, I can't.

506
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm sitting on the chair, but I can't fit in the mouth.

507
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
Is that so?

508
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
That's a good way to put it.

509
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,600
I'm going to the hotel.

510
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Hotel?

511
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm not going to do anything.

512
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,600
I'll let Urokogataya leave the luck to the hotel.

513
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Urokogataya, please.

514
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Take your time.

515
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,600
This is the request for the car repair shop in Tokyo.

516
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I'll do it again.

517
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Naoto-ko's building Jimny at Salt-icuda-sAT

518
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Where married Xiao Geng

519
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600

Ran Flash

Uashima

527
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I was so angry that I couldn't stop crying.

528
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Please, please.

529
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I want you to do something that's not your fault.

530
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

531
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You're a man of your word.

532
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You're a man of your word.

533
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You're a man of your word.

534
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You're a man of your word.

535
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You should be punished for your crimes.

536
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'll give you a lesson.

537
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm not your son.

538
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm your son.

539
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You're a man of your word.

540
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're a man of your word.

541
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Think about it.

542
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm a man of my word.

543
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I can't be a fool.

544
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
If you keep doing this,

545
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll be punished for my crimes.

546
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I want you to do something.

547
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm so happy to see you again.

548
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm glad you came.

549
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I was thinking about the future of my job.

550
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm not sure.

551
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But...

552
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Do you know where the God of the Gods is?

553
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Do you know where the God of the Gods is?

554
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You're a man of your word.

555
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You're a man of your word.

556
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm glad to see you again.

557
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I wish you a good rest.

558
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I wish you a good rest.

559
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I wish you a good rest.

560
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

562
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'll take your leave.

563
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The Buddha's name is Ishi.

564
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The Buddha's name is Zenzhaemon.

565
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The Buddha's name is Masako.

566
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Today, I've put you in a place.

567
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I've put you in a place.

568
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I've put you in a place.

569
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I've put you in a place.

570
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Wash out the dirt and dirt in the dark.

571
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And find the one who can ride a little bit in the middle of the road.

572
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Father, let me tell you something.

573
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
There's a place called Sanoh.

574
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The one that's useful.

575
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's a place where the Buddha's name is written.

576
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's a place where the Buddha's name is written.

577
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's good to have a good rest.

578
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I want you to help me.

579
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Father!

580
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You don't need a good rest.

581
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Thank you.

582
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Did you talk to the person inside?

583
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes.

584
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I told her to start right away.

585
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Thank you for your help.

586
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
This is the Buddha's name.

587
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Thank you.

589
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Please wait.

590
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The Buddha's name is Tengka Taihei.

591
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Welcome.

592
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
What's this?

593
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's a sacred temple.

594
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Is there a temple?

595
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's a temple of the Lord Yoshihara.

596
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is the temple.

597
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
There it is.

598
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Don't fly off.

599
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Aaron, the sh increasing foreingswith the Immortals,

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
committed near- Commissioner of the Buddha's foundation.

601
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It will command and strengthen the feeling when you axれて

602
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
of the heaven section to rein demonstrate its treatment.

603
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well said.

604
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Don't make any excuses.

605
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's nothing but mine, nothing at all!

606
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Misery it!

607
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Bring the things from the shop!

608
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Wait!

609
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Wait!

610
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You're also a fool!

611
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm going to take this shop's head to the shop!

612
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Bring it!

613
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yes!

614
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's Yoshibara's business.

615
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't care.

616
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
There are a lot of things in the dark!

617
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There's a good wind!

618
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're not?

619
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
No, I'm not.

620
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You're not the one who's going to take it?

621
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
No, I'm not.

622
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm not saying anything.

623
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Wait!

624
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Hey, wait!

625
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't think I can do this.

626
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'll definitely regret it!

627
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm a fool.

628
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Are you sure?

629
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

630
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Dad!

631
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Dad!

632
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What?

633
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Dad!

634
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Dad!

635
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Dad!

636
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Dad!

637
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Dad!

638
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Dad!

639
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Dad!

640
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Dad!

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The lyrics were written in the book,

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
so I had a conversation with the military office.

643
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I wanted to sell it, but the corner of the corner was hard.

644
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I was told that I could get the identity of this Maruya county.

645
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I usually search for the identity of the Maruya county,

646
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
but I found out that I was able to find the identity of the Maruya county

647
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
from the top of the mountain.

648
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I was helping Saguri.

649
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Mr. Hasegawa, you're in the military office now.

650
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
No, I'm in the military office.

651
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm in a hurry.

652
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I can't even show it to the military office.

653
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm selling it.

654
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Is that so?

655
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I knew it.

656
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I knew that my husband was in the military office,

657
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and that the lyrics were written in the book.

658
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I told him that I was in danger, but he didn't listen.

659
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I didn't tell him anything.

660
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I wanted to sell it somewhere in my heart.

661
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
If he's not here, I'll take it and sell it.

662
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Then, I'll sell it.

663
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm so wet.

664
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm so wet.

665
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I did it well.

666
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But I'm doing it well.

667
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'll fix it.

668
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm sorry.

669
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm just doing a bunch of dirty things.

671
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm not trying to get out of it or get in the way.

672
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm just doing it in the world.

673
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll be there soon.

674
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'll do this.

675
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Aowamachi?

676
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes.

677
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Aowamachi with wet hands.

678
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I tried to make a wet hand and a dirty hand.

679
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It means that you were brought up in a good story.

680
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm sure you did.

681
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What if I get something from someone?

682
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Thank you.

683
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Thank you very much.

684
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm sorry.

686
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm sorry.

690
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Hey.

693
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Mr. Urokono.

698
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Aowamachi with wet hands.

699
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Thank you very much.

700
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Itadakimasu.

701
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll make a sale-selling experiment.

702
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
This apple smell experiment.

703
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
A real entry achei-e zombies.

704
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And I'm sorry.

705
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's my mistake.

707
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm sorry!

708
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That's all for today!

709
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Great work today.

710
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Thank you very much.

711
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Thank you very much.
