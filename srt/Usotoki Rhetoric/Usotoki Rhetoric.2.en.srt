No, it's "our" work - as detective and assistant.

- This one.
- This one.

Say, let's give that a go.

51
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,950
This means true, and this means false.

52

- Try it for me.
- Huh?

53
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,430
- True.
- True.

54

And false.

55
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,780

- Great.

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,380
So, which is it?

59
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,010
You can't ask.

Fine.

63
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,860
Is it in this hand?

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,530
Nope.

65
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,580
Then is it in this one?

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,800
Nope.

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,870
I think it's in...

this hand.

One caramel for me.

Which hand has the caramel?

74

Is it in this one?

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,840
Nope.

76
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,390
But it is.

77

It's in this one.

80

It's in that one.

81
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,840
How could you tell?

82
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,640
- Wow!
- He's cheating.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,070
How can you tell?

84
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,020
If you must ask...

85
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,560
it's because I can tell when you're lying.

86
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,070
- No way.
- You're lying.

87
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,830
That's not possible!

88
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,960
He's definitely tricking us.

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,290

but now I see you both wear drabs.

185
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,240
You are paupers who have come to a household like ours,

186
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,490
yet wear clothes that are cheap, and slightly out of season.

187
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,170
Your hair is kept uncut, and without oil.

188
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,650
But your diet must be decent, given your complexion -

189
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,610
Chiyo. You must not be rude to our guests.

190
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,770
I'm terribly sorry for my daughter's behavior.

191
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,340
It's alright, she was entirely correct...

192
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,830
Was I?

193
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,630
A detective must see the details, after all.

194
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,060
- A detective?
- Indeed.

195
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,620
- "Shurei Bimoku"?
- "S-Shurei"?

196
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,540
"Hideyoshi Mayume".
<i>[T/N: Iwai and Kanoko have read the character's name wrongly]</i>

197
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,440
The beautiful, intelligent detective.

198
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,590
- I read the novel just yesterday.
- I see...

199
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,640
The bell! Where is Kokichi?

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,500
I cannot miss "The Beheading".

201
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,620
- The beheading?
- It's just a play.

202
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,010
The Nakamura Troupe have come to perform it at the nearby Wakatake Theatre.

203
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,300
Tickets have been hard to procure due to its popularity.

204
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,610
I see.

205
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,160
- My lady.
- Thank you.

206
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,240
- Kokichi.
- Yes?

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,270
These folk are the ones who almost had themselves run over by you.

208
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,950
Apologies for our carelessness.

209
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,490
Then I will be on my way.

210
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,090
I shall bring the car out front.

211
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,480
No need for that, I can walk there.

212
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,580
Chiyo, you mustn't.

213
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,000
Allow Kokichi to drive you.

214
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,790
But Mother, the theatre is only a walk away.

215
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,090
No. You will take the car.

216
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,000
- Kokichi.
- Yes, Madam.

217
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,240
Fine, then I shall take the car.

218
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,000
Good day to you both.

219
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,010
She is quite the lively individual, isn't she?

220
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,110
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

221
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,750
Castella...

222
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,100
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

223
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,650
Mr. Iwai. I hear you are a detective, yes?

224
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,360
Indeed, and she is my assistant.

225
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,850
Is that so?

226
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,200
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,710
If I may ask, detectives take on inquiries for lost items,

228
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,550
and resolve problematic incidents, correct?

229
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,630
- <i>Is something...</i>
- Is something on your mind, ma'am?

230
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,150
Allow me a guess.

231
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,670
Is this why you had Ms. Chiyo driven to the theatre in walking distance?

232
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,480
I see nothing escapes you, Mr. Detective.

233
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,050
Call my husband here at once.

234
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,060
Yes, Madam.

235
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,510
<i>It seems my first job as a detective's assistant is about to begin.</i>

236
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,210
Master Fujishima.

237
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,290
The missus calls for you.

238
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,670
Alright.

239
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,940
Please, sit.

240
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,760
The name's Yukihiro Fujishima - Oh.

241
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,430
I apologize for my daughter's crude attitude the other day.

242
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
So this is the concern?

243
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,140
Indeed. It was left upon our doorstep four days ago.

244
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,120
Though I have many competitors in business,
<i>[Yukihiro Fujishima. I will not forget what you have done.]</i>

245
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,770
I do not recall doing something so drastic to warrant such hate.

246
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,830
As such,

247
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,760
I personally believe this is only a prank.

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,230
Yet several days prior to this note, two suspicious looking men were seen loitering around our property.

249
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,330
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, Madam.

250
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,060
And when exactly did you witness these individuals?

251
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,030
It was the day I received a half day off.

252
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,520
Six days ago, to be exact.

253
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,240
They were peering into the manor.

254
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,140
What did these men look like?

255
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,760
One man wore a loose kimono, while the other wore a suit.

256
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
They were loitering out front,

257
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,970
- and kept peering inside the manor.
- <i>I'd say 30,000.</i>

258
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,600
- Frankly, they looked downright terrifying.
- <i>More like 50,000.</i>

259
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,990
A letter, and a pair of suspicious looking men...

260
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,000
- Are there any other leads?
- Not at the moment.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,120
Because there is no clear threat, we cannot call upon the police,

262
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,230
and there are no demands, which have left us at a loss.

263
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,400
I see. Ms. Chiyo is being escorted by car as a safety measure.

264
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,230
Indeed. It was Kokichi's proposition.

265
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,130
Mr. Kokichi is your family's exclusive chauffeur, correct?

266
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,790
Yes. He has been with us for seven years now.

267
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,600
He is a serious man, who takes great care of Chiyo.

268
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,260
- M-Master Fujishima!
- What's with the ruckus?

269
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,810
Here...

270
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,860
Dear?

271
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,720
"I have your daughter."

272
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,210
"Don't call the police."

273
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,990
"Do so, and your daughter is as good as gone."

274
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,670
<i>A kidnapping?</i>

275
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,330
"If you want your daughter back,

276
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,830
bring 8,300 yen to the Central Station within the next hour."
<i>[T/N: About 13,000,000 modern yen]</i>

277
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,470
Chiyo!

278
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,020
This uses the same paper, and handwriting as the previous note.

279
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,330
It was not a mere prank after all.

280
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,870
Within an hour?

281
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,910
But when did that hour begin?

282
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,270
When did you find this note?

283
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,430
Just now, when...

284
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,260
Master Fujishima... Madam...

285
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,850
- Kokichi!
- Where is Chiyo? What happened to her?

286
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,830
I am so terribly sorry, sir, ma'am!

287
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,260
Tell us, what happened?

288
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,440
My lady... my lady, she...

289
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,580
She has been kidnapped!

290
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,130
He's ly -

291
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,210
- Ly?
- What?

292
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,820
Nothing.

293
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,450
Kokichi, speak. What happened to our daughter?

294
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,120
I escorted Lady Chiyo to the front of the theatre,

295
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,190
and was waiting for her return in the parking lot,

296
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,140
when a man forced this letter upon me.

297
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,730
Shocked by its contents, I chased after the man.

298
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,720
However, I was then assailed by two men,

299
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,310
and lost them both in the struggle.

300
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,750
I have made an absolutely horrible blunder.

301
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,410
<i>None of that was true.</i>

302
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,640
Call the police, it must be those two men.

303
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,690
Dear, no! Chiyo will be...

304
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,640
- Master Fujishima, you mustn't.
- What?

305
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,380
Those two may be watching the manor as we speak.

306
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,990
<i>He lied, again.</i>

307
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,930
I see.

308
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,400
First, we have to find Ms. Chiyo.

309
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,410
Ms. Kanoko, I want you to continue signaling to me.

310
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,550
Yes, sir.

311
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,620
Mr. Kokichi.

312
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,930
The name's Iwai. I'm a detective.

313
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,270
A detective?

314
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,110
Yes. There is something I wish to ask you.

315
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,880
- Alright.
- According to your testimony, you did not see the kidnapping.

316
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,310
After you received the letter,

317
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,970
did you make sure to confirm Ms. Chiyo was gone?

318
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,180
Of course. I rushed into the theatre to find her,

319
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,020
but she was nowhere to be found.

320
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,740
Meaning Ms. Chiyo is not within the theatre, correct?

321
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,320
No, she is not.

322
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,510
I see. In that case -

323
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,480
Kokichi, get your wounds treated. We'll talk after.

324
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,020
Thank you, sir.

325
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,550
By god...

326
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,100
What have I done to deserve this?

327
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,430
Ma'am.

328
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,160
May I have a word?

329
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,170
Yes, of course.

330
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,930
- Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes?

331
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,050
Shall we?

332
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,530
What am I supposed to do?

333
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,680
Why exactly have you -

334
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,670
I have figured out Ms. Chiyo's whereabouts.

335
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,760
Say what?

336
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,990
- Ms. Chiyo is within the theatre.
- What?

337
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,130
I'll explain later.

338
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,700
Please head to the theatre, and bring Ms. Chiyo back at once.

339
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,840
- We shall.
- Madam, are you certain? This all sounds awfully suspicious...

340
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,150
No mother would abandon her daughter in need.

341
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,000
- Now let us be on our way.
- Yes, Madam.

342
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,760
Chiyo...

343
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,270
Sir, please stay calm.

344
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,380
I have lead an honest life.

345
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,730
I have not even hurt a soul.

346
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,720
Yet still there are people out there who curse me?

347
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,820
It is entirely possible to hurt others,

348
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,670
even if you meant no harm.

349
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,940
<i>Creepy. Creepy. Creepy.</i>

350
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,250
You could become the object of hate,

351
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,560
without even knowing how, or why.
<i>[Monster - Harbinger of Bad Luck]</i>

352
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,010
Without knowing?

353
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,610
T-That is why... Erm...

354
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,480
Sorry, it's nothing.

355
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,440
I must be going.

356
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,730
Sir, please wait!

357
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,980
But I must prepare the money.

358
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,080
Please wait until Mr. Iwai returns.

359
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,320
Sorry miss, but we're short on time.

360
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,560
Please, just a moment longer.

361
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,460
Will waiting patiently resolve the issue?

362
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
Sorry about that, miss.

363
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,850
Master Fujishima.

364
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,890
- Sir.
- Have you cleaned your wounds?

365
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,740
Yes. But we are running short on time.

366
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,740
If the "hour" our culprit mentioned

367
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,810
started when the play began...

368
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,600
You're entirely right.

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,380
Mr. Iwai...

370
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,030
Where's Mr. Fujishima?

371
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,950
Well, he...

372
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,450
Iwai.

373
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,120
I shall go hand off this money.

374
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,640
Mr. Fujishima.

375
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,120
Yes?

376
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,530
You ought to see if Ms. Chiyo is truly missing from the theatre

377
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,810
before meeting those demands.

378
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,930
Truly missing?

379
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,560
We already know she is.

380
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,090
Yes, but the theatre is grand, and quite crowded.

381
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,320
It is possible Mr. Kokichi simply overlooked her.

382
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,540
I would never.

383
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,470
My lady was missing, I am certain.

384
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,590
<i>He's lying.</i>

385
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,800
<i>Mr. Kokichi has been lying this whole time.</i>

386
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,540
I'm certain the situation left you in a panic.

387
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,750
Though, if you knew Ms. Chiyo's seat number -

388
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,800
Of course I knew Lady Chiyo's seat number.

389
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,270
That was the first place I checked.

390
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,750
Then maybe she was in the restroom?

391
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,010
- She was not.
- Really now.

392
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,260
<i>Mr. Iwai, why are you asking such circular questions?</i>

393
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,170
I asked those in neighboring seats about her as well.

394
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,430
But they said her seat had been empty the entire time.

395
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,240
Now that leaves us in a pickle.

396
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm sorry Iwai, but we have no time. I must be going.

397
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,690
- I shall accompany you, sir.
- No need.

398
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,970
- But sir -
- Hold it!

399
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,610
Mr. Fujishima.

400
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Please take a look over here.

401
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,160
Be sure to really look closely.

402
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,040
Now, what do these look like to you, sir?

403
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,480
They are castella, are they not?

404
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,560
Precisely. Now this over here is the castella I had been eating.

405
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,950
But what about this plate?

406
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,270
Well, this plate is the castella Ms. Kanoko had been eating.

407
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,450
Look at these two pieces of castella very, very carefully.

408
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,470
Now tell me, which piece is bigger?

409
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,280
- This one.
- Good eye, Mr. Fujishima.

410
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,310
Although we both began eating our castella at the same time,

411
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,900
Ms. Kanoko has significantly more cake left.

412
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,400
But Ms. Kanoko absolutely loves castella.

413
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,020
This would mean she ate slower than I did.

414
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,820
- Mr. Iwai?
- Ms. Kanoko loves castella.

415
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,910
So then why did she eat slowly? I shall tell you.

416
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,000
It is because castella is a delicacy to us poor folk,

417
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,190
and she felt the need to savor it.

418
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,360
And how is this relevant at present, Iwai?

419
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,470
It isn't.

420
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,040
- Pardon?
- I'm simply buying time.

421
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,580
Buying time? We <i>have</i> no time!

422
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,410
Yes, Lady Chiyo is in danger!

423
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,530
What exactly is going on?

424
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,600
Impossible. That was...

425
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,200
Finally.

426
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,380
- C-Chiyo?
- You have some gall to sound surprised.

427
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,410
How could you call for me during the play?

428
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,620
But you were kidnapped, were you not?

429
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,710
Kidnapped? Preposterous.

430
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,130
I was in the Wakatake Theatre this whole time.

431
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,840
What?

432
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,220
You heard her, Mr. Kokichi.

433
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,950
Kokichi? What happened to you?

434
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,370
I believe you told us Ms. Chiyo wasn't at the theatre, correct?

435
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,930
You mentioned you had checked her seat,

436
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,810
and asked those around about her as well.

437
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,210
Did you lie to us?

438
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,020
Why... Kokichi, why?

439
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,200
There were several things I found suspicious about this "kidnapping".

440
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,630
What?

441
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,510
First, the threat you were sent.

442
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,450
It demands that you prepare the money in an hour,

443
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,330
but that is barely any time at all.

444
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,520
You're right.

445
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,340
Why do you reckon the culprit was pressed for time?

446
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,040
It's actually quite simple.

447
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,540
The culprit wished to get this over with, before the play ended.

448
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,620
Because during that hour, Ms. Chiyo would remain stationary in the theatre.

449
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,860
The method this letter was delivered also tipped me off.

450
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,890
Our culprit should know how close the theatre is to the manor,

451
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,100
yet they chose to specifically hand the letter to Mr. Kokichi.

452
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,440
The culprit directly handed the letter to Kokichi,

453
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,790
despite the risk of making themselves known.

454
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,720
Yes, because they didn't want anyone here

455
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,980
to go check and see if Ms. Chiyo was actually in the theatre.

456
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,130
The threatening letter and news of Ms. Chiyo's kidnapping

457
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,650
had to arrive here, at the same time.

458
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,050
<i>Wow...</i>

459
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,120
<i>The lies and truths of this case are weaving into a clear picture.</i>

460
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,410
In other words, the kidnapping of Ms. Chiyo...

461
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,550
was a fabricated lie Mr. Kokichi fed us.

462
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,880
I don't believe it...

463
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,360
Then what of the two men who were peering into our abode?

464
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
You saw them, did you not?

465
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,510
- Yes, Madam.
- Was that also a lie?

466
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,880
No, we truly did see these suspicious individuals.

467
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,400
<i>Yes, the maids are telling the truth.</i>

468
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
Mr. Kokichi.

469
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,460
You know these two men.

470
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,460
No, I do not.

471
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,720
<i>He's lying.</i>

472
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:32,210
Were they threatening you for money, perhaps?

473
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,420
That would explain this whole debacle.

474
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,940
You fabricated a kidnapping

475
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,070
to get Mr. Fujishima to pay their demands.

476
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,800
Am I wrong?

477
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,060
You are.

478
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,430
I cannot stand to hear this slander.

479
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,890
- You are merely guessing.
- Chiyo.

480
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,720
What if Kokichi merely checked the wrong seat?

481
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,100
The culprit could be someone else.

482
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,200
Your logic is full of holes.

483
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,540
How can you say he lies, when you have no proof?

484
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,460
<i>Ms. Chiyo clearly holds unwavering faith in Mr. Kokichi.</i>

485
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,030
<i>Yet he used her trust, and lied...</i>

486
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,880
I have known Kokichi ever since I was a child.

487
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,680
Kokichi...

488
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,110
Kokichi would never do something so dastardly.

489
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,870
Believe him or not, if we've solved the case,

490
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,640
my job here is -

491
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,970
One moment please.

492
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,060
<i>I don't care if they look upon me with contempt.</i>

493
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,540
<i>I have to speak up, for Ms. Chiyo's sake.</i>

494
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,110
Mr. Kokichi is lying.

495
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,070
I can tell.

496
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,880
You can tell?

497
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,190
How so?

498
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,110
Well...

499
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,880
That is because...

500
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,240
I can detect -

501
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,300
Great work, Ms. Kanoko.

502
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,580
I'd expect nothing less from an assistant of mine.

503
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,190
Seems like she also caught onto Mr. Kokichi's lie.

504
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,140
It's like his quirk, if you will.

505
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,140
<i>Mr. Iwai?</i>

506
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,840
You have to keep your secret, right?

507
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,270
Well, don't keep us in suspense.

508
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,730
What lie did he tell?

509
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,440
I'd rather not say,

510
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,480
since it sounds pretty unbelievable.

511
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,810
- What?
- But I'll share, since it's an obvious tick.

512
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,460
Allow me to reveal to you all the trick

513
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,170
to spotting Mr. Kokichi's lie.

514
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,130
Whenever Mr. Kokichi lies...

515
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,970
his eyes flick down, and 45 degrees to the right.

516
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,790
Except, now that I've mentioned it,

517
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,780
he'll be overly conscious of this fact, and not react in this manner anymore.

518
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,270
I see.

519
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,570
Your logic is reasonable,

520
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,650
and I cannot imagine you are lying.

521
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,390
Kokichi, tell us. Is his deduction the truth?

522
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,620
Mr. Iwai is entirely correct.

523
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,840
I have lied to you all.

524
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,890
<i>People won't believe in something as baseless as having "mysterious powers".</i>

525
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,120
<i>But on the flip side,</i>

526
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,880
<i>a reason is all it takes for people to believe.</i>

527
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,420
Half a year ago,

528
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,450
I signed on as a guarantor for my elder brother,

529
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,060
to ensure he would repay the debt he accrued from adzuki bean stock.

530
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,280
However, just last month,

531
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,520
my brother passed on.

532
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,250
That was when those loansharks came to me,

533
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,110
- demanding that I repay the debt in his stead.
- <i>Kokichi.</i>

534
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,090
<i>You remember signing this, right?</i>

535
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,600
<i>We need that money back, and fast.</i>

536
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,720
<i>Say, the Fujishima's daughter is quite the cutie, eh?</i>

537
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,130
Although I had been repaying the debt bit by bit,

538
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,510
they suddenly demanded I pay in full by this month's end.

539
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,870
And if I failed to meet their demands,

540
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,270
they would kidnap Lady Chiyo, and sell her to who-knows-where.

541
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,770
I knew I had to protect Lady Chiyo, no matter what.

542
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,040
Even so, I had no way of scraping together the money they demanded by their deadline.

543
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,980
That was why I resorted to such foolish measures.

544
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,840
I see.

545
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,370
So you sent the Fujishima's this threat,

546
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,700
and drove Ms. Chiyo everywhere

547
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,010
so these men couldn't get to her.

548
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,950
I'm terribly sorry for my ridiculous actions.

549
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,140
You fool.

550
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,140
- Father, Kokichi was...
- Kokichi.

551
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,040
If only you were honest from the start.

552
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,070
This could have been resolved with ease.

553
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,450
Sir, I do not deserve your goodwill -

554
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,560
Why not?

555
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,810
Mr. Kokichi.

556
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,940
If you felt inclined to, you could have easily kidnapped Ms. Chiyo.

557
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,140
You could have even demanded the Fujishima's for ransom.

558
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,680
But instead, you chose to leave Ms. Chiyo out of harm's way.

559
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,980
Which incidentally also left your testimony riddled with holes for this detective to see through.

560
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,620
You inflicted yourself with an wound simply to sell the part,

561
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,040
and even demanded for 8,300 yen exactly.

562
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,960
What sort of honest fool would do that?

563
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,240
- A real idiot, that's who.
- Mr. Iwai!

564
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,020
And everyone here knows it.

565
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,970
They know you would never pull a stunt like this again.

566
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,020
He's right. You are the biggest fool I've met by far.

567
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,370
Master Fujishima...

568
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,590
I will spend the rest of my days repaying this favor and debt.

569
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,970
<i>I no longer sensed any lie from Mr. Kokichi's earnest vow.</i>

570
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,380
Thank you for your mercy and kindness.

571
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,550
How absolutely marvelous...

572
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,650
I now see what makes a true detective.

573
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,640
A hairstyle that defies all tradition.

574
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,220
Coupled with a get-up that challenges economic materialism.

575
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,790
Mr. Soma Iwai.

576
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,250
Your sleuthing rivals even that of the great Hideyoshi Mayume.

577
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,400
I am absolutely moved.

578
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,200
How ever shall we repay you?

579
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,030
With money.

580
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,140
A real professional till the end.

581
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,850
How wonderful!

582
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,400
I would like to repay your assistant as well.

583
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,610
- M-Me?
- Yes. Ask for anything.

584
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,260
Then if you know of any people with similar troubles,

585
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,620
please refer them to Detective Soma Iwai of Tsukumoyacho.

586
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,710
What a modest request you make.

587
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,920
But of course, I shall spread the word.

588
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,950
I'm terribly sorry to be a buzz-kill,

589
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,050
but I have to ask about those loansharks.

590
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,100
Do you reckon they'll truly back down, once you've repaid them?

591
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,040
Is there more to this case?

592
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,110
All I have to say, is that every truth has come to light.

593
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:10,030
Perhaps your family ought to tell the police about these "threats" you received.

594
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,390
Isn't that right?

595
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,870
Yes, sir.

596
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,660
Then let us see ourselves out, Ms. Kanoko.

597
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,360
Good day.

598
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,790
Thank you for visiting.

599
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,230
- Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes?

600
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,110
Let's have lunch.

601
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,400
Yes, let's.

602
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,500
This chestnut rice is delicious.

603
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,010
Delicious indeed.

604
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,600
Thank you again.

605
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,710
- Of course, come back anytime.
- Take care.

606
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,270
See you again.

607
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,090
That castella was delicious too.

608
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,060
Yes, I still think of it three days later.

609
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,580
If only I had eaten quicker.

610
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,670
I could have actually eaten both slices...

611
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,460
- Welcome in.
- Hello there.

612
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,230
Here for lunch as well?

613
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,660
Yes, although unlike you, I am paying my tab.

614
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,100
Hey, I have a growing tab too.

615
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,170
That isn't anything to be proud of.

616
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,340
What'll it be?

617
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,740
- I'll have some chestnut rice as well.
- Sounds great.

618
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,390
- I'll take your coat.
- Thank you.

619
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,040
Say,

620
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,760
what separates those that loath the rich, and those that do not?

621
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,010
Huh?

622
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,380
Some chumps we arrested yesterday

623
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,010
were extorting rich folks of their money.

624
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:03,780
A certain family reported that their chauffeur was being threatened to repay a debt.

625
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,190
Truth be told, we had a spike in similar cases recently.

626
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,650
Your chestnut rice.

627
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,500
Thank you.

628
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,800
Yet because this family reported their case,

629
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,310
we were able to capture these culprits,

630
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,550
and investigate their motives and persons.

631
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,340
<i>Matsukaze no Ginji.</i>

632
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,100
<i>You owe us a nice, long chat.</i>

633
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,830
Good for you.

634
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,630
You two.

635
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,180
Here's another dish on me.

636
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,450
Thanks Pops!

637
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,710
These wealthy families did not harm these men personally.

638
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,700
They simply wanted those with fortune to suffer.

639
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,660
It just means they can't stand to see folks

640
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,970
living life better than them.

641
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,050
I suppose deep hatred can spawn

642
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,890
even when one party has done no wrong.

643
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,460
Try a persimmon, Ms. Kanoko.

644
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,800
I heard the news from the Yaoroku's place.

645
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,250
You tossed that scoundrel to the ground?

646
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,700
- He did?
- Yes! I hear it was a spectacle.

647
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,360
It wasn't anything that impressive.

648
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,700
Oh? And what happened to those blokes afterwards?

649
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,760
Pardon me.

650
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,900
Oh, one moment.

651
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,210
Iwai. I must thank you for your help the other day.

652
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,960
Mr. Fujishima, you really shouldn't have.

653
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,400
Those men who were threatening Kokichi were arrested.

654
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,250
So I hear.

655
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,560
A friend in the police told me the news.

656
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,140
We owe everything to you, Iwai.

657
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,320
If you were not with us that day,

658
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,920
Kokichi and Chiyo may still have been in danger.

659
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,940
If I may ask, what became of Mr. Kokichi?

660
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,180
He remains as indebted to us as ever.

661
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,220
I will have him work for our family till his last breath.

662
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,260
That's good to hear.

663
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,430
Then I shall see myself out.

664
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,150
Say, Iwai.

665
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,790
Yes, sir?

666
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,800
Have you ever been the object of one's hatred?

667
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,460
Of course.

668
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,180
I'm quite the nuisance to some folks after all.

669
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,980
The other day, I had told Kokichi I wished he was honest from the start.

670
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,360
But I may have been the reason he hesitated to speak up in the first place.

671
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,200
Perhaps I had built a relationship

672
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,380
where Kokichi could not be honest without even realizing it.

673
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,270
Please send my regards to your assistant as well.

674
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,540
Ms. Kanoko.

675
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,240
You've been eavesdropping, have you not?

676
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,540
You could have joined us.

677
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,800
S-Sorry, sir.

678
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,710
- Still, great work.
- Huh?

679
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,020
Your first job was quite the success in my eyes.

680
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,240
You have no need to feel fear, or shame.

681
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:05,010
Your powers are truly an amazing thing.

682
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
Thank you, sir.

683
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,220
And if you needed proof, look.
<i>[Gratuity]</i>

684
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,710
We received these rewards thanks to your work.

685
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,550
F-Fifty yen!
<i>[T/N: About 80,000 modern yen]</i>

686
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,580
C-Castella!

687
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,050
Fifty!

688
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,460
This castella is the best I've seen!

689
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,230
Your powers are an amazing thing after all!

690
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,800
Hooray! So much castella!

691
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,490
Ms. Kanoko.

692
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,270
Here's to many more.

693
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,740
Yes, sir!

694
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,850
This looks amazing...

695
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,160
<i>This is how my first job as a detective's assistant</i>

696
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,650
<i>came to a case closed.</i>

697
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,410
One, two, three, four, fifty yen!

698
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,760
- One, two, three, four, fifty yen!
- Castella, castella, fifty yen...

699
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,190
<i>Dear Mother,</i>

700
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,310
<i>how have you been?</i>

701
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,160
<i>I am doing well.</i>

702
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,730
<i>I apologize for my lack of correspondence.</i>

703
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,560
<i>I have since become acquainted with a detective,</i>

704
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,440
<i>and now work as his live-in assistant.</i>

705
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,860
<i>Please don't worry about me.</i>

706
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,480
<i>I only hope that you stay healthy and well.</i>

707
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,430
<i>I'll write again.</i>

708
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,090
<i>From, Kanoko.</i>

709
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,530
