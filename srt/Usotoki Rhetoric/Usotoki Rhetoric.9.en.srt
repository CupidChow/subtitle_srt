[Tsukumoyacho - First Year of the Showa Era (1926)]

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,940
Dear Mother.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,700
I apologize I haven't written for so long.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,850
Seeing as it has become cold,

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,000
I hope you remain in good health.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,640
I am still working as a detective's assistant, in a quaint town.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,820
Thankfully, I have slowly gotten used to life here.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,430
Do not worry about me.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,020
I remain in good spirits.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,540
I promise I'll be fine out there,

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,390
Mother.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,220
If you ever find yourself in a tough patch,

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,530
you know you're welcome home anytime, right?

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,850
I miss my mother.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,590
But I'm also scared to see her.

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,840
I can't bring myself to address these letters from "Tsukumoyacho".
[Kanoko]

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,720
Excuse me.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,400
Ms. Chiyo!

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,930
Good day to you, Ms. Kanoko.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,680
Is Mr. Soma in?

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,860
Mr. Iwai is currently visiting our landlady.

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,120
Was there some sort of incident?

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,100
He has only gone to chop her firewood,

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,200
as we cannot afford rent this month.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,690
Then I shall wait until his return.

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,820
It's become chill out there, hasn't it?

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,580
- Enjoy.
- Thank you kindly.

28
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,500
How bland.

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,160
Rather, is this merely hot water?

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,670
Unfortunately, the grains I had for tea

31
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,760
dried out due to this cold.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,660
Then why not simply purchase tea leaves?

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,780
What are you doing, Mr. Iwai?

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,840
Are you not coming in?

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,770
Chiyo Fujishima is here, so no.

36
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,960
Why not? She came to visit.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,400
She's only trouble, I don't want to deal with her.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,210
Mr. Soma!

39
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,760
Good day...

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,920
I have come today with a job for you.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,280
- A job?
- Indeed.

42
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,380
Mr. Iwai.

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,060
An acquaintance of my father has trouble on their hands,

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,600
and wishes to employ your services.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,200
An acquaintance of your father.

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,850
Does that mean they're rich?

47
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,400
Yes, I suppose so. Why, does that trouble you?

48
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,890
He's merely concerned about... the potential compensation.

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,840
Do not worry, the client will compensate you for your work.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,130
The one who requests your aid is Mrs. Sanehara.

51
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,130
Mrs. Sanehara...

52
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,230
Mr. Sanehara, her husband and former diplomat,

53
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,950
unfortunately passed away this summer.

54
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,020
What sort of trouble does this Mrs. Sanehara have?

55
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,580
It has something to do with her family.

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,050
I believe it would be best to hear from her directly.

57
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,000
Could you take on her case?

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,640
I can't say without knowing the details.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,120
We ought to take this job, sir.

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,340
Ms. Chiyo's father recommended us to his acquaintance.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,960
This would do well to earn us reputation, and trust.

62
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,170
I suppose I can hear her out.

63
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,540
Tatsuzo left poor Yoshie behind, and waltzed off to Kyoto on his own.

64
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,140
Kyoto? That sounds wonderful.

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,470
He went to attend the wedding of an old friend.

66
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,800
You should have joined him with Taro.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,420
Taro has school.

68
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,630
And if I closed shop for long,

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,170
you and Kanoko would starve.

70
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,770
Take that to them.

71
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,530
Thank you, Taro.

72
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,630
You're excellent help.

73
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,070
Feeding a jobless detective meals for free?

74
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,490
This store is one in a million.

75
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,780
Yes. Thank you, really.

76
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,040
Let's do our best on this job, so we can repay all our tabs.

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Ms. Kanoko, you're spilling a trade secret!

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,810
You finally got yourself a client?

79
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,450
I guess nothing's truly impossible.

80
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,490
You'd best work hard, Mr. Iwai.

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,810
I'll be waiting with your unpaid tab.

82
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,970
How much money will be left for me?

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,580
I apologize for all this trouble, Ms. Chiyo.

84
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,050
Please, it's no trouble.

85
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,000
With Auntie Sanehara coming,

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,480
we cannot have you serve lukewarm water

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,330
in shoddy tea cups after all.

88
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,470
Auntie is usually quite punctual.

89
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,200
I believe she should arrive shortly.

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,610
- Good day to you all.
- Auntie.

91
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,610
My name is Hisa Sanehara.

92
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,940
I am her secretary, Nagasawa.

93
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,260
My name is Soma Iwai.

94
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,770
This is my assistant, Kanoko Urabe.

95
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm pleased to meet you, Madame.

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,580
And I am the referrer, Chiyo Fujishima.

97
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,530
We are well aware.

98
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,250
Auntie, please have a seat.

99
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,570
Thank you, Chiyo.

100
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,140
Thank you again for coming all this way.

101
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,560
It was no trouble. I quite enjoy taking strolls.

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,960
Your attire is lovely, Madame.

103
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,730
My husband was an enjoyer of western fashions.

104
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,920
- Nagasawa.
- Yes, ma'am.

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,400
Your payment in advance.

106
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,770
We shall choose to take on this case, after hearing the specifics.

107
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,660
Would you tell us your request, Madame?

108
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,280
Of course.

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,620
Chiyo, I'm terribly sorry. But I must ask...

110
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,020
Pardon?

111
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,330
I alone have been cast out from the group.

112
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,170
My lady, I would not call it that...

113
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,520
I thought this would be my chance to see a detective at work.

114
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,670
I imagine Mrs. Sanehara's request has to do with secretive family matters.

115
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,440
Yes, I understand.

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,200
This is a staple of novels.

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,240
A key individual aids the detective, without knowing the circumstances.

118
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,980
Yes, that is who I must be.

119
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,730
Apologies, my lady. But I know very little about mystery novels...

120
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,500
No matter, I shall play my role perfectly!

121
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,850
My lady!

122
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,560
This is a portrait of my only daughter, Eri.

123
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,480
She is a beautiful individual.

124
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,990
She looks just as I did, when I was a young lass.

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,900
I see your daughter is with your husband now.

126
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,760
Did Ms. Chiyo tell you?

127
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,810
No, she did not divulge your familial circumstances.

128
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,800
I apologize for my bluntness,

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
but this individual is far too young to be your daughter.

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,970
Although the photograph itself is also quite old,

131
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,590
you never stated this was a photograph from her childhood.

132
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,560
As her direct family,

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
I imagine you do not have a more recent picture, because...

134
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,750
Indeed. Eri departed this world 24 years ago.

135
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,710
You've shown us a photograph of your daughter,

136
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,250
and even divulged us a memory I imagine causes you great pain.

137
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,390
I surmise your request has something to do with her?

138
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,620
It seems nothing gets past a detective's keen eye.

139
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,600
Then I shall tell you both my full tale.

140
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,710
Please do.

141
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,640
[Usotoki Rhetoric]
[Episode 9]

142
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,920
This all began 25 years ago.

143
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,270
Eri, who was 19 years young,

144
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,730
fell in love with a man named Otokichi Yamaoka,

145
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,030
who was my husband's disciple.

146
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,450
You ungrateful swine!

147
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,350
Father, please! Stop this!

148
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,040
Eri!

149
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,290
Leave us at once!

150
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,800
Do not set foot here ever again!

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,570
My husband, who caught wind of their love,

152
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,850
chased out Mr. Otokichi in a fit of absolute rage.

153
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,610
My husband then had Eri be betrothed to another individual.

154
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,440
However...

155
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,360
The night before their wedding,

156
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,330
Eri had eloped with Mr. Otokichi.

157
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,540
I wanted to search for Eri as soon as possible.

158
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,620
But my husband treated her as good as dead.

159
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,930
All I could do was pray for Eri's safety.

160
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,900
Earlier this summer, my husband passed due to a sudden illness.

161
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,340
It was as I was sorting through his belongings,

162
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,710
that I found these documents.

163
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,390
What do they entail?

164
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,150
They are the records of a search sent out for Eri and Mr. Otokichi.

165
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,220
The documents date back to half a year after they eloped.

166
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,380
According to these records,

167
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,810
Eri moved to a small mountainside village called Yanashirocho, under the name Tsuruko.

168
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,220
She lived a humble life with Mr. Otokichi,

169
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,300
who had started an English class.

170
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,480
So your husband worried for Ms. Eri as well.

171
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,060
Worried? No, I reckon he tried to drag her back home.

172
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,020
But Eri knew better.

173
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,360
That is why she discarded the name we, her parents, gave her.

174
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,020
I imagine my husband was furious to hear of her predicament.

175
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,520
To hear she had found happiness.

176
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,790
After all, the search ends there.

177
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,520
But our family lawyer, Mr. Kamishiro,

178
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,220
wished to hear from her regarding my husband's inheritance.

179
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,150
As such, he visited Yanashirocho to find Eri.

180
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,380
This is when we learn that one year after my husband's search,

181
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,570
Mr. Otokichi had passed away due to a raging epidemic.

182
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,360
Eri, who was left to fend on her own,

183
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,670
pushed herself to make ends meet.

184
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,480
When she gave birth to the child who would be my grandson,

185
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,220
her body gave way, and she too passed away.

186
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,380
I was not given the opportunity

187
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,810
to reunite with my daughter.

188
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,040
Eri had given birth to a boy.

189
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,540
He was taken in by a couple named the Hirata's, who were good friends of Mr. Otokichi.

190
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,870
We were able to figure out they moved to a town called Inabuki,

191
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,920
a place not so far from Yanashirocho.

192
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,980
Yet we reached another dead end.

193
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,290
This town of Inabuki suffered a great landslide 20 years ago.

194
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,120
The Hirata's were two of the many lives lost in this tragedy.

195
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,550
Eri's child, who was five at the time, had also gone missing.

196
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,500
Yet any semblance of a town registry was lost to the disaster.

197
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,980
As such, I do not even know my grandson's name.

198
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,590
So is your request to search for this grandson of yours?

199
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,360
No.

200
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,780
My grandson has already been found.

201
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,750
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

202
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,950
Mr. Kamishiro put out a missing persons posting in the paper.

203
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,860
That is when one month ago, a young man named Shiro Tokuda

204
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,480
came to inquire Mr. Kamishiro of this post.

205
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,770
This man claims he lost the Hirata's within the disaster,

206
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,400
and had since been in the care of various institutes.

207
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,290
He also knew of his mother's name "Tsuruko",

208
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,760
which we purposefully kept from the missing persons post.

209
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,660
At long last, I had been reunited with my grandson.

210
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,530
However, a mere week later,

211
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:51,820
another young man arrived who claimed he, too, was raised by the Hirata's in Inabuki.

212
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,910
He was found wandering the disaster grounds by his current parents,

213
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,830
and was adopted into the family,

214
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,800
under the name "Satsuki Honjo".

215
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,500
Was Mr. Satsuki also aware of the name "Tsuruko"?

216
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,030
Indeed.

217
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,690
That name is our only lead.

218
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,520
But those two young men are beautiful, just like my daughter.

219
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,410
And we all know beauty is a gene that passes on.

220
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,940
Then your request would be...

221
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,720
Yes. I would like you to determine which of those two men is Eri's son.

222
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,220
Do not misunderstand. I do not feel pity for Eri, nor wish to apologize to her.

223
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,810
She chose that life for herself, after all.

224
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:50,960
I simply wish to know who is my grandson - the truth, as it may be.

225
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,880
Even though you could take your pick, as things stand?

226
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,640
Mr. Iwai!

227
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,420
It is a rather fateful encounter.

228
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,930
We could continue to stay in good terms, indeed.

229
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,910
But the one who is not Eri's son has a real grandmother.

230
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,470
It would be disrespectful of me to take their grandson away.

231
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:22,040
I was not able to do a single thing for this child...

232
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,140
I plan to invite Mr. Shiro and Mr. Satsuki to my manor next week.

233
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,930
Please, join us in our festivities.

234
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,110
You may come for dinner, and ask them anything you need.

235
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,910
- Dinner?
- We would be honored.

236
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,840
I will have those two stay for a while,

237
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,420
so I ask that you determine the truth during their stay.

238
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,790
Understood.

239
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,710
We'll see what we can do.

240
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,260
Is there something else on your mind?

241
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,380
I shall take my leave for today.

242
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,560
Oh my, it has begun to snow.

243
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,810
The first snow of the season.

244
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,450
I bid you both the best of luck.

245
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,430
Thank you again, and farewell.

246
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,090
♪ Free dinner, free dinner, oh joyous day ♪
[One week later]

247
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,340
♪ Free dinner, free dinner, oh joyous day ♪

248
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,090
- ♪ Will it be omelettes, or - ♪
- Pardon my intrusion.

249
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,810
- Ms. Chiyo?
- What gives?

250
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,620
I knew it. Are you both wearing rags to Mrs. Sanehara's manor?

251
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,670
We've prepared our best clothes.

252
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,240
According to Auntie,

253
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,700
you have both been invited to dinner?

254
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,950
Well, those rags are absolutely unsightly.

255
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,710
"Unsightly"?

256
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,340
Please carry those to the second floor.

257
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,410
Yes, my lady.

258
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,430
- Pardon us.
- What the -

259
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,300
H-Huh?

260
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,060
Ms. Kanoko, onwards.

261
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,940
What?

262
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,420
Chiyo Fujishima... What are you plotting?

263
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,210
Now then, let us begin.

264
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,070
Mr. Iwai, you must get dressed as well.

265
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,060
We've borrowed a suit from Master Fujishima.

266
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,620
I've never worn make up before.

267
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,940
It is a must for any fine lady.

268
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,810
That tickles...

269
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,970
Come now, stay still.

270
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,290
She is ready!

271
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,830
Oh my. You did not get changed, Mr. Soma?

272
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,280
- I prefer my usual suit.
- A shame.

273
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,650
Our apologies, my lady.

274
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,540
No matter, Ms. Kanoko looks swell. See?

275
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,330
Oh?

276
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,330
Ms. Kanoko?

277
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,780
She was right.

278
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,240
You look very cute, Ms. Kanoko.

279
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,200
Why won't you come down?

280
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,990
It's nothing, really.

281
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,570
It really was nothing.

282
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,530
I was embarrassed by his statement, without an ounce of a lie,

283
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,820
but all that flew away to nothing.

284
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,720
Well then, Ms. Kanoko.

285
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,350
Yes, sir?

286
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,000
Shall we make way to Mrs. Sanehara's dinner?

287
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,800
Yes, sir.

288
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,100
Thank you for coming all this way, despite the chill.

289
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,060
My, you look wonderful today.

290
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,140
Thank you very much.

291
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,420
Please, come on in.

292
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,510
- Are you alright?
- Sorry, sir.

293
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,690
I'm still not used to wearing heels.

294
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,320
Many apologies for my tardiness.

295
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
Mr. Kamishiro.

296
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,090
Ah, you must be the rumored detective.

297
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,500
I am the Sanehara's lawyer, Kamishiro.

298
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,400
- Pleased to meet you, lad.
- Likewise.

299
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,530
Yes, yes. A pleasure indeed.

300
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,780
- I am his assistant -
- Pleased to meet you, too.

301
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,210
Now then, I have brought our two other guests.

302
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,110
The ones you must pick apart.

303
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,860
Come on in, lads.

304
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,820
This is the detective Mr. Iwai, and this is his... assistant?

305
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,100
Yes. My name is Kanoko Urabe.

306
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:37,930
Right, and this is Shiro Tokuda, and Satsuki Honjo.

307
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,420
Mrs. Sanehara makes a point. They are indeed handsome.

308
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,220
Ms. Kanoko...

309
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,030
It was not me this time!

310
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,880
Was it you, sir?

311
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm sorry, but that was me.

312
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,570
Lunch was quite early, you see...

313
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,580
You ate three whole servings for lunch.

314
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,610
One serving only holds for one hour.

315
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,120
Although it is early, let us prepare for dinner.

316
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,080
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,330
Please, make your way to the dining hall.

318
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,810
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,250
Your hand?

320
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,550
Thank you.

321
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,570
Folks, you are in for a treat! A Sanehara dinner is a real luxury.

322
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,250
Sounds wonderful.

323
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,970
I haven't had such a crowd in ages.

324
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,230
Now then, let us make way.

325
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,310
The wine here is also sublime.

326
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,090
They both seem like gentle and kind individuals.

327
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,650
Excuse me.

328
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,630
Could I ask for both your names once more?

329
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,650
Of course. Apologies for cutting introductions short due to my hunger.

330
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,030
My name is Satsuki Honjo. I currently work as a gardener's apprentice.

331
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,200
I am the one who came to Mrs. Sanehara afterwards.

332
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,470
He's not lying.

333
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,110
Don't let a matter of visiting first or second worry you, Satsuki.

334
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,820
My name is Shiro Tokuda.

335
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,220
I work as a backstage handler at a theatre in Asakusa.

336
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,890
He's lying.

337
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,050
This one is the fake.

338
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,370
You there, Ms. Assistant.

339
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,440
What was your name again?

340
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,340
Kanoko Urabe, sir.

341
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,080
That surprised me.

342
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,000
Mr. Iwai, and Ms. Kanoko.

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,970
I look forward to our conversations to come.

344
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,690
We've found the lie.

345
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,260
This is a piece by Takeji Fujishima, yes?

346
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,130
My, what a sharp eye.

347
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,670
Thank you, ma'am.

348
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,600
The question is, how do we prove it?

349
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,050
Thank you.

350
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,480
What is the proper way to eat this?

351
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,140
I'm sorry, I wasn't taught etiquette.

352
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,600
You're free to dine however you'd like.

353
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,800
Thank you.

354
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,890
This is delicious!

355
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,760
Mr. Satsuki, Mr. Shiro. Is this the first time -

356
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,090
Delicious wine, I say.

357
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,660
You two have met?

358
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,840
- Yes.
- As the lad says.

359
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,220
I've talked with them separately,

360
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,810
and ran background checks on both.

361
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,530
Although, seeing as we were both raised in Inabuki,

362
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,280
it's possible we ran into each other at least once.

363
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,660
Every claim Mr. Shiro makes is a lie.

364
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,880
Inabuki was a trade town, with people always coming to and fro.

365
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,470
That's another reason why so many went missing during the disaster.

366
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,300
Mr. Shiro, when did you join your current theatre as a stagehand?

367
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,380
He started just this spring.

368
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,660
And before this theatre?

369
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,800
He worked at a dance hall in Yokohama.

370
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,490
I worked as a guard, and did odd jobs around the dance hall.

371
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,730
This is another lie.

372
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,330
You can trust Shiro on his job history.

373
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,970
I made sure to look into it, after all.

374
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,800
I even made you a booklet with all their information.

375
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,460
Sure hope it helps your investigating.

376
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,500
There.

377
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,270
Mr. Kamishiro, I'm sure Mr. Iwai would like to ask his own questions.

378
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,440
No need, I've written everything down here.

379
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,110
With all due respect, sir,

380
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,970
Mr. Iwai would most likely want to hear from us directly.

381
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,770
Mr. Iwai, if you have any other questions, go right on ahead.

382
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,810
Thank you, but I'll start by reading through this booklet.

383
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,350
- On that note, Mr. Satsuki.
- Yes?

384
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,420
Were you named "Satsuki" for a certain reason?
[T/N: Satsuki - a type of azalea; blooms in early summer]

385
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,900
Perhaps you were born in early summer?
[T/N: Satsuki - a type of azalea; blooms in early summer]

386
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,510
No, I was born in winter.

387
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,190
I was named after an embroidery found on my back.

388
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,420
As in, the thing a mother sews on the back of her child's kimono

389
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,430
to ward off bad spirits?

390
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,440
Precisely.

391
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,770
My mother had embroidered a Satsuki azalea

392
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,130
onto my baby clothes.

393
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,740
The Hirata's gave me the name, since I had no other memory of my mother.

394
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,770
Then the person who embroidered this image was "Tsuruko"?

395
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,950
Yes.

396
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,210
And those baby clothes?

397
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,240
I treasured it greatly, but...

398
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,430
He lost it all to the disaster.

399
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,940
- A true loss, in many senses.
- Mr. Iwai, steady.

400
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,700
Though I'm surprised, Mrs. Hisa.

401
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,890
You hadn't told Mr. Iwai about the embroidery yet?

402
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,450
Yes.

403
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,450
I was short on time the other day, and couldn't get around to it.

404
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,420
She's lying?

405
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,450
Mr. Shiro, do you know anything of this embroidery?

406
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,710
No, not in particular.

407
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,240
That was true.

408
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,550
He -

409
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,100
He hasn't caught on, right?

410
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,300
I was so nervous.

411
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,660
I couldn't even savor the good food.

412
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,430
Everything Mr. Shiro said was a lie, including his name, right?

413
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,490
Yes. I wish we could have heard more from them.

414
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,980
That Mr. Kamishiro kept answering before they could speak,

415
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,400
not to mention he got Mr. Satsuki absolutely drunk.

416
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,740
The man would not leave me alone.

417
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,330
I'm almost thankful Mr. Shiro kept Mr. Kamishiro company.

418
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,620
He was especially pushy because you declined the wine.

419
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,770
It certainly left no room for investigating.

420
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,260
We know Mr. Shiro is lying.

421
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,650
But the issue is how we prove it.

422
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,980
I suppose the most obvious answer would be to find the real "Shiro Tokuda".

423
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,620
The real one?

424
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,020
Then our "Shiro Tokuda" isn't using a fake name,

425
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,340
he's impersonating a real "Shiro Tokuda"?

426
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,320
Otherwise Mr. Kamishiro would have no background to check.

427
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,950
There's a real "Shiro Tokuda" out there, who hails from Inabuki,

428
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,910
and likely changes jobs frequently.

429
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,680
I'd bet our fake "Shiro" was close to the real thing,

430
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,720
and used the real one's background to his benefit.

431
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,780
If he lied about working for a dance hall,

432
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,610
then the one who worked at the dance hall, is the real one.

433
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,610
That means we could search for this real "Shiro".

434
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,040
I guess...

435
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,910
Your expression says "this is only trouble".

436
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,470
Yeah...

437
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,570
And I see your heart agrees.

438
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,530
So we can prove the fake by finding the real.

439
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,730
But there's one other lie I'm curious about.

440
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,820
If we can unravel that mystery, this case may be solved.

441
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,970
You're talking about Mrs. Hisa's lie, yes?

442
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,500
I was short on time the other day, and couldn't get around to it.

443
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,800
I think Mrs. Hisa already has a hunch about who is Eri's son.

444
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,980
Mrs. Hisa most likely believes her real grandson...

445
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,460
is Satsuki Honjo.

446
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,460
Mr. Shiro is certainly a fake,

447
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,950
and Mr. Satsuki was not lying either.

448
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,500
But how could Mrs. Hisa know?

449
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,090
Before we go there, consider the fact they could both be fakes.

450
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,540
A third, or fourth man claiming to be her grandson could appear.

451
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,270
But from the way Mrs. Hisa described her predicament,

452
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,390
it was as if she absolutely knew one of them was her grandson.

453
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,120
She even convinced you of this as well.

454
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:37,090
I would like you to determine which of those two men is Eri's son.

455
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,830
You're right, she did.

456
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,960
And there's one other thing.

457
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,570
Are you referring to Mr. Satsuki's embroidery?

458
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:50,920
This information directly ties him to his mother, Tsuruko.

459
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,850
Yet Mrs. Hisa did not tell you about it.

460
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,430
If her claim about running short on time was false,

461
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,540
that means she had the time,

462
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,680
and specifically chose to keep silent about it.

463
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,070
Something about Mr. Satsuki's "Satsuki azalea" embroidery

464
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,140
proves that he is not her grandson.

465
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,680
Mrs. Hisa didn't mention this, because she believes Mr. Satsuki is her grandson.

466
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,640
Could it not be the other way around?

467
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,240
For example, the embroidery proves Mr. Satsuki is her grandson,

468
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,990
yet she kept quiet because she wants to believe Mr. Shiro is her real grandson.

469
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,630
Except, we don't know what Mr. Shiro's mother embroidered him.

470
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,650
It could have been a "Satsuki azalea" as well.

471
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,560
Which is why Mrs. Hisa can't rule Mr. Shiro out of the picture.

472
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,110
To summarize...

473
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:46,540
With only Mr. Satsuki's embroidery as a clue, we can presume...

474
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,820
That either both of them could be her grandson,

475
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,660
or that Mr. Satsuki is not her grandson.

476
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,820
But Mrs. Hisa kept quiet about the embroidery, which means...

477
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,920
She doesn't want to dismiss Mr. Satsuki as a potential grandson!

478
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,550
Mr. Iwai is amazing.

479
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,550
Mrs. Hisa believes Mr. Satsuki is her real grandson.

480
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,360
She must have her reasons for thinking so.

481
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,470
I wanted to ask around about that, but alas.

482
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,000
I wonder how long Mr. Kamishiro is going to remain at Mrs. Hisa's manor.

483
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
He'll definitely be there tomorrow.

484
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,560
I bet he'll drink until morning.

485
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,970
Let's have Ms. Chiyo call Mrs. Hisa about this.

486
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,020
I shall ask Ms. Chiyo to make the call.

487
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,190
I owe you one, Ms. Kanoko.

488
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,250
Good day.

489
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,130
Thank you again for coming to us.

490
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,750
It's simply for the better.

491
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,570
Mr. Kamishiro means no harm though, of course.

492
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,490
Oh, I truly am ashamed of myself.

493
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,540
I vowed to remain neutral to them both, and yet.

494
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,240
Mr. Kamishiro knows of Mr. Satsuki's embroidery,

495
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,170
of course I cannot keep it under wraps.

496
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:19,280
What exactly made you believe Mr. Satsuki was your grandson?

497
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,340
Intuition.

498
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,520
I have no other reason, really.

499
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,790
My name is Satsuki Honjo. It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.

500
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,560
The first time I saw Mr. Satsuki's face,

501
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,980
I simply knew he was Eri's child.

502
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,340
And yet...

503
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,080
The embroidery was different.

504
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,350
But the fact you know it's different,

505
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:48,920
means there's a pattern Eri would have sown for her child?

506
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,660
Indeed.

507
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,960
When she took embroidery lessons at school,

508
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,700
Eri had made note of it.

509
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,320
She said she would sew a crane,

510
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,400
like I had once done for her own childhood clothes.

511
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,080
A crane...
[T/N: crane is "Tsuru" in Japanese]

512
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,520
But Mr. Satsuki's embroidery was a Satsuki azalea.

513
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,660
I was only reminded of Eri's embroidery,

514
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,560
once Mr. Satsuki made note of his.

515
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,760
Ms. Eri also named herself after the crane, with her alias "Tsuruko".

516
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,430
If Eri had called herself "Tsuruko" because of her own embroidery,

517
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,800
then I believe she would also sew a crane for her child.

518
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,310
But of course, this is all conjecture.

519
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,970
It's practically no clue at all.

520
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,760
A crane...

521
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,400
Would an embroidery of a crane...

522
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,840
Thank you.

523
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:58,580
Look a bit like... this?

524
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,580
What do you say, sir?

525
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,670
This is a crane?

526
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,460
Yes. A paper crane.

527
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,610
I think it looks a little more like this.

528
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,420
Yes, that's it!

529
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,120
Mr. Iwai, you're an artist.

530
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,300
It seems we each have our own interpretations of a crane.

531
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,400
Allow me to share the crane I embroidered for Eri.

532
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,930
Thank you.

533
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,540
Ma'am?

534
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,720
Could it be?

535
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,610
Oh, that child...

536
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,900
Eri was never one for details, you see.

537
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,000
How very interesting.

538
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,460
Let us go see for ourselves.

539
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,300
Yes. To the manor.

540
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,880
Let us go see what, exactly?

541
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,850
Where is Mr. Satsuki?

542
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,700
He drank himself into a stupor yesterday.

543
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,080
He has yet to wake.

544
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,670
My, is he alright?

545
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,690
Mr. Kamishiro, you ought to have given the boy a warning.

546
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,450
I'm terribly sorry, I'll call for him right away!

547
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,630
Please, come on in.

548
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,030
I see you're wearing a kimono today.

549
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,230
Or perhaps this is your usual attire?

550
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,930
Yes, sir.

551
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,480
What is it you wish to ask Satsuki?

552
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,720
I shall wait until he joins us.

553
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,610
Have you perhaps found a clue?

554
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,820
Ms. Kanoko doesn't know a thing.

555
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,210
I'm sorry to have kept you.

556
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,660
Mr. Satsuki, I have a question for you.

557
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,030
Could you join us here?

558
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,630
Yes, sir.

559
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,730
Now then, what is about to begin?

560
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,280
Yesterday, you made note of a Satsuki azalea embroidery

561
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,630
you were then named after.

562
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,480
Would you happen to remember what that looked like?

563
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,460
Yes, I do.

564
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,900
Could you please illustrate it for us?

565
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,660
Of course.

566
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,370
What's all this about, Iwai?

567
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,520
Ms. Eri wanted to sew for her child

568
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,980
the subject Mrs. Hisa had once sewn onto her own clothing.

569
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,450
Yes, but was that not a crane?

570
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,520
- Indeed.
- And Satsuki's embroidery was...

571
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,280
There.

572
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,970
It was a flower, shaped like so.

573
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,350
Is this not a Satsuki azalea?

574
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:13,540
This is the embroidery Mrs. Hisa had sewn for Eri.

575
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,780
Unbelievable!

576
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,320
They look very similar.

577
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,850
My, what a riot!

578
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:30,210
Yes, this is a terribly clumsy crane.

579
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,890
It seems her eye for detail, or lack thereof, never improved.

580
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:41,140
Then Satsuki is Ms. Eri's real son?

581
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,360
Mr. Shiro's mother may have also embroidered him a crane.

582
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,330
I say we ask him once more about...

583
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,040
Where's Mr. Shiro?

584
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,430
Sir?

585
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,030
Sir!

586
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,700
Mr. Iwai!

587
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,250
Are you alright, Mr. Detective?

588
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,700
Who are you?

589
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,570
I already introduced myself, didn't I?

590
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,280
Though I will admit, I am not that woman's grandson.

591
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,110
You are not the real Shiro Tokuda.

592
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,650
Who exactly are you?

593
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,360
You caught on, after all.

594
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,320
I'm impressed.

595
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,230
How could you tell?

596
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,940
So you admit it.

597
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,010
There's no reason to stall.

598
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:57,780
I'm dealing with a keen detective and his assistant, after all.

599
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,640
Where is the real Shiro Tokuda?

600
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:08,010
I'm not a fan of that dour look.

601
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,550
Worry not, I haven't killed the man.

602
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,750
He changes occupations often.

603
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,110
I merely slipped into those cracks.

604
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,950
"Killed"?

605
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,410
Mr. Iwai even considered the possibility of murder?

606
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,250
Your expression says "this is only trouble".

607
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,550
He was thinking this was trouble, for other reasons.

608
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,680
You pretended to be this "Shiro Tokuda", and even attempted to become Ms. Eri's son.

609
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,040
Indeed.

610
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,010
But since Satsuki also came forth,

611
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,620
I was honestly wondering what to do.

612
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,310
Once I heard they were calling a detective,

613
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,950
I was intrigued to see how they would tell us apart.

614
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,240
That is why I came to the manor at all.

615
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,040
There is no point to being "Shiro Tokuda" any more.

616
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,480
It's time I take my leave.

617
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,630
I'm glad Satsuki was proven to be the real grandson.

618
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,870
He is a good man.

619
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,920
Rest assured,

620
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,840
I will no longer meddle with the Sanehara family.

621
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,590
Ms. Kanoko.

622
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,760
What's your verdict on my story?

623
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,620
Farewell.

624
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,470
That man wasn't Shiro Tokuda?

625
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,690
No, that's impossible.

626
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,210
I ran a background check on him.

627
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:55,360
There was most likely a "Shiro Tokuda" working at a dance hall in Yokohama, yes.

628
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,170
But did you go looking for a face?

629
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,240
No, I did not go that far.

630
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,700
I sent a request to the dance hall themselves,

631
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,670
but they had no photograph of this "Shiro Tokuda" either.

632
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,610
So instead, they sent us a sketch of his visage.

633
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,030
That is certainly not the man we spoke to.

634
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,510
This fake "Shiro Tokuda"

635
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,310
built his very being upon lies.

636
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,780
- Except, back then...
- I'm glad Satsuki was proven to be the real grandson.

637
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,760
Mr. Shiro...

638
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,600
He is a good man.

639
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,940
...spoke only the truth.

640
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,330
- Mr. Satsuki.
- Yes, ma'am.

641
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,710
I have not been there for you in your times of need.

642
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,950
And for this, I truly apologize.

643
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:52,070
Would you allow me to cherish you as family, for Eri as well?

644
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,620
Please do.

645
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,960
No, that's not quite right.

646
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,620
What do I say in situations like these?

647
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,000
He's free to do as he likes, was it?

648
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,840
Indeed.

649
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,770
In that case...

650
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,330
I would also like for us to be on good terms.

651
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,830
Please allow me to tend to your garden, Grandmother.

652
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,760
Satsuki.

653
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:30,430
By unraveling the truth of Mrs. Hisa's own lie,

654
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,600
Mr. Iwai closed yet another case.

655
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,740
Tsuruko and Satsuki.

656
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,400
The two names interwoven into a mother's embroidery

657
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,010
brought this fraying family back together.

658
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:01,490
Here's your steamed sushi, and boiled taro and codfish.

659
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,410
And since you paid your tab,

660
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,600
I'm giving you some pickled radishes, as a bonus.

661
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,780
Radishes!

662
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,150
There.

663
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,100
This all looks delicious.

664
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,790
Now this is Kyoto cuisine.

665
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,440
I was wondering what was taking him so long to return,

666
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,800
but it turns out he was off observing various eateries in Kyoto.

667
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,740
You're still the better cook, Mrs. Kurata.

668
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,440
I appreciate the flattery,

669
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,200
but that's a lie, is it not?

670
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,960
How could you tell?

671
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,740
His expression is always a dead give away.

672
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,520
He never looks like that when he's eating my cooking.

673
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,990
T-That's not true!

674
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:44,600
Yoshie's got a real eye for people, you ain't tricking her.

675
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,880
Aw, you like my cooking that much, eh?

676
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,830
I hate the man doing the cooking though.

677
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,220
I'm not hearing it.

678
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,410
- Welcome.
- Welcome in.

679
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,000
It must be freezing out there.

680
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,620
Welcome in.

681
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,340
Long time no see.

682
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,680
This is delicious.

683
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,980
It's great stuff, Pops.

684
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,800
Mother.
[Iwai Detective Agency, Tsukumoyacho 99th Street]

685
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,640
I am currently residing in a town

686
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,520
called Tsukumoyacho.

687
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,930
Ms. Kanoko.

688
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,110
What's your verdict on my story?

689
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,990
[To be continued]

690
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,290
I do not intend on meeting my daughter face-to-face.
[Visiting without telling her daughter?]

691
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,660
I only wish to see her doing well.

692
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,830
- Sir.
- Ouch!

693
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,390
There! Someone catch that boy!

694
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,550
I won't allow you through.

695
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,740
Will you truly leave without actually meeting your daughter?
[Will having faith in the truth...]

696
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,630
I'm terrified.
[Will having faith in the truth...]

697
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,440
The Ms. Kanoko I know will listen to your story.
[tie this mother and daughter back together?]

698
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,200
You cheated, didn't you?

699
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,540
You won ten times in a row.

700
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,940
Nonsense.

701
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,470
My daughter is in his care.

702
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,610
