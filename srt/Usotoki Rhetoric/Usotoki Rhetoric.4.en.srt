We've got to call for help.

3
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,420
Right!

4
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,010
What's the matter?

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,460
I think I saw someone up there...

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,450
Never mind.

[One month afterwards]

8
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,130
Will our lunch on the rails be beef? Fish?

9
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,920
Or maybe a luxurious boxed lunch?

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,820
Someone's excited.

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,060
But of course.

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,200
We've never traveled by train before.

[Tsukumoyacho - First Year of the Showa Era (1926)]

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,310
Clients?

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,790
How I wish we had a client.

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,090
We're not traveling for a job?

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,850
No, I'm running from an obligation.

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,850
Money looks tight this month,

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,710
and I doubt I can make rent.

20
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,200
- You're running off into the night?
- More like morning.

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,500
Sir, you mustn't!

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,750
But I'm absolutely broke.

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,110
Don't sound so proud about that.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,210
- Say, Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes?

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,150
That man with the baggage there.

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,180
He just grabbed a briefcase atop a bench,

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,750
and wrapped it with the cloth he's holding, did he not?

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,030
Sorry sir, I wasn't looking.

29
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,490
But what if he did?

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,020
It's odd, that's what.

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,900
Mr. Iwai is absolutely hopeless when it comes to money,

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,380
but he's an excellent detective,

33
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,000
who catches the finer details.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,280
The briefcase had a large handle,

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,500
yet he chose to carry it in a cloth instead.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,280
Not the most efficient way to carry your bags, I'd say.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,220
Does that mean he took someone else's briefcase,

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,780
and is trying to take off with it?

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,070
Let's find out.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,470
Meanwhile I, the detective's assistant,

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,150
can detect lies.

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,050
Excuse me, sir.

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,930
I think you may have picked up the wrong bag.

44
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,010
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,810
These are my belongings.

46
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,230
Whenever someone lies,

47
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,240
I hear a grating, metallic sound mixed with their tone of voice.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,170
Is that so? My apologies, good sir.

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,110
I simply saw you take that briefcase off the bench there,

50
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,760
and wrap it up like it was your own.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,080
So sorry I assumed you were a common thief.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,170
A thief? Ridiculous.

53
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,880
You're jumping to conclusions.

54
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,640
Hey, where's my briefcase?

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,770
Mr. Iwai!

56
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:14,290
Your excuses will fall on deaf ears, especially with the way you've wrapped that bag.

57
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,800
M-Mr. Iwai!

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,910
Ow, ouch...

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,060
What an incompetent thief.

Is that you, Miyabi? Great to see the big sister back in town.

63
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,530
And I see you're still as flimsy as I last saw you.

64
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,760
Sister? I never knew you had siblings.

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,930
Who might this be?

66
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,430
This is my assistant.

67
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,840
A-Assistant? You, the dirt poor detective, have an assistant?

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,340

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,790
Well, I help clean the Inari shrine,

73
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,360

- Miyabi Hanasaki. It's a pleasure.

But why him?

77
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,520
Hanasaki... Does that make you Mr. Hanasaki's sister?

78
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,900
Bingo.

This is Miyabi Hanasaki, the elder sister of Mr. Kaoru Hanasaki.

80

Ms. Miyabi is a journalist,

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,230

83
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,350

What exactly does your journal cover, Ms. Miyabi?

92
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,750
She writes about ghosts and oddities in the "Occult Investigator".

93
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,780
It's essentially a book of ghost stories.

I hear you've come to look into Ine's death, yes?

125
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,150
Truth be told, she was a distant relative of mine.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,180
Ine's parents passed on when she was young,

127
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,720
leaving her and her elder brother to fend for themselves.

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,810
However, two years ago they came seeking my help,

129
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:56,020
as their father had left behind absurd debts to settle.

130
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,170
Speaking of, this is Ine's elder brother.

131
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,100
He does easy work around town,

132
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,010
as his body cannot handle much more.

133
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,560
As for Ine, I had introduced her to become a housemaid.

134

See there?

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,200
Take this road all the way down,

and you'll reach the Ayao's place.

Otherwise known as the Doll House.

138
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,250
The "Doll House"?

139
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,860
It's called that, because of an odd ritual the Ayao's practiced.

140
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,930
To pray for the good health of their weak, only daughter,

141
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,590
the Ayao's "raised" dolls.

142
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,700
- They raised...
- Dolls?

143
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,900
Yes.

144
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,690
They had a doll made for every stage of their daughter's life,

145
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,080
from baby dolls, to even life-sized dolls.

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,420
I hear they dress the doll every day,

147
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,720
and prepare it the same meals as their daughter, too.

148
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,290
Food, for a doll?

149
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,900
I see now why it's called the Doll House.

150
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,650
But that's not all.

151
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,330
Because the Ayao's died at sea,

152
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,980
the entire manor now belongs to their only daughter.

153
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,140
Her name is Shinako Ayao, sole survivor of the Ayao family.

154
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,550
They say she looks like a doll herself.

155
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,810
This Shinako also has an odd rumor about her.

156
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,700
Some say the Ayao's called no doctor or midwife for her birth.

157
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,380
She was just born, and that was that.

158
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,870
Others saw her break her leg,

159
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,570
and walk perfectly fine the next day.

160
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,330
Rumor also says the dolls have eaten their food,

161
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,940
or that voices can be heard from the doll's room.

162
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,680
Is she a doll? Or was she born of dolls?

163
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,340
Hence, the Doll House.

164
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,020
Even without the whole incident where her housemaid had died,

165
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,730
this manor is prime material for a ghost story!

166
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,780
Given the manner of this abode and its sole resident,

167
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,170
the housemaids do not last long.

168
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,970
Both are quite unsettling, after all.

169
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,000
It's like she can read our minds. Unsettling, I'd say.

170
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,370
But thanks to that, a spot was quick to open here,

171
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,450
allowing Ine the opportunity to work.

172
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,940
And all was well...

173
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,940
until a particular incident one month ago, in the early morn.

174
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,430

175
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,750
- Uncle!
- Yes, yes, I'm coming.

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,100
Come again?

181
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,740
According to Ine's testimony,

182
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,020
this all began because she saw a large rat appear in the kitchen.

183
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,220
[Strong Rat Poison]

184
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,970
Ine believed this rat was the one eating the doll's meal,

185
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,420
so she laced the doll's serving with a rat poison. Except...

186
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,650
She had found a person lying dead instead.

187
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,940
In a panic, Ine ran out the manor,

188
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,850
and all the way to my place.

189
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,330
Did a human accidentally eat the laced portion?

190
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,120
That was also my first thought,

191
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,970
so I called a local officer to accompany us to the manor.

192
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,140
However, upon our arrival,

193
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,430
the one lying dead by Shinako's side...

194
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,240
was none other than a doll itself.

195
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,980
The one who had died, was a doll.

196
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,420
Did Ine mistake the doll for a real person?

197
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,980
It seems entirely possible to me.

198
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,080
I believe she did.

199
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,640
After all,

200
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,750
Shinako and the housemaids were without harm.

201
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,350
There was no dead body to speak of.

202
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,400
Yet it was while I was confirming this fact,

203
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,460
that Ine herself died.

204
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,920
She disappeared on us

205
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,960
the moment I took my eyes off her.

206
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,550
Next we knew, her body was found by the rocks down there.

207
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,060
When we notified Ine's elder brother of her death...

208
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,160
Really, it was too pitiful a sight.

209
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,250
Ine frequented her brother's place to care for him, after all.

210
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,980
What a coincidence. That's Kubo, the youth who discovered Ine's body.

211
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,400
Kubo!

212
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,990
My father and I were fishing for cherry salmon along the other bank,

213
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,030
when we heard what sounded like a woman screaming.

214
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,370
We went to investigate, only to see a woman bleeding out,

215
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,980
alongside an expensive looking doll.

216
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,620
Oh gods.

217
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,900
- We've got to call for help.
- Right!

218
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,850
That's when I swear I saw a person up there.

219
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,680
She wore a long, draping kimono, like the doll we found.

220
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,840
Another doll?

221
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,160
How do you get up there?

222
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,230
Because there's no path,

223
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,830
the only way up is to navigate through tall grass and trees.

224
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,300
Then how did this person get up there?

225
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,950
It would most certainly be impossible for a girl wearing a draping kimono.

226
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,430
The only individual who matches that description around these parts is Shinako.

227
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,470
But at the time, she was investigating the body with Mr. Terayama and I,

228
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,020
back at the manor.

229
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,190
As such, this person was chalked up to my imagination.

230
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,400
We do not know where this doll she was with came from either.

231
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,380
We asked Ine's brother about the doll as well,

232
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,460
but he said he'd never seen the thing.

233
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,130
According to Officer Terayama,

234
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:04,130
Ine committed suicide, most likely due to the guilt of killing someone.

235
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,740
But gossips around town say Ine was cursed by the doll.

236
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,910
Cursed to death, even.

237
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,170
Did something catch your eye, Mr. Iwai?

238
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,750
If there's no trail up there,

239
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,070
it must mean that forest had nothing tasty worth foraging for.

240
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,450
Doesn't that make you hungry?

241
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,610
The housemaid mistook a doll for a human's body, and committed suicide.

242
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,290
Yet despite the logical conclusion to the case,

243
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,650
rumors always call upon more rumors.

244
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,880
This was how the curse of the Doll House

245
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,630
made its way to the "Occult Investigator".

246
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,500
We have arrived.

247
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,680
What a large manor.

248
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,700
I can see why rumors spread.

249
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,070
This place has the makings for a story!

250
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,540
Now then, this is where we part.

251
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,170
I've told you all there is to tell from my side of it.

252
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,190
Thank you for guiding us.

253
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,770
The Doll House, a manor where dolls are nurtured for.

254
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:42,140
Are dolls truly able to consume their own meals,

255
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,250
and experience death within this manor?

256
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,190
Welcome, esteemed guests.

257
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,450
Please, follow me.

258
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,280
Have you been of service to this manor for long?

259
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,010
Not at all. I have barely worked here a year.

260
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,920
Mr. Shibata was right.

261
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,960
The lady will be with you shortly.

262
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,680
Are any of you hungry? Because I sure am.

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,340
This is a pretty normal parlor, isn't it?

264
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,480
I honestly thought the place would be buried in dolls.

265
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,400
Now that you mention it,

266
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,590
I'm surprised you got this interview.

267
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:59,080
I'd honestly assume the lady here would want nothing to do with a mystery murder.

268
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,580
Truth be told, the Ayao family lawyer's father

269
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,910
is a dear friend of my grandfather, so...

270
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,450
- I see.
- Rich connections.

271
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,340
Putting that aside.

272
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,120
Although my subject matter is the occult,

273
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,350
I am completely against conflating groundless rumors at the cost of an individual.

274
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,510
If I get solid proof that this is only a rumor or misunderstanding,

275
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,480
then that is what I'll write about.

276
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,040
I only secured this interview, on the condition that I write no lie.

277
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,160
Ms. Shinako...

278
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,700
My name is Shinako Ayao.

279
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,510
It's nice to meet you all.

280
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,050
The pleasure is ours.

281
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,260
Ms. Shinako?

282
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,830
I messed up.

283
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,240
I forgot to say something before coming in.

284
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,610
I mean, "before allowing myself in".

285
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,120
It's alright.

286
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,840
How absolutely precious!

287
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,280
It seems the rumor about Ms. Shinako being a doll,

288
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,490
was only in terms of outer appearance.

289
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,460
I hear you rarely leave the manor?

290
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,730
Yes. Because I have a weak constitution,

291
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,290
I've been told to stay home since I was young.

292
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm usually not allowed to see outsiders,

293
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,380
and I have no friends either.

294
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,020
Ever since my mother and father passed,

295
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,140
only Shinako resides in this manor.

296
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,660
Is that so?

297
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,170
Yes.

298
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,410
And the housemaids, of course.

299
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,460
I see.

300
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,970
So Ms. Shinako lives in this large manor

301
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,370
up in the mountains

302
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,670
with no company to call her own.

303
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,930
Please don't conflate anything.

304
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,650
Don't say a doll died,

305
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,520
or that Ms. Ine was cursed to death by a doll.

306
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,630
I beg you, please do not ridicule these things in your journal.

307
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,160
- Pardon?
- With the way Ms. Ine died,

308
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,240
many journalists wished to hear of the case.

309
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,560
Although I had turned them all down,

310
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,400
I caught a journalist sneaking into the manor,

311
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,780
attempting to grab a photograph of me.

312
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,680
They said a doll had cursed Ms. Ine to death,

313
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,040
that they wanted a scoop of the "creepy doll girl".

314
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,980
She's so creepy.

315
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,920
See ya, Monster!

316
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,270
We're not monsters.

317
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,930
That's truly horrible.

318
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,740
Our family lawyer says they're only curious because of the potential of hidden truths.

319
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,120
His advice was to accept this interview,

320
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,540
and have an article written to satiate the prying eyes.

321
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,420
He guaranteed you wouldn't write a lie, Ms. Hanasaki.

322
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,990
Well...

323
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,600
She used less-than-honest methods to get here.

324
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,440
But I guess she wouldn't.

325
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,110
To tell you the truth, I also came because of your customs,

326
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,580
and to pry into the rumors of the doll who died.

327
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,500
Word of this "doll-like girl" piqued my curiosity, too.

328
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,070
But that's exactly why I agree.

329
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,940
The best way to satiate human curiosity

330
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,440
is to have a proper article written about the truth.

331
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,540
Ms. Shinako, I want to help you.

332
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,200
Could you tell me more about your family and home?

333
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,400
I shall.

334
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,050
Speaking of dolls, I don't see a single one around here...

335
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,280
The dolls reside in a dwelling, separate from the main house.

336
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,010
I see, so that is where the dolls are.

337
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,980
I'd love to grab a shot.

338
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,280
Perhaps we could talk in there?

339
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,700
That dwelling is also Shinako's room.

340
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,350
No one else is allowed in, except the housemaid bringing in a meal.

341
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,420
Weren't Mr. Shibata and Mr. Terayama allowed in

342
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,670
when that doll-person died?

343
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,130
Yes, they were.

344
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,980
Shinako said no, but they insisted.

345
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,570
That's alright then.

346
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,690
Rules are meant to be respected, after all.

347
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,220
But could we take a glance inside when dinner is brought in?

348
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,330
Of course.

349
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,490
Great! Until then, tell me more about life here.

350
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,240
I'd love to.

351
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,100
- First, do you live with the dolls in that dwelling?
- Yes.

352
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,030
- Mr. Iwai?
- Hm?

353
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,180
Ms. Shinako has totally opened her heart to Ms. Miyabi.

354
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,840
Indeed, and that's what makes Miyabi so terrifying.

355
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,200
But I have my meals in the main manor.

356
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,090
The housemaid comes to inform me when it is time to eat.

357
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,000
She's great at buttering people up.

358
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,650
Don't put it like that.

359
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,550
Ms. Miyabi said she wanted to help, and that was no lie.

360
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,310
Do the dolls eat then as well?

361
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,350
Yes. The housemaid brings their tray.

362
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,830
You seem enthusiastic about this.

363
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,270
I am.

364
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,780
After all,

365
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,830
Ms. Shinako may be able to clear up the rumors,

366
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,850
thanks to this interview.

367
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,750
I see. So the meals were always prepared for two.

368
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,150
Where do you bathe?

369
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,440
I freshen up in the main house as well.

370
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,860
It's great that you're excited,

371
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,080
but there's not really much for us to do.

372
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,810
We're only here to carry bags. I'm almost bored.

373
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,150
Ms. Shinako may not have to be alone anymore...

374
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,730
Just like me.

375
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,130
So she only comes to call for meals, and a bath?

376
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,480
Yes. The dwelling there is Shinako's room,

377
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,130
- while the main house is for...
- Ms. Kanoko.

378
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,060
You address yourself by saying "I", don't you?

379
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,760
Huh?

380
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,660
Yes, I do.

381
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,440
Say...

382
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,620
Aren't you hungry?

383
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,690
Does this mean only you and your parents could come and go between the two houses?

384
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,420
No. My mother and father never entered the other dwelling.

385
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,620
That was Shinako's room, after all.

386
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,670
Your parents were forbidden from entering as well?

387
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,620
Yes.

388
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,090
When Shinako was young, grannie and the nurse were around instead.

389
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,830
So your parents couldn't enter,

390
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,260
but a wet nurse and sitter were?

391
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,870
Precisely.

392
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,210
You weren't sad to be apart from your parents?

393
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,760
They said this was for Shinako's sake. So Shinako would stay healthy.

394
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,770
Excuse me for being blunt, but are you perhaps a twin -

395
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,030
Pardon the interruption.

396
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,070
Lady Shinako, it is time for dinner.

397
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,620
Shall I carry the meal to your room?

398
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,650
The guests wish to see the room.

399
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,520
I shall take it myself.

400
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,990
Understood.

401
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,110
Sir, you go first.

402
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,540
H-Hold on!

403
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,990
What a marvel...

404
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,860
This is what is called the doll's room.

405
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,820
Father commissioned these dolls to match Shinako's growth,

406
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,700
as well as a friend

407
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,420
for each and every other Shinako.

408
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,380
He gave dolls to other dolls?

409
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
- The meal.
- Right.

410
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,660
All we do is replace lunch with a fresh dinner, and so on.

411
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,310
They're so impressive, it seems like they'd move at any moment.

412
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,640
This doll has a scuff on her face...

413
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,250
She got scratched

414
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,430
against the tray Ms. Ine brought in with the poison.

415
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,960
So this is the doll that was found on the floor.

416
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,420
Say, Ms. Shinako.

417
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,970
Could I take a photo of this doll knocked on the floor?

418
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,530
- What?
- Huh?

419
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,310
This feels all too real...

420
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,420
I can see how Ms. Ine would make the mistake she made.

421
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,810
Even from photograph, it's hard to tell whether this is a doll or human.

422
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,330
Alright, place her back, you two.

423
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,300
- What?
- Huh?

424
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,640
Come on now, hurry.

425
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,610
Thank you for that, Ms. Shinako.

426
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,190
Say, I wanted to ask about the doll Ms. Ine was found with.

427
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,900
Was it not a doll from this room?

428
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,910
I'm sure the police have asked you a similar question already.

429
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,030
The official report says the origins of the doll are unknown, but...

430
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,080
That doll...

431
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,230
It disappeared from this room one day out of the blue.

432
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,860
Does that mean it was stolen?

433
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,110
No... Was it Ms. Ine?

434
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,470
I believe so.

435
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,900
But if I confess this, Ms. Ine will become a thief.

436
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,640
"Become a thief"?

437
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,250
So you feigned ignorance, in order to protect Ms. Ine's name.

438
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,550
Will you write about this in your journal too?

439
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,560
If I don't, the mystery will be...

440
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,160
S-Sir, don't touch that without permission.

441
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,470
Soma! What are you doing?

442
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,710
No touching.

443
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,970
- I'm just so bored.
- Still, no touching.

444
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,520
Please, just stay put.

445
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,580
In any case,

446
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,000
I wonder where this tradition itself hails from?

447
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,530
Your mother's home, perhaps?

448
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,550
I do not know.

449
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,240
Mother and father passed

450
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,180
before revealing anything.

451
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,040
Without knowing those details,

452
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,620
it'll be hard to convince people this is more than just a mysterious tradition...

453
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,400
Even if people call this custom creepy or unsettling,

454
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,270
it is something Mother and Father left behind for Shinako.

455
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,740
Shinako will protect it.

456
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,460
Unsettling, I'd say.

457
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,980
Even if people call her unsettling?

458
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,450
Ms. Shinako has such an iron will...

459
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,990
Soma!

460
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,540
Actually...

461
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,860
That was me.

462
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,940
I've grown quite hungry as well.

463
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,910
Let us return to the main house, and have a meal.

464
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,280
Great, let's eat.

465
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,970
Yes, let's.

466
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,520
I never would have guessed that was you, Kanoko.

467
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,700
Thanks for dinner.

468
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,430
Mr. Iwai!

469
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,660
Sorry about him...

470
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,500
I see our meal is the same as the doll's.

471
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,010
Oh? My tray is missing chopsticks.

472
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,730
It is.

473
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,470
I shall go get them from the housemaid.

474
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,590
No, allow me. You are a guest.

475
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,860
Please, let me do this much.

476
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,420
Woah...

477
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,410
You're treating us to a meal, after all.

478
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,320
I'll be back.

479
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,470
Dinner, dinner.

480
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,460
Ms. Shinako?

481
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,190
We are delivered firewood once a month,

482
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,980
and produce and fish once every two days.

483
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,740
I see.

484
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,330
Thank you, Kanoko.

485
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,650
- Here you are.
- Sorry about that.

486
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,390
It was no trouble.

487
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,740
A croquette?

488
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,050
It looks delicious!

489
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:56,920
Ms. Shinako, if I may ask, are you perhaps... a twin?

490
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,870
You thought so too?

491
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,240
I had that hunch as well.

492
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,080
No, I am not a twin.

493
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,270
She's not lying.

494
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,360
- I must have been imagining things.
- Seconds!

495
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,480
Let us give this a try as well.

496
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,900
- Yes. Thank you again for dinner.
- Of course.

497
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,720
- Yum!
- Even Mr. Iwai, who usually picks up on oddities,

498
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,900
isn't raising objections.

499
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,600
Ms. Shinako was never lying.

500
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,880
I'll wrap this up as a heartwarming story

501
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,950
between parent and child for the journal.

502
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,940
Once I've written about your story, the rumors should die down as well.

503
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,670
Thank you very much.

504
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,210
With a smile like that, there's nothing creepy about you at all.

505
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,410
Exactly.

506
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,280
Ms. Shinako.

507
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,800
How about you step outside your manor every once in a while?

508
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,590
I also left my home, in a moment of rare boldness.

509
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,960
I'm sure once people actually get to meet you,

510
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,300
they'll understand your circumstances.

511
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,020
Indeed.

512
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,040
I hope Ms. Shinako can find someone she can trust,

513
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,770
like how I ran into Mr. Iwai.

514
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,210
Who decided to call this a "doll killing" anyway?

515
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,010
No one has been murdered.

516
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,570
Exactly. No one has died here,

517
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,960
and Ms. Ine's death was a suicide.

518
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,450
Are you alright?

519
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,880
Yes, sorry about that.

520
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,290
Say, could I take more pictures of the doll room when you bring in breakfast tomorrow?

521
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,610
I think a brighter lighting would be better.

522
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,990
Of course.

523
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,000
Why?

524
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,330
Just now, Ms. Shinako...

525
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,560
Exactly.

526
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,690
Told a lie.

527
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,330
- But does that mean...
- No one has died here.

528
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,790
The one lying dead wasn't a doll,

529
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,900
but it was a real human being?

530
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,320
And Ms. Ine's death was a suicide.

531
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,170
Was Ms. Ine's death not a suicide?

532
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,960
I heard the lie,

533
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,230
but I wasn't able to signal it to Mr. Iwai.

534
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,340
Kanoko.

535
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,630
You should go take a bath with Miyabi.

536
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,990
I will.

537
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,900
You'll feel relaxed with the crickets chirping.

538
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,980
Right.

539
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,160
The night breeze feels good, doesn't it?

540
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,820
Yes.

541
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,960
We're quite fortunate, aren't we?

542
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,730
We got rent, multiple meals, and a nice bath out of this trip.

543
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,730
What do I do?

544
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,250
I need to tell Mr. Iwai the truth.

545
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,460
I need to, but...

546
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,850
Ms. Kanoko.

547
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,840
I won't force you to speak up.

548
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,000
But you're acting quite obvious.

549
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,940
I'm no match.

550
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,620
Wow, that looks delicious!

551
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,420
You work so hard, ma'am.

552
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,260
Such beautiful skin, too!

553
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,810
My, thank you.

554
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,150
Would you like a taste?

555
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,690
May I really?

556
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,360
You've only been here a year, yes?

557
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,460
"No one has died",

558
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,830
and "Ms. Ine's death was a suicide", were both lies.

559
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,000
But the thing about her not being a twin...

560
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,820
Was the truth.

561
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,660
I see.

562
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,260
If she lied,

563
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,980
does that mean Ms. Shinako is hiding something?

564
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,260
I assume that's the case, yes.

565
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,030
Do you think Ms. Shinako's lie...

566
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,840
is a bad lie?

567
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,770
What's a "bad" lie?

568
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,670
A lie told to hide something heinous,

569
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,600
or a lie that hurts people.

570
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,300
Does that mean "good" lies exist, too?

571
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,780
Yes.

572
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,240
Good lies are white lies told for the sake of another.

573
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:32,440
If Ms. Shinako's lie is a bad one...

574
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,290
We are to uncover the truth, aren't we?

575
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,730
But you'd rather not.

576
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,790
That's why you weren't able to send me a signal during dinner.

577
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,340
If Ms. Shinako is keeping this a secret,

578
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,480
it would mean uncovering the truth

579
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,100
would put her in a tough spot, yes?

580
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,870
I want to be an ally to Ms. Shinako.

581
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,600
She is struggling against these rumors, alone.

582
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,730
Even if people call this custom creepy or unsettling,

583
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,010
it is something Mother and Father left behind for Shinako.

584
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,350
Shinako will protect it.

585
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,850
But if her lie

586
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,620
is hurting someone else...

587
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:45,190
What am I to do?

588
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:50,480
Whatever you want.

589
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,850
Were you listening to a word I said?

590
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,460
I was, and that's my answer.

591
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,550
You say there are "good" and "bad" lies.

592
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,460
But Ms. Shinako lied to the police, to cover up Ms. Ine's theft.

593
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,300
If I confess this, Ms. Ine will become a thief.

594
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,750
This lie sounds like a good one,

595
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,330
because she's standing up for Ms. Ine.

596
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:20,200
But let's say Ms. Ine had stolen from other homes.

597
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,190
Then it gets complicated.

598
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,600
Whether something can be deemed a "good" or "bad" lie

599
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,640
will always depend on circumstance and perspective.

600
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,430
All you can really do,

601
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,710
is act based on what you believe is right.

602
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:43,120
Based on what I believe...

603
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,740
I mean,

604
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:52,030
you would never use your powers to hurt someone, right?

605
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:57,430
Which is why I think you should do whatever you want.

606
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,820
Maybe we don't know our stance on Ms. Shinako's lie yet.

607
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,100
So let's look into it a bit more, alright?

608
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,540
Right.

609
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,390
On that note, you really should take advantage of the bath.

610
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,250
What about you, sir?

611
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,630
I have to finish eating this persimmon!

612
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,580
Soma. Good morning.

613
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,940
Good morning, Miyabi.

614
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,730
Are you off to take photos of the doll room?

615
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,280
Yes.

616
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,960
Say, Soma.

617
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,180
What do you think of this custom of theirs?

618
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,820
The whole thing about raising dolls?

619
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,430
I overslept.

620
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,400
Her parents say it was for the sake of her health,

621
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,070
but to me, it feels more like they're memorializing a dead child.

622
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,090
I ran into the housemaid after the bath yesterday.

623
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,770
According to her, the housemaids don't stay long

624
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,470
not because they get creeped out,

625
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,610
but because they get swapped out in short intervals.

626
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,040
They also never hire locals.

627
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,200
In truth, the villagers here don't know these customs well.

628
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,170
In other words, you think the reason why this custom has seemingly no reason nor origin,

629
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,650
is because the Ayao couple was keeping it a secret on purpose.

630
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,450
I believe the Ayao's had a secret they desperately wanted to keep here.

631
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,560
The secret being, that Ms. Shinako is a twin.

632
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,750
Ms. Shinako denied the claim,

633
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,400
but she must be lying.

634
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,570
"Twins are harbingers of disaster."

635
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,270
You must've heard the superstition before.

636
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,240
It's absolutely ridiculous, that's what it is.

637
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,480
Yes, but some regions still believe in such ridiculous tales.

638
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,770
What?

639
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,100
Nothing.

640
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,930
I see you were only playing nice with Ms. Shinako.

641
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,540
Don't call it that.

642
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,000
Mind you, I ride a fine balance between "kindness" and "caution".

643
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,730
How absolutely reassuring.

644
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,900
In any case, I think -

645
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,650
Miyabi.

646
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,160
Look.

647
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,190
At what?

648
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,040
Mr. Iwai, Ms. Miyabi.

649
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,270
Good morning.

650
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,980
Kanoko...

651
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,820
What are you looking at?

652
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,210
Can you see that in there?

653
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,820
Is that...

654
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,190
Blood?

655
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,690
What?

656
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,120
Ms. Shinako? Ms. Shinako!

657
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,550
Are you there?

658
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,600
It's no use, she's not responding.

659
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,920
I'll go ask the housemaid for a key.

660
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,440
Miyabi, let's find a way in.

661
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,500
I doubt the housemaid has a key.

662
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,900
- What?
- I agree with you.

663
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,080
I think this house holds a secret,

664
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,980
and it's most likely in here.

665
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,950
A mere housemaid would never have access to a place like that.

666
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,210
Take yesterday for example.

667
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,120
The housemaid has to call for Ms. Shinako to deliver dinner,

668
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,450
because she has the key.

669
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,780
Alright, I get that.

670
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,430
So then go,

671
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,800
go get Kanoko!

672
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,160
She sympathizes with Ms. Shinako.

673
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,820
If we assume the worst happened to Ms. Shinako inside,

674
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,970
I'd feel bad making her see it.

675
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,050
- And I'm fine?
- We can get in through here.

676
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,390
Hey!

677
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,160
I've got another favor to ask you, Miyabi.

678
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,650
Please pay for the glass.

679
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,620
Ms. Shinako? This is Hanasaki.

680
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,470
I'll be coming in.

681
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,080
Ms. Shinako?

682
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,930
Ms. Shinako!

683
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,660
Ms. Shinako -

684
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,020
This is... a doll.

685
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,950
But this is blood.

686
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,160
The kimono here is gone.

687
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,790
What?

688
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,220
Ms. Shinako...

689
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,790
Why have you entered Shinako's room?

690
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,090
I said you mustn't enter aside from bringing in meals.

691
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,260
Ms. Shinako?

692
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,680
Is that really you?

693
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,110
[To be continued]

694
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,660
Call the police, now.
[The doll's curse has yet to end]

695
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,020
The police?
[The doll's curse has yet to end]

696
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,100
We're allowing people in here?

697
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,400
- You done it!
- Yes.

698
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,650
- Let's head up there.
- What?

699
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,890
- Hand it over.
- Why?

700
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,030
Can we save it for later?

701
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,830
She'll become a doll.
[The truth hidden within this eerie mansion...]

702
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,770
Ms. Shinako wasn't lying.
[and this series of doll killings comes to light!]

703
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,180
She was never the only "Shinako".

704
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,720
Why have you entered Shinako's room?

705
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,850
I said you mustn't enter aside from bringing in meals.

706
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,310
That answer was another lie.

707
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,510
- A lie?
- Exactly.

708
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,000
She didn't eat with us.

709
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,860
A lie, how?

710
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,220
I have my suspicions, so I'll go search there.

711
