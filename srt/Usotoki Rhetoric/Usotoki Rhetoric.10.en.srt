00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,300
Sorry, I was simply mystified.

186
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,490
Mystified?

187
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,200
See, my daughter...

188
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,430
Never mind.

189
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,940
At least it seems like they get along well with each other.

190
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:50,200
Why is this "Mr. Iwai" able to get along so well with Kanoko?

191
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,010
I work at Suou's Sandals, doing odd jobs around shops.

192
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,740
What's your name, kid?

193
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,950
Kasuke.

194
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,590
- What was that?
- Kasuke.

195
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,980
Tell me, Kasuke. Why'd you trick me?

196
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,020
The Suou kid's book got torn.

197
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,220
So I went to go buy a new one, before Mr. Suou found out.

198
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,260
There you go.
[Children's Encyclopedia of Bugs]

199
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,490
How much?

200
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,380
That book costs 80 sen.

201
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,940
Dear, come over here.

202
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,620
Sorry, I'll be right back with you, son.

203
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,880
Yes?

204
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,740
I was short on money.
[Children's Encyclopedia of Bugs]

205
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,880
Excuse me, could I get the book written on this note here?

206
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,750
I took on this errand but I can't read, or write for that matter.

207
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,810
I assumed you had mistaken me for a clerk.

208
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,730
Sorry, were you a customer?

209
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,160
So...

210
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,940
Nope, I work here.

211
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,120
We just sold the copy we had on display.

212
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,510
I'll grab another from the back.

213
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,960
Thanks a bunch.

214
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,020
- Could I get the payment first?
- Right.

215
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,550
Here's 30 sen.

216
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,710
Perfect.

217
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,330
I'll be back with you shortly.

218
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,760
Just give me a minute.

219
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,670
Thanks for waiting...
[Sugaya Bookstore]

220
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,210
Son?

221
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,730
H-Hey! Thief!

222
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,540
First things first, you gotta apologize for tearing the book.

223
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,420
It wasn't me.

224
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,030
A stray dog got to it.

225
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,360
Then just say so.

226
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,140
'Cause no one will believe me.

227
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,700
And why's that?

228
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,200
My dead dad was caught as a robber.

229
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,570
The first store I worked at always blamed me for their problems.

230
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,830
No one ever believes me even when I'm telling the truth.

231
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,810
So I gotta lie my way out of it.

232
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,180
What an angsty lad.

233
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,800
So, how much are you short?

234
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,380
- Huh?
- I can't cover the whole bill, but I can pitch in a bit.

235
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,500
You can't be serious.

236
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,720
What if I was lying just now?

237
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,740
You weren't lying.

238
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,630
It feels great to hear that, even though I was.

239
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,480
You weren't.

240
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,240
Listen here, Kasuke.

241
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,870
I often find myself in a similar situation.

242
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,380
But the reason I still manage to scrape by

243
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,550
is because there are people who are willing to help, and forgive.

244
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,100
There are people who are willing to believe.

245
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,200
Without them, I don't know where I'd be now.

246
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,920
It's when I think back on these kind folk,

247
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,060
that I realize I can't just wallow, you know?

248
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,730
So just think of it as your lucky day, and take my change.

249
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,780
Let it overwrite the bad vibes.

250
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,440
I don't need your pity.

251
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,390
You're making me look like a brat.

252
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,860
That's because you are.

253
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,910
Mr. Suou...

254
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,010
He's a nice guy.

255
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,050
Do you think he'll believe me if I explain myself?

256
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,060
I wouldn't know.

257
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,830
I'm not this "Mr. Suou", after all.

258
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,770
Whatever.

259
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,980
Even if he doesn't believe me, I'll tell him everything.

260
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,750
I just want to try.

261
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,720
Sounds good.

262
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,130
Will you truly leave without actually meeting your daughter?

263
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,740
Yes.

264
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,240
I only want to see how she is doing.

265
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,250
Are you really this girl's mother?

266
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,230
Pardon?

267
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,480
Your story reminds me of a common fraud.

268
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,130
A mother comes to "visit", only to rob an empty house clean of all its valuables.

269
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,930
I am no thief.

270
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,360
They convince strangers that they don't wish to see their child, only to -

271
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,450
That is not the case.

272
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,220
But then this is strange.

273
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,630
Strange?

274
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,270
You have her address, but didn't send word of your visit,

275
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,290
and now you're trying to leave without even a "hello".

276
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,170
That doesn't sound like you cherish your daughter at all.

277
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,580
I'm terrified.

278
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,500
Of meeting your daughter?

279
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,560
But she is your treasure, is she not?

280
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,200
She is, and I cherish her deeply.

281
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,480
But I am afraid my words will only hurt her.

282
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,900
In that case, simply don't say anything that will.

283
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,540
Although, if your daughter was somehow able to detect lies,

284
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,430
I can understand why you would worry.

285
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,870
Pardon?

286
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,500
"What if there was a lie mixed within my words?"

287
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,600
"What if she had to hear it?"

288
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Yes, I can see why you would be fearful.

289
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,540
- Sir?
- Like parent, like child.

290
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,100
It seems your experiences resonated with Kasuke, Mr. Riichi.

291
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,450
Don't give me all the credit.

292
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,030
It helped that you believed in his story too, miss.

293
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,850
That kid had lost his faith in people,

294
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,200
because people lost faith in him.

295
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,740
My claim that he "wasn't lying", isn't exactly the same as believing in others.

296
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,180
Drat.

297
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,110
I forgot to buy the book.

298
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,560
Still, I understand the importance of belief and believing.

299
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,680
Because having that sort of trust

300
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,560
makes a person feel stronger at heart.

301
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,380
Excuse me, are you...

302
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,370
Even your expressions and mannerisms are similar.

303
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,570
Especially the way you both worry yourselves into a twist,

304
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,190
and the way your stomachs frequently rumble as well.

305
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,390
You are Ms. Kanoko's mother, no?

306
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,940
- Huh?
- We've arrived.

307
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,020
Welcome to my office.

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,740
"Iwai Detective Agency"...

309
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,670
Mr. Soma Iwai?

310
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,000
As for why "Mr. Iwai" is able to get along with Kanoko...

311
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,290
It's because I'd rather have someone expose my lies,

312
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,190
than deal with someone who doesn't believe in me, when I speak the truth.

313
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,990
After all, the fact that she's able to perceive lies,

314
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,730
also means she's able to see the truth.

315
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,560
She's able to see the truth?

316
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,480
I've never thought of it that way before.

317
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,110
All my life, I've only focused on how not to hurt her feelings.

318
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,990
I'd speak carefully, to not lie.

319
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,440
But I was afraid that effort too, would sound like a falsehood.

320
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,500
It was a dilemma I could never find a solution for.

321
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,100
Don't overthink it, and complicate things further.

322
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,740
Tell her everything that's on your mind.

323
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,160
Will that child forgive me?

324
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,360
After all these years?

325
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,620
I don't know. I'm not Ms. Kanoko, after all.

326
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,600
Nevertheless...

327
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,310
The Ms. Kanoko I know

328
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,600
will listen to your story.

329
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,540
You won't insist on leaving without seeing her now, will you?

330
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,880
I forgot to lock up again.

331
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,740
Ms. Kanoko will nag at me again.

332
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,040
Come on in.

333
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,700
Kanoko gets mad?

334
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,480
Quite often.

335
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,990
Welcome.

336
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,460
Please, have a seat.

337
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,780
She reprimands me when I try to sneak a bite of food.

338
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,460
She wasn't forgiving when I suggested we take a lost cat as hostage, too.

339
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,150
Ms. Kanoko also laughs and eats plenty.

340
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,820
She's actually even sung and danced with me before.

341
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,610
She dances?

342
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,020
She does indeed.

343
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,660
Excellent timing.

344
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,400
Kanoko...

345
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Mother?

346
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,520
I'm so glad you look well.

347
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,580
Why have you...

348
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,810
What about Dai?

349
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,600
Your father has come home from work, and is looking after him.

350
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,270
Mother...

351
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,230
I missed you, my dear.

352
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,450
Thank you very much, Mr. Iwai.

353
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you for dinner.

354
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,240
Yes, thank you again.

355
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,740
Come visit again any time now.

356
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:12,250
Mrs. Yoshie. Please continue to take great care of Kanoko.

357
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,170
You won't be returning with them, Soma?

358
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,920
You inconsiderate fool.

359
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,010
I don't want to intrude.

360
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,010
Kanoko looked so happy tonight.

361
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,360
Did Kanoko go home?

362
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,220
Yes, she just did.

363
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,360
- Mom, tell them.
- Hm?

364
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,490
Kanoko's not here!

365
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,700
Right!

366
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,400
Mr. Iwai, Mr. Hanasaki.

367
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,080
They're all such nice folk.

368
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,190
There are plenty of others you haven't met too.

369
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,220
There's Mr. Roppei, Mrs. Lily,

370
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,770
Mr. Kanji... and Ms. Chiyo!

371
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,620
Ms. Chiyo is the daughter of the Fujishima family.

372
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,000
She's an energetic, and fun individual to be around.

373
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,260
Is this person your friend?

374
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,780
Yup.

375
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,030
I see.

376
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,590
Mr. Iwai is...

377
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,370
He's an exceptional person, really.

378
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,640
I know he has that unpaid tab...

379
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,500
But he's truly kind.

380
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,270
I can tell from the way you talk about him.

381
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,800
When you left the village,

382
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,710
I said you were welcome home any time, remember?

383
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,010
Yes.

384
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:56,080
You know you're welcome home anytime, right?

385
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,010
I know. Thank you.

386
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,380
I have always been worried about those words.

387
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,810
If you came home to the village, you would only suffer.

388
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:15,980
And if that were so, perhaps it was best you never returned.

389
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,720
It was an honest thought I had. I couldn't help myself.

390
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,400
But then...

391
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,990
What if my words only sounded like a lie?

392
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,830
I tried penning a letter about this.

393
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,650
But a letter is...

394
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,920
I know.

395
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,000
I finally had it up to here, and found myself in Tsukumoyacho.

396
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,430
Yet until I met Mr. Iwai...

397
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,090
I didn't even have the courage to speak with you.

398
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,030
I'm so sorry.

399
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,240
In my fear of a slight lie...

400
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,370
I failed to tell you everything I truly feel.

401
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,460
I love you, Kanoko.

402
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,350
I love you.

403
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,640
I love you, my dear.

404
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,500
Mother...

405
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,630
Mother...

406
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,950
I'm sorry...

407
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,080
I'm so sorry.

408
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,080
Mother...

409
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,230
What? You ate a Tsukumoyaki?

410
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,200
It was delicious.

411
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,960
I'm glad.

412
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,150
Because sometimes, it's not.

413
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,600
- Really?
- Yup.

414
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,200
Talking about food is making me hungry again.

415
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,850
It's time for bed.

416
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,000
Good night.

417
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,810
A surprise Christmas party?

418
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,960
Something to show our appreciation for Ms. Urabe's hard work around town, I suppose?

419
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,380
Indeed. We shall begin preparing tomorrow

420
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,230
for the party two nights from now.

421
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,720
Mr. Iwai, you will help my husband carry in the tree tomorrow.

422
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,470
He'll be leaving first thing in the morning, so be ready.

423
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,700
Wake up.

424
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,410
- I'm not lifting a finger.
- Mr. Iwai.

425
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,530
Soma. No one is more indebted to Ms. Urabe than you are.

426
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:52,180
You're always preaching to me about sincerity, but look at you now.

427
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,760
How dare you lie to Ms. Kanoko?

428
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,230
Personally, I'd hate to keep anything from her.

429
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,840
Why don't we just spill the beans?

430
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,550
You don't get it, Mr. Iwai.

431
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,950
We're going to surprise her.

432
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,070
Keep complaining, and there will be no more meals for you.

433
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,740
Now Taro, it's off to bed with you.

434
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,170
This spells bad news...

435
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,930
Good morning...

436
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,440
Huh?

437
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,450
Good morning.

438
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,640
Mr. Iwai?

439
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,260
Mr. Iwai doesn't seem to be around.

440
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,490
Is that so?

441
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,870
I had hoped to say farewell, but alas.

442
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,940
My train is coming soon.

443
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,900
Yup.

444
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,150
Give Mr. Iwai and the others my regards, alright?

445
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,460
I will.

446
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,920
Hold on, I'll walk you to the station.

447
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,790
Kanoko.

448
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,000
I will head to the station alone.

449
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,330
Otherwise my sadness will become unbearable.

450
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,270
You know, Kanoko.

451
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,250
I had actually asked Mr. Iwai how he could remain at your side,

452
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,340
what with your powers and all.

453
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,780
Really? What did he say?

454
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,960
He had said, to perceive lies

455
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,030
also meant seeing the truth.

456
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,740
To him, your ability is a solace.

457
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,390
It gives him the relief that someone believes in him.

458
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,120
Even now, I feel guilty that I couldn't protect you

459
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,740
when I was right at your side.

460
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,430
But I'm glad you met Mr. Iwai

461
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,200
after leaving our village.

462
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,720
I truly am.

463
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,280
Kanoko.

464
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,490
I'll see you again.

465
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,640
Mother.

466
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,030
Thank you...

467
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,090
for coming to visit me.

468
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,100
I'll write to you when I return.

469
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,950
Okay.

470
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,410
- Thanks again.
- Of course, come again.

471
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,090
Thank you.

472
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,990
Come again now.

473
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,630
Welcome back -

474
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,910
- Ma'am.
- Kanoko!

475
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,680
Have you see Mr. Iwai?

476
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,860
Mr. Iwai? He left early this morning. Said he had a job to do.

477
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,870
That was...

478
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,730
I recall he said he would be back by this evening.

479
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,180
A lie.

480
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,250
Is that so?

481
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,020
Thank you.

482
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,400
Why did Mrs. Kurata lie?

483
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,180
She must have her reasons.

484
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,060
- Are you alright?
- Ms. Urabe!

485
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,500
I mean -

486
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,140
Please, do not touch that.

487
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,350
- What?
- I'm alright, really.

488
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:26,120
- Sir, thank you for visiting yesterday.
- Yesterday?

489
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,820
Ah yes, it was an honor to meet your mother.

490
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,310
I've got that.

491
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,000
Have you seen Mr. Iwai?

492
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,200
Soma?

493
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,510
Oh, erm...

494
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,240
I have nothing to say on the matter.

495
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,880
Well then.

496
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,800
Good day.

497
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,220
He definitely knows something.

498
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,400
That surprised me.

499
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,330
She almost found out.

500
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,900
Will we manage to hold out until tomorrow night?

501
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,630
We should just tell -

502
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,330
This is for Kanoko's sake. We just want to surprise her a bit!

503
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,710
- It's a secret, Mr. Iwai.
- A secret.

504
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,250
A secret.

505
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,640
Mrs. Kurata lied,

506
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,210
while Mr. Hanasaki is hiding something.

507
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,960
What exactly happened to Mr. Iwai?

508
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,990
No, it's okay.

509
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:46,370
Those people would never hurt Mr. Iwai.

510
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,190
Even though I don't know why they lied,

511
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,190
I trust that it's nothing bad.

512
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,540
Right then.

513
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,130
[We shall solve your troubles - Iwai Detective Agency]

514
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,080
- Mr. Iwai.
- Welcome back, Ms. Kanoko.

515
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,540
I just returned as well.

516
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,220
Sir, where were you today...

517
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,030
Did you visit the Kurata's?

518
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,580
Is this about Mrs. Kurata's lie?

519
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,600
Mr. Hanasaki knows something as well.

520
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,000
I knew you'd worry about it.

521
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,140
It's okay.

522
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,950
I'll pretend I haven't caught on.

523
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,420
I see.

524
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,550
When I first hear a lie, I still end up assuming the worst.

525
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,470
It's not an easy habit to break.

526
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,370
You're not alone though.

527
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,130
People who can't detect lies go through the same experience.

528
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,310
They doubt the truth,

529
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,960
and grow anxious.

530
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,510
You've seen people lie for this very reason, no?

531
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,210
Sometimes what seems like a lie, turns out to be the truth.

532
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,600
And that makes situations even more troublesome.

533
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,990
Even if you didn't have that ability of yours,

534
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,360
I assume you'd be worrying just the same.

535
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,250
You just pick up on these lies more often than others do.

536
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,500
Which, in turn, leaves you less room to doubt the truth.

537
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,810
I'd say it's a fair trade-off.

538
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:52,210
Mr. Iwai always opens my eyes to a new perspective I was unaware of.

539
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,860
Let's go.

540
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,480
Sir, it seems they're closed already.
[We are closed for the night - The Kurata's]

541
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,180
Kanoko?

542
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,780
Ms. Urabe?

543
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,330
- Should I help?
- No, no need!

544
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,510
This has nothing to do with you, Kanoko.

545
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,970
Yes, this is... for a job Mr. Hanasaki has taken on!

546
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,890
- Isn't that right?
- I see.

547
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,840
- Mr. Iwai, let's head back.
- Oh darn!

548
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,930
I forgot they were secretly prepping for a Christmas party,

549
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:47,010
because Taro wanted to surprise you.

550
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,490
Mr. Iwai!

551
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,120
- Soma!
- Oops, let my mouth slip.

552
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,210
Mr. Iwai, our secret!

553
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,510
- Sorry about that.
- He...

554
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,060
He revealed the truth in front of everyone on purpose.

555
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,870
All so he wouldn't lie to me...

556
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,850
Unbelievable!

557
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:10,580
And so I wouldn't have to lie to all these people.

558
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,130
Excuse me.

559
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,260
Excuse me!

560
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:20,160
Please do not blame Mr. Iwai.

561
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:27,140
He has given me so much, I would never be able to repay him.

562
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,410
Not in my life.

563
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,830
He has?

564
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,380
What I mean to say is...

565
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,680
Alright, alright. If Kanoko insists.

566
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,530
Right, folks?

567
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,110
We'll be holding a Christmas party here tomorrow.

568
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,050
Look forward to it, okay?

569
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,140
I will.

570
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,580
Alright. Back to work! Mr. Iwai, you help Mr. Hanasaki.

571
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,870
Go on now.

572
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,370
Here.

573
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,940
See you tomorrow?

574
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,330
Yup.

575
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,340
Kanoko, we're ready!
[The next night]

576
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,670
I can head over now?

577
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,560
Yup. Let's go!

578
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,790
- Ready?
- Yup.

579
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,810
Kanoko.

580
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,130
Merry Christmas!

581
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,780
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

582
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,520
Go call them in.

583
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,040
Kanoko, dinner is ready.

584
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,670
Come eat it before it gets cold.

585
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,910
Okay.

586
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,490
- Alright.
- Come on in.

587
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,450
Welcome in, folks.

588
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,570
Mr. Iwai.

589
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,770
Me...

590
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,130
Me...

591
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,380
Merry...

592
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:10,890
Merry Christmas, Ms. Kanoko.

593
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,540
Merry Christmas, Mr. Iwai.

594
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,820
Kanoko, Mr. Iwai, hurry.

595
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,300
Sorry about that, Taro.

596
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,100
Hurry!

597
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,080
[To be continued]

598
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,830
Your landlady said I could stay a while.
[The finale is upon us!]

599
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,770
This is my office.
[A mysterious freeloader arrives at the agency?]

600
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,890
- My, do you have a guest tonight?
- This is my wife.

601
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:04,920
- Ron.
- Ron.

602
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,330
- You have got to be kidding.
- Inari's not here!

603
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,870
Kanoko, you must like Mr. Soma dearly.

604
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,280
You're lying to us, are you not?
[What exactly is this woman's end goal?]

605
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,600
I'm a liar.
[What exactly is this woman's end goal?]

606
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,030
I'll be adding her tab to your growing bill.

607
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,950
- Soma, come here.
- Is everything alright?

608
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,670
I wouldn't mind sleeping with you instead, Mr. Soma.

609
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,530
That's another lie.

610
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,970
Mr. Iwai.
