00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,840
Good morning, Kanoko.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,000
- Good morning.
- Morning!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,860
I see you're tidying up again?

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,130
This is all I can do to help, after all.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,120
I'm preparing some pickles as well.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,350
Since becoming Mr. Soma Iwai's assistant,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,050
my mornings start bright and early, cleaning up around the office.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,620
You'd share?

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,670
Thank you so much!

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,540
Sir, are you alright?

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,270
What an absolute hassle...

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,100
I tidied up around here the other day, did I not?

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,790
It's no use, the office always gets cluttered.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,010
Shall I brew some strong tea to help wake you?

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,380
Now that's a fragrant tea.

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,500
What sort of brew is this?

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,910
It's made of roasted silvergrass grains.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,470
The grains pop when you roast them.

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,010
Silvergrass grains? I never realized that could become a tea.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,670
It's a frugal, countryside recipe.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,710
- Mr. Iwai.
- Yes, my assistant?

22
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,690
You have no money, correct?

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,600
That, I do not.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,330
Then how do you have so much junk lying about?

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,790
So much... stuff lying about?

26
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,670
Are they perhaps materials relevant to cases around town?

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,520
Not at all.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
- They're stuff I got from people...
- Yes?

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,180
And stuff I received from others.

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,250
So this is the result of taking anything and everything

31
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,040
people had to give.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,770
Exactly, I never asked for any of this stuff.

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,270
That was a lie, wasn't it?

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,370
Whenever someone lies,

35
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,730
I am able to tell by their tone of voice.

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,160
I told no lie.

37
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,050
Mr. Iwai accepts my strange power for what it is.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,210
He doesn't shy away,

39
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,500
- nor feel especially put off by it.
- Thank you for the tea.

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,730
Any time.

41
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,780
Mr. Iwai has given me...

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,620
a place to call my own.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,400
- Ouch!
- Are you alright?

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,850
Yes, sorry about that.

45
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,270
Eureka.

Excuse us, coming through!

48
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,070
Morning, Gramps!

49

Move it, move it!

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,220
You alright, Ms. Kanoko?

51
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,220
- Pardon?
- Are you alright?

52
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,850
Yes!

53
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,410
- Ready, and...
- Ready, and...

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,920
- Careful there.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,210
I see you've brought quite the load again.

56
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,280
Still, this only amounts to about...

57
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,800
- Sorry, what was that?
- Like I said, this amounts to about 80 sen.
[T/N: A sen is equal to 0.01 of the modern yen]

58
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,540
Could you spare us a bit more?

59
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,030
What?

60
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm already offering plenty.

61
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,290
Try your luck somewhere else, and you'll see.

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,720
I can't offer any more, and that's final.

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,540
I see.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,650
- Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes?

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,350
Let's take his suggestion, and try our luck elsewhere.

66
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,230
I want as much money as we can get.

67
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,410
And the only ones losing out are myself, or the shopkeeper here.

68
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,140
But that's a gamble I'm willing to...

69
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,020
90 sen. I can't offer any more.

70
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,230
And sold!

71
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,320
Nothing gets past you, does it?

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,290
If you badgered me for any more, I would've chased you off to another store.

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,860
That was me, wasn't it?

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,030
What, you haven't had lunch either?

75
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,800
Actually, last night I passed out drunk by 60th Street,

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,310
and had my wallet snatched away.

77
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,020
The missus is furious, so I've been without a meal all day.

78
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,520
60th Street, you say.

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,980
I hear that area's gotten mighty dangerous, with pubs all around.

80
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,520
The place almost ate me alive, I'd say.

81
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,580
Take care of yourself out there, sir.

82
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,140
Will do.

83
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,200
I have returned.

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,730
- Welcome back.
- Hey there.

85
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,540
Sergeant Hanasaki, why not take a break?

86
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,210
I shall, thank you.

87
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,600
I'd surmise you didn't even take a lunch break?

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,540
It completely slipped my mind.

89
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,030
You need to let loose a bit, Sergeant.

90
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,030
No need, I've got that.

91
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,040
Thank you.

92
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,950
Did something catch your eye?

93
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,410
Ah, that's the restaurant that opened up by 60th Street.

94
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,850
A luxurious place the likes of us would never find ourselves in.

95
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,550
That, we would not.

96
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,740
What a roaring success.

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,020
I can't believe we finally cleared up all that junk.

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,710
So that was junk after all.

99
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,720
In any case, I'm glad we could sell high.

100
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,810
I owe today's success to you, my assistant.

101
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,720
How about we have soba for lunch today?

102
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,700
Maybe I'll splurge and get an egg on top too.

103
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,740
Say, you two there.

104
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,090
Come eat at our place instead.

105
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,690
Our meals taste far better than their soba.

Thank you, come again!

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,480
It sure tastes great when you actually pay for a meal.

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,660
Indeed. This was the most delicious soba I've ever...

117
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,190
- Isn't that...
- Hm?

118
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,500
I believe you were cooking it at the stall the other day.

119
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,260
You haven't had one yet?

120
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,470
- No.
- Then I've done you a disservice.

121
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,860
If I don't warn you ahead of time, you could face a disaster.

122
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,160
A disaster?

123
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,220
Those things are cheap, and a real saving grace to us poor folk.

But...

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,280
- Good, the gramps is cooking today.
- Huh?

126
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,560
They pack these things with leftovers, so it's different every day.

127
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,160

She packs things like canned mackerel and mandarins together,

131
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,550
which marries the flavors of raw fish and sour fruit.

132
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,120

We just ate lunch, and you're buying more?

137
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,700

Not at all. Tidying up is really all I can do to help.

Look at this lady here.

180
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,410
Might this not be the Moss Rose Angel?

181
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,580
The Moss Rose Angel?

182
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,980
She is someone I owe my life to.

183
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,730
- What?
- Owe your life to?

184
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,980
- You're overreacting.
- It's true.

185
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,420
I thought I was dying.

186
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,600
Over that?

187
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,420
Yes, no thanks to you.

188
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,770
- What?
- No need to humor him, Ms. Kanoko.

189
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,170
Ms. Urabe ought to know the truth.

190
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,660
- Now please, sit.
- Don't act like you own the place.

191
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,280
Have a seat, I insist.

192
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,160
So, what exactly happened?

193
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,210
Last month,

194
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,400
I was doing work on the landlady's farm

195
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,770
- with this guy here.
- Because you begged for help.

196
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,360
Except,

197
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,910
after we finished our work, Kaoru's stomach broke down.

198
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,780
You left out some details.

199
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,750
I fell ill because of the Tsukumoyaki you shared with me.

200
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,260
This tastes sour.

201
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,680
Huh, you're right.

202
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,510
I don't think I've ever encountered a flavor like this before.

203
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,050
I disagree.

204
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,710
This tastes familiar somehow.

205
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,540
How so?

206
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,190
Think harder, I'm curious.

207
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,860
This is the grannie's work, it could be anything.

208
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,500
No it isn't. Gramps was manning the stall today.

209
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,200
These are from three days ago.

210
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,870
My stomach...

211
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,140
My stomach hurts!

212
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,750
- You're overreacting.
- Bastard... How are you completely unaffected?

213
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,130
Because I train for this on the daily.

214
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,590
And because I eat weeds on the daily, too.

215
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm going to die... Die, I say...

216
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,190
I'll fetch you some water from the well.

217
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,750
Sir, are you alright?

218
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,670
The one who eased my pain, may very well be this woman here.

219
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,280
Unfortunately, I do not remember my savior's face.

220
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,940
Allow me to loosen your tie.

221
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,320
All I can recall,

222
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,990
is that her inner kimono was patterned with moss roses.

223
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,260
That, and the fact that she smelled quite nice.

224
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,230
Pardon?

225
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,840
I-In any case, I fainted soon after,

226
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,330
only to awaken at the clinic.

227
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,010
And who do you think carried you there?

228
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,790
I want to thank this mysterious lady.

229
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,380
Thank me instead.

230
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,190
Why should I? You almost killed me.

231
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,530
I should be arresting you.

232
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,380
That's just ridiculous...

233
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,410
I cannot recall her face, let alone pin a name to it.

234
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,680
But I think this woman here may be the one.

235
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,020
How about it, Soma?

236
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,070
I know you saw her face.

237
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,700
Is she the one?

238
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,790
Nope.

239
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,270
You got the wrong lady.

240
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,000
Soma.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
Take a real good look at her.

242
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,120
See?

243
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,460
Isn't she the one?

244
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,960
I see.

245
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,350
I suppose a vague impression isn't enough to be a lead.

246
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,460
Exactly.

247
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,920
I know I can count on your memory, if not anything else.

248
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,180
If not anything else? Rude.

249
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,310
I shall take my leave.

250
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,480
Thank you for having me.

251
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,190
Allow me to see you out.

252
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
Ms. Urabe.

253
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,690
Yes?

254
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,170
I'm sure it must be difficult to work under a man like Soma.

255
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,490
But I'm glad he now has a competent assistant like yourself.

256
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,590
Despite our differences, he is my oldest friend after all.

257
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,540
Your friend...

258
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,890
I hope that you take great care of him.

259
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,410
Of course... I mean, the sentiment is mine.

260
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,200
I shall see you both around.

261
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,040
Mr. Hanasaki is an old friend.

262
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,350
So then why did Mr. Iwai lie to him?

263
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,860
If he lied about who was in that picture,

264
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,080
that means that lady is the Moss Rose Angel.

265
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:40,710
Mr. Iwai knows I am able to detect his lies, right?

266
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,630
You wish to test my powers?
[Several days ago]

267
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,810
Yup. There are many different types of lies out there.

268
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,720
We ought to see what you can detect, and what you can't.

269
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I see.

270
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,750
Speak up if I'm lying, okay?

271
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,500
- Alright.
- Then here I go.

272
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,660
I'm actually incredibly rich.

273
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,280
That was a lie.

274
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,600
Maybe that was too easy.

275
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,230
What about this?
[Left: I am rich - Right: I am poor]

276
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,240
They look the same to me.
[Left: I am rich - Right: I am poor]

277
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,260
Then what about if I rip them?

278
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,250
They sound the same as well.

279
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,220
I've only ever picked up on abnormalities from people's voices.

280
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,900
Interesting.

281
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,660
In that case...

282
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,450
Sit here.

283
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,270
Yes, sir.

284
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,490
And face forward.

285
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,250
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,470
Woah, there's an entire wad of cash just sitting here!

287
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,720
That's another lie.

288
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,660
So line of sight doesn't matter.

289
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,090
You only need to hear the lie to detect it.

290
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,320
Sir, how about we talk about something other than money?

291
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,350
Fair point.

292
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,350
I was getting a bit depressed lying about riches as well.

293
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,140
Now, this is where the true experiment begins.

294
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,740
It will rain tomorrow.

295
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,880
That was not a lie.

296
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,890
Next. It won't rain tomorrow.

297
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,660
That wasn't a lie either.

298
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,240
I see.

299
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,890
But how can that be?

300
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,680
One of them will become false, but you couldn't tell which.

301
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,190
This means your powers can't verify any unknown factors.

302
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,820
I never knew.

303
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,390
This also means we can't use your powers to gamble, and win big.

304
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,780
I can't believe you even considered the possibility...

305
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,350
How about this?

306
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,900
It will rain tomorrow.

307
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,220
That was a lie.

308
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,140
But why?

309
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,200
It's the same unknown variable as before.

310
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,260
It will always be impossible to predict the weather, whether that be tomorrow or years in the future.

311
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,130
The only thing I changed, was my intent.

312
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,500
Your intent?

313
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,140
The first time I spoke, I was merely stating two potential outcomes.

314
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,370
But this time, I was stating my opinion.

315
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,060
I personally think it will be sunny tomorrow.

316
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,910
So I made my claim, with the intent to lie.

317
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,510
Your power doesn't detect hidden truths.

318
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,040
It detects someone's intent to lie.

319
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,420
Their intent to lie...

320
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,350
In other words, even if a person has been misled in their beliefs,

321
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,010
if they think they are correct, then it won't sound like a lie.

322
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,260
Let's head back, shall we?

323
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:12,060
I've never tried facing my ability in earnest before.

324
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,880
Nor has anyone bothered to try.

325
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,860
- Here you go.
- That looks so good.

326
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,190
Which is why I can't ask him this burning question of mine...

327
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,890
Ms. Kanoko?

328
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,830
Yes?

329
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,600
Don't tell me... does your stomach hurt?

330
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,590
No, not at all.

331
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,390
- Roasted saury for me too, please.
- Coming up.

332
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,710
- Here.
- Good evening.

333
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,800
- Welcome, Mr. Hanasaki.
- Come on in.

334
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,280
Have a seat, I insist.

335
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,050
Don't act like you own the place.

336
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,910
And what of your tab?

337
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm a paying customer today.

338
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,130
How much do you want? One? Two?

339
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,030
- Good evening.
- Evening to you as well.

340
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,660
Will you be having a beer?

341
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,950
Yes, thank you.

342
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,560
How absolutely beautiful...

343
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,740
- Pardon?
- What?

344
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,540
Ah, my apologies.

345
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,280
Oh, you mean the flowers.

346
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,550
Those are moss roses.

347
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,270
Perhaps they stayed in bloom for you, Mr. Hanasaki.

348
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,880
Mr. Hanasaki's a fan of flowers? You really can't judge a book by its cover.

349
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,650
He works a difficult job, dear.

350
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,420
Flowers must soothe him.

351
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,490
Isn't that right, Mr. Iwai?

352
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,020
Forget about her already.

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,850
- Why?
- She was only a passerby.

354
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,750
I would like to thank her in person.

355
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,110
That's all?

356
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,620
I would also like to...

357
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,450
get to know her.

358
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,760
There are plenty of other beautiful ladies who smell nice.

359
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,740
But she is the only woman I owe my life to.

360
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,540
Do not make light of my earnest feelings.

361
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,280
Why does Mr. Iwai insist on keeping the truth?

362
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,310
Now, now. Leave it at that.

363
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,980
You can't judge a book by its cover.

364
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,720
I see. So a detective can judge character in a single glance.

365
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,270
Was there something you wished to add?

366
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,730
Only that we know absolutely nothing about this woman.

367
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,750
Pops, I think this saury is looking good.

368
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,240
No need to tell me.

369
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,000
I think the fire's a bit weak.

370
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,040
Right.

371
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,250
I can't blame you for your lack of interest.

372
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,610
- Thank you for having me.
- Already?

373
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,510
You haven't even eaten a bite of food.

374
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,640
Isn't this where you two make up over a hearty dinner?

375
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,890
What exactly is Mr. Iwai trying to hide by lying?

376
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,560
- Still...
- Thank you.

377
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,910
Mr. Iwai.

378
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,710
- Take care!
- You sure about letting him go?

379
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,100
- Pops, it's burning!
- That's not our priority here.

380
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,720
Everyone has a thing or two they'd rather not be pressed about.

381
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,950
Especially if those are lies.

382
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm sure the same applies to Mr. Iwai.

383
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,710
You don't feel disturbed, having me around?

384
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,300
Not at all.

385
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,210
I don't want Mr. Iwai to come to dislike me.

386
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:49,690
♫ ♫

387
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,010
♫ ♫

388
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:04,160
♫ ♫

389
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,360
Thank you, come again.

390
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,190
Welcome back, Taro!

391
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,360
- Hello there.
- How was school? Are you having fun?

392
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,570
- It's okay.
- You're growing up fast, kid.

393
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,370
Here, on me.

394
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,790
- Thank you, sir.
- Of course.

395
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,620
No one's a fan of school when they're young.

396
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,240
Believe it or not, I was actually a gifted kid.

397
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,950
Could I also get one kabocha squash?
[Yaoroku Vegetables]

398
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,220
I see you're buying big today.

399
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,220
Here you are.

400
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,700
I'll also take two...

401
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,420
No, one lotus root.

402
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,060
And a bundle of spinach, and chives please.

403
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,780
Sure thing.

404
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,480
Oh, I only asked for a bundle each...

405
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,540
I'm sure you're struggling at Mr. Iwai's place.

406
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,000
Take it as a down payment for when I need his services, yeah?

407
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,260
Thank you very much.

408
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,290
But actually, I have a bit of pocket change today -

409
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,520
Are you alright?

410
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,160
- Sir?
- Money... money...

411
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,740
- Are you alright?
- Chives.

412
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,660
What was that?

413
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,600
I haven't seen that man around these parts before.

414
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,970
In any case, please allow me to pay for our groceries today.

415
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,270
You sure?

416
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,400
Well, if you insist.

417
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,540
I have returned.

418
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,500
Mr. Iwai?

419
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,490
Inari! Is Mr. Iwai out?

420
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,790
Ms. Chiyo?

421
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,420
Good day to you.

422
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,550
I suppose it looks edible.

423
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,920
What brings you to Tsukumoyacho, Ms. Chiyo?

424
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,010
That is a secret.

425
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,410
I was simply passing by the area.

426
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,080
Is that so?

427
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,650
I absolutely did not come with the intent of seeing Mr. Soma.

428
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,940
Is that so.

429
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,990
- It seems you see right through me.
- Huh?

430
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,470
Yes?

431
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,350
I mean, never mind.

432
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,200
How is it?

433
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,660
It tastes quite bland.

434
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,640
She really means it.

435
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
Say.

436
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Yes?

437
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,400
Does Mr. Soma live in that abode?

438
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,650
Yes. That is his home.

439
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,380
I live there as well.

440
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,050
- You live together?
- Yes.

441
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,040
Though I'm only borrowing the guest room upstairs, that is all.

442
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,780
Sir, do you have a reservation with us?

443
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,890
- Ouch!
- What are you doing, you uncouth coot!

444
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,050
- I shall call the police on you.
- Grannie...

445
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,860
Dear?

446
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,210
My apologies, miss.

447
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,470
Where have you gone, my dearest?

448
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,760
Do you recall this novel?

449
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,670
Shurei Bimoku, yes?

450
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,120
Hideyoshi Mayume.

451
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,700
You see, I absolutely adore detective mystery novels.

452
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,280
And one day, I am going to write a mystery novel of my own.

453
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,350
- You wish to pen a novel?
- Yes.

454
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,340
My detective shall not let a single piece of evidence evade them.

455
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,330
They will be both smart, and attractive as well.

456
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,540
I've even named this detective of mine.

457
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,210
That sounds like a wonderful dream.

458
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,950
This is no dream.

459
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,040
It is my future.

460
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,730
- Mr. Kokichi!
- Do not ignore me.

461
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,630
Hello there, Ms. Urabe.

462
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,710
I'm glad to see you are well.

463
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,690
I owe my prosperity and continued trust to Mr. Iwai and yourself.

464
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,320
My lady, we must get going.

465
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,410
Ms. Kanoko.

466
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,720
Yes?

467
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,440
What is your dream?

468
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,300
- My dream?
- Was it to become a detective's assistant?

469
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,880
Well then, good day.

470
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,850
A dream? I've never even considered having one.

471
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,550
I'm bringing the pot over.

472
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,920
Alright.

473
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,550
Wait a moment.

474
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,280
- Careful, it's hot.
- Hold on.

475
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,100
Here.

476
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,070
I can't believe I get to eat something as luxurious as hot pot.

477
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,140
Not to mention it's your cooking.

478
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,410
I'm seriously a lucky guy.

479
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,780
I hope it suits your tastebuds.

480
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,980
- Time to dig in.
- Please do.

481
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,420
This is delicious.

482
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,550
I'm glad to hear it.

483
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,100
Mr. Iwai.

484
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't tell me...

485
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,980
You can eat weeds, but not chives?

486
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,820
No, I can eat anything.

487
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,100
These chives look amazing.

488
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,820
Can't have hot pot without chives.

489
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,880
Don't look at me like that.

490
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,760
I'll admit I dislike them. Satisfied?

491
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,490
I can't help but be curious.

492
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,540
He knows I can tell, so why does he still lie?

493
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,870
Mr. Iwai. I have to ask -

494
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,260
- Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes?

495
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,680
Could you run an errand for me?

496
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,450
Of course.

497
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,430
One moment.

498
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,170
Found it.

499
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,230
Glad I still had it.

500
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,960
There.

501
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,500
- Do you remember how to get to the pawnshop?
- Yes.

502
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,460
Then could you hand that to the shopkeeper tomorrow?

503
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,280
Of course.

504
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,510
Just this?

505
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,730
I'll be back.

506
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,930
See you later.

507
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,020
See you, Mr. Iwai.

508
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,020
A delivery from Soma?

509
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,950
Yes. He asked me to hand you this.

510
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,740
A teacup saucer?

511
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,570
And just a single one, too.

512
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,010
Excuse me.

513
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,980
Yes?

514
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,310
I want to ask about that picture there.

515
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,090
This one?

516
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,220
Yes.

517
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,490
How do I get to that store from here?

518
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,040
This store is around 60th Street. Give me a minute.

519
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,500
Thank you.

520
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,700
That's right.

521
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,700
I could simply go there, and see the truth for myself.

522
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,200
It's time I figure out if this is the Moss Rose Angel, or not.

523
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,950
That way.

524
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,980
If I meet this individual,

525
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:27,680
I can simply ask if she helped a man who was experiencing stomach pain.

526
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:33,300
And then, I can tell Mr. Hanasaki her whereabouts if she did.

527
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,040
This looks like a luxurious restaurant...

528
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,960
Am I allowed to go inside?

529
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,580
Did you need something?

530
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,480
No, sorry!

531
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,430
Was that a customer?

532
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,040
- No, ma'am.
- Is that so.

533
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,520
"Excuse me."

534
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,680
"Did you help a man who was experiencing stomach pain?"

535
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,180
Alright.

536
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,630
I ask her, and then what?

537
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,230
You got the wrong lady.

538
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,280
Take a real good look at her.

539
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,270
Forget about her already.

540
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,790
Do not make light of my earnest feelings.

541
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:34,980
Despite our differences, he is my oldest friend after all.

542
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,020
No. I cannot let things end like this.

543
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,660
Leaving already?

544
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,650
Mr. Iwai!

545
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,240
Why hesitate?

546
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,390
You came to ask her about Kaoru, did you not?

547
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,280
Sir, why did you lie about her?

548
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,160
The woman in the photo was indeed the one Mr. Hanasaki was searching for.

549
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,690
Mr. Hanasaki's intuition was on the mark.

550
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:30,850
So then... why did you lie to your best friend?

551
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,500
Over here!

552
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,410
- Act like we're together.
- "Together"?

553
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,890
- Inside this store.
- Yes, sir.

554
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,430
There, there she is!

555
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,250
That wench stole my wallet!

556
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,900
You there, do not move.

557
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,440
What is all this commotion about?

558
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,160
This woman stole your wallet?

559
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,570
I ask that you lower your voices, sirs.

560
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,850
Yes, I'm certain.

561
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,220
Sir, I do not know you.

562
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,080
You'd best fess up while you can.

563
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,390
That lady pretends to help, only to steal wallets. It's a common tactic.

564
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,650
- But no one ever forgets a pretty face.
- Who exactly are you, sir?

565
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,980
Feign innocence all you want, but I remember your face.

566
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,830
And this article helped me track you down.

567
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,360
- You absolute wench!
- Sir, calm yourself!

568
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,530
I know nothing!

569
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,000
- One moment, ma'am.
- What are you -

570
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,380
We have questions to ask.

571
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,480
Let me go!

572
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,900
- Take her away.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,210
- Come on.
- Ouch!

574
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:22,600
It seems I truly am no match for you, am I?

575
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,620
Ms. Kanoko.

576
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,890
Yes, sir?

577
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,390
Let's head home. I'm sure you're hungry.

578
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,420
Yes, sir...

579
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,860
I see we have a full moon tonight.

580
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,900
Let's stop for some soba again.

581
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,200
Mr. Iwai...

582
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,060
Sir?

583
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,600
Let's make some more grain tea, too.

584
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,630
I was quite a fan, you know?

585
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:32,860
Sir, did you know the truth all along?

586
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,640
That the Moss Rose Angel was a thief?

587
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,450
Yup.

588
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:45,990
That lady wasn't helping Kaoru, she was trying to take his wallet.

589
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,800
At least, that's what I think.

590
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,390
Sir, are you alright?

591
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,840
Allow me to loosen your tie.

592
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,890
I shall call for a doctor.

593
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,240
But she noticed I was watching,

594
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,650
and left without stealing a thing.

595
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,330
When the ol' man at the pawnshop told us his story,

596
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,610
I thought it might be the same thief.

597
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,540
Turns out I was entirely right.

598
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,570
That's why you had me deliver that saucer to the pawnshop,

599
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,320
wrapped in that very article.

600
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,200
So the reason why you lied to Mr. Hanasaki, was because...

601
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,190
In any case.

602
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,060
Kaoru had nothing stolen from him,

603
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,950
and he never actually saw the lady.

604
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,490
There was no need for me to play cupid,

605
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:56,960
only for a simpleton like him to suffer a broken heart.

606
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,000
Is she the one?

607
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,010
Nope.

608
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,190
Meaning you lied...

609
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,940
for Mr. Hanasaki's sake.

610
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,790
Sure, that's one reason.

611
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,010
But rather than for his sake, I lied for a certain other individual...

612
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,920
- Wait, me?
- Yes, you.

613
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,600
When you noticed I was lying to Kaoru,

614
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,040
you were worrying all on your own, weren't you?

615
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,740
- Well...
- And despite making it here,

616
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,780
you couldn't ask the lady any questions,

617
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,570
and ended up pressing me for answers instead.

618
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,350
You were tailing me?

619
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,310
My favorite part was when you were at the pawnshop.

620
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,480
You asked that ol' man about the picture straight!

621
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,730
I expected nothing less.

622
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,600
I want to ask about that picture there.

623
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,220
How do I get to that store from here?

624
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,450
Sir, where are you taking that!

625
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,210
This one? This store is around 60th Street.

626
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,340
What an absolute riot.

627
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,830
Hold on. Did you lie on purpose,

628
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,190
to see how I'd react?

629
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,420
Bingo.

630
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,120
W-What in the...

631
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:24,030
Just because you can detect lies doesn't mean you can see right through me.

632
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,040
If I really felt up to it,

633
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,860
I could dupe you, easy peasy.

634
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,580
- Say what?
- You have much to learn.

635
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,340
What was even the point of all this?

636
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,440
The point?

637
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,950
The point is that I'm here to accept you, powers and all.

638
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,220
I thought we should talk about it.

639
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,280
You've been worried about how I feel, right?

640
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,730
That I may be put off, knowing you'd see through my lies.

641
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,260
I've never once thought your powers were simply useful, and without detriment.

642
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,510
I recognize that if we stay together,

643
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,450
there will be pros and cons to both the one hearing the lies,

644
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,560
and the one knowing they're being heard.

645
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,430
But I don't want you to worry on your own.

646
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,000
Because you're not alone, not anymore.

647
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,440
We stay together, we worry about this together.

648
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,560
I'm here to share the burden, okay?

649
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,860
I've never had someone accept me...

650
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,630
to acknowledge my ability for all that it is,

651
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:07,940
and not shy away from it.

652
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,330
Mr. Iwai.

653
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,800
Yes?

654
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,810
The moon is beautiful tonight.

655
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,800
Ms. Kanoko.

656
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,160
How about we eat some soba on our way home?

657
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,010
Yes, let's.

658
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,840
I want to be of use to Mr. Iwai.

659
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,110
That, is my current dream.

660
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,290
[To be continued]

661
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,030
We've reached the Ayao's place.

The Doll House, where a person was found dead.

663

What a large manor.

The dolls reside in a separate dwelling.

The one found lying dead, was a doll.
[An accursed doll, a harbinger of further turmoil?]

666
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,920
Ms. Shinako?
[An accursed doll, a harbinger of further turmoil?]

667
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,530
- Is that...
- Blood?

668
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,820
- You're running off into the night?
- More like morning.

669
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,930
Sir, you mustn't!

670
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,250
I have baggage handlers right here.

671
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,150
They shall manage just fine.

672
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,250
- Are you alright?
- Yes, sorry about that.

673
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,820
I won't force you to speak up.

674
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,360
But you're acting quite obvious.
