1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,150
A series of doll killings that occurred at the Doll House,

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,450
a manor with a custom for nurturing dolls.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,250
The one lying dead, was a doll.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,150
A woman was bleeding out,

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,840
alongside an expensive looking doll.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,880
Rumor said the master of this manor looked to be a doll herself.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,100
She introduced herself as "Shinako".

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,430
No one has died here,

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,730
and Ms. Ine's death was a suicide.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,230
Yet Shinako's exclamation was a lie.

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,030
Is that... blood?

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,670
- What?
- I'll go ask for a key.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,280
"Twins are harbingers of disaster."

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,370
You must've heard the superstition before.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,760
Ms. Shinako!

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,500
- Ms. Shinako -
- This is... a doll.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,040
But this is blood.

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,150
The kimono here is gone.

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,360
What?

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,400
Ms. Shinako...

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,910
Why have you entered Shinako's room?

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,830
I said you mustn't enter aside from bringing in meals.

23
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,250
Ms. Shinako?

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,620
Is that really you?

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,070
Ms. Shinako, that blood...

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,200
Huh? Mr. Iwai?

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,910
My, the gate to the garden is open.

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,760
Miss!

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,910
Did you get hurt?

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,500
I was trimming a stray yarn on a doll.

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,900
But the doll lost balance, and as it fell over,

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,340
I accidentally cut myself with the scissors.

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,360
This is a lot of blood for a small injury...

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,690
It was a bad cut, that was all.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,520
We're terribly sorry, Ms. Shinako.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,780
- Soma?
- We owe her an apology, Miyabi.

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,390
We were supposed to reconvene at breakfast.

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,580
Now let's head back.

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,480
Jeez, look at the mess we've made of their dinner.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,550
All this delicious rice, clam soup, and burdock root, on the floor.

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,830
I especially enjoyed the croquette - it was just so crisp.

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,490
Wouldn't you agree, Ms. Shinako?

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,950
I mean, you ate this meal with us yesterday after all.

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes, I enjoyed our meal.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,260
Ms. Shinako.

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,330
It's absolutely criminal to waste such delicious food.

47
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,760
We shall talk again over breakfast.

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,340
Miyabi, let's return to the manor.

49
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,380
- What?
- Come now, hurry.

50
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,370
- O-Okay?
- Careful - Oh, right!

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,780
She'll pay for this glass.

52
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,530
- What?
- Let's go. You too, Ms. Kanoko.

53
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,390
Hurry, Miyabi. We could miss breakfast.

54
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,420
- What, huh?
- Dinner was just so delicious.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,500
We can't miss out on breakfast - great timing, Ms. Housemaid!

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,860
- Let us prepare for breakfast.
- Huh?

57
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,840
- I'm craving a rice ball.
- Hold on!

58
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,440
Does this manor have a car or phone line?

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,550
- There is a phone.
- Call the police, now.

60
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,040
T-The police?

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,160
Call for a car and doctor as well. Ms. Shinako is gravely hurt.

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,400
She's hurt?

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,260
- What happened?
- We'll explain later,

64
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,760
just please call for a car, doctor, and an officer.

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,870
Yes sir, right away.

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,060
You believe Ms. Shinako is hurt, sir?

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,420
A small cut would never amount to that much blood.

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,410
Indeed, she was certainly lying about that.

69
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,590
With the blood we saw, she shouldn't even be able to move.

70
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,590
- And...
- Yes, I enjoyed our meal.

71
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,200
That answer was another lie.

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,920
- A lie?
- Exactly. She didn't eat with us.

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,030
- A lie, how?
- The one who's hurt, is the Shinako we met yesterday.

74
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,270
- Yesterday?
- Come again?

75
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,740
The Shinako we just met in the dwelling wasn't the one from yesterday.

76
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,890
She's a completely separate individual.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,210
[Usotoki Rhetoric]
[Episode 5]

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,670
I knew it, Ms. Shinako is a twin.

79
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,270
They're two pretending to be one.

80
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,100
No, I am not a twin.

81
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,000
But Ms. Shinako herself said she wasn't.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,420
- And that was a lie.
- No, it wasn't.

83
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,910
How can you be certain?

84
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,040
If Ms. Shinako isn't a twin...

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,170
- What?
- Then the first Shinako is the one we met today.

86
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,760
The second, is the Shinako we met yesterday who's gravely hurt.

87
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,750
But there's one more.

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,470
A third Shinako, who died a month ago.

89
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,830
There were three Shinako's.

90
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't guarantee there are no more, but...

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,140
She wasn't a twin, because they were triplets?

92
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,560
- H-Hey!
- So then Ms. Ine didn't see a doll,

93
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,990
but rather, an actual person?

94
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,380
A manor which mixes doll and human, and a body count that doesn't add up.

95
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,340
One of the three Shinako's must have died,

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,270
while the other two covered up her death, by making her a "doll".

97
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,940
Sir, something else doesn't add up.

98
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,590
Ms. Shinako said she was alone in this manor.

99
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,160
Then she lied about being alone.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,950
- Isn't that right?
- Only Shinako resides in this manor.

101
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,720
She wasn't lying.

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,770
- How?
- Exactly. She wasn't.

103
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,890
- Why?
- Because she was never the only "Shinako".

104
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,950
Ms. Kanoko. You address yourself by saying "I", don't you?

105
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,900
She refers to herself with "I" .

106
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,460
Right. But when she's talking about Shinako as a collective,

107
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,720
or the other Shinako's, she refers to them as "Shinako".

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,390
She's differentiated them all from the start.

109
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,190
Now that I think about it...

110
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,920
I caught a journalist attempting to grab a photograph of me.

111
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,470
Shinako said no, but they insisted.

112
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,170
They said this was for Shinako's sake.

113
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,280
It is something Mother and Father left behind for Shinako.

114
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,740
I've grown quite hungry as well.

115
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,900
The Shinako's were triplets pretending to be one individual.

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,660
Is that even possible?

117
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,590
Their doll-like fashion

118
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,700
with their straight cut hair and gaudy kimonos,

119
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,880
were to distract from their minor differences in appearance.

120
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,800
This custom of raising dolls is a mechanism to make it seem like there's only one "Shinako".

121
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,720
While we don't know why the Ayao couple chose to do this,

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,340
the Shinako's have upheld this tradition

123
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,370
long after their parents' passing.

124
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,030
And even now that one Shinako is gone.

125
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,700
If we don't act, the Shinako we met yesterday will meet the same fate as the first.

126
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,590
She'll become a doll.

127
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,030
We have to save her!

128
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,560
We have no proof that there are two Shinako's yet.

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,750
We'll have to find the other Shinako,

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,890
or else she'll end up like the first.

131
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,750
Find her, but where?

132
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,160
There was no other injured Shinako in that dwelling.

133
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,680
The body of the first Shinako also disappeared somewhere.

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,570
And we certainly won't be getting any answers from the Shinako now.

135
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,790
But I have my suspicions, so I'll go search there.

136
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,490
- I'll join you.
- That won't be possible in a kimono.

137
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,270
Miyabi, I need you to convey this story to the police, and to search the manor grounds.

138
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,930
Ms. Kanoko...

139
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,790
Could I ask you to keep watch over Ms. Shinako?

140
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,980
Yes, sir.

141
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,310
- Make sure you always keep sight of her.
- Right.

142
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,770
I'll have Kubo accompany me.

143
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,480
H-Hey!

144
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,350
I have questions for you two!

145
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,010
Are you listening to me?

146
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,140
So this is where you were fishing?

147
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,640
Yes.

148
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,740
And Ms. Ine was found dead over there.

149
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,310
Indeed.

150
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,190
And you also thought you saw someone up there?

151
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,510
Right.

152
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,810
- Then let's head up there.
- What?

153
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,020
I didn't realize you were a doctor, Mr. Shibata.

154
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,520
The only doctor in this village, in fact.

155
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,020
I already told you, that's just impossible!

156
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,310
You haven't even investigated the premises.

157
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,980
The Ayao's are a rich family who own all the land atop this mountain.

158
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,710
Don't accuse me of slacking off!

159
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,670
You saw the blood on her kimono.

160
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,480
A mere cut would never amount to that much blood!

161
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,870
You talk big for an absolute amateur.

162
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,350
Say what?

163
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,830
Good day, Dr. Shibata.

164
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,020
Hello there.

165
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,290
Do not call the police on a mere conjecture.

166
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,980
What the? What happened to this glass door?

167
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,480
This area looks suspicious...

168
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,100
In any case, police are busy folk.

169
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,110
- We toil away every day.
- Oh shut it, you.

170
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,680
This is quite the difficult trek.

171
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,640
It's definitely impossible to climb up here in a kimono.

172
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,110
Yes indeed...

173
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,210
Are you faring alright in those leather shoes?

174
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,140
Frankly, not really.

175
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,830
Now listen here.

176
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,100
I've been awarded "Best Police Chief in the Prefecture" three times now.

177
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,660
Then get to investigating already.

178
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,540
Assist us for an hour, and if there's nothing, we'll call this off.

179
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,410
You're making me search here for a whole hour?

180
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,600
Maybe it really was my imagination.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,780
Let's head up here anyway.

182
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,540
What? You say there are two Shinako's?

183
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,140
Leave that sort of bogus behind in your sham of a journal.

184
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,640
- Bogus?
- Yeah.

185
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,590
- Sham of a journal?
- That's right.

186
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,190
How absolutely rude.

187
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,800
The one thing backing Mr. Iwai's theory,

188
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,330
is the lie only I can hear.

189
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,580
Are these folks telling the truth?

190
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,910
This amount of blood seems a bit much for a cut like this...

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,440
Is there someone else that is hurt?

192
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,190
No, sir.

193
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,420
They only speak lies.

194
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,380
It's as Mr. Iwai says.

195
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,670
We lack the necessary proof.

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,710
She was standing here, right?

197
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,490
Yes.

198
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,410
I must have been imagining things.

199
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,230
No, there was someone here.

200
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,530
Like hell there's someone else here!

201
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,660
Now I have dirt in every pocket...

202
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,600
There is no "other" Shinako.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,650
This search is a waste of time.

204
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,820
If you're so certain, where is your proof?

205
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,480
My keen, sleuthing intuition is proof enough.

206
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,820
That's no proof at all!

207
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,680
I shouldn't sit here, and simply watch over her.

208
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,580
I ought to be helping somehow.

209
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,400
If there's one thing I can do,

210
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,270
it's to coax out Ms. Shinako's lies.

211
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,190
- Mimic her.
- Huh?

212
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,320
Mimic the way you saw this individual standing on this cliff.

213
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,930
I'm pretty sure she stood here, facing this way.

214
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,470
There's only person around these parts who would be wearing a draping kimono.

215
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,440
Ms. Shinako.

216
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,910
Is the other Shinako injured?

217
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,360
I already told you. There is no "other" Shinako.

218
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,980
- I can coax out her lies all I want.
- See? She said there's no other.

219
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,060
- But what am I supposed to do with that information?
- Ugh, you're impossible!

220
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,110
I knew it. Without Mr. Iwai around...

221
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,100
It's alright.

222
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,950
For now, let's imagine there was an individual here.

223
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,890
The path we took would be impossible for a woman in a kimono.

224
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,670
Which means...

225
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,440
This way?

226
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,310
But there's no property over there.

227
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,460
Onwards.

228
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,200
R-Really?

229
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,680
Hold on!

230
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,620
I'd love to go to Tokyo one day myself.

231
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,670
- Pardon?
- I hear that Kenichi Enomoto puts on a real fun show up there.
[T/N: a Japanese comedian from 1922-1970]

232
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,580
This is no time for Enomoto nor Roppa.
[T/N: Roppa Furukawa; a Japanese comedian from the 1930's]

233
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,420
I'd love to meet that Enomoto fella.

234
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,230
You're useless.

235
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,620
Now then, may I take my leave, Miss?

236
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,030
There's still a patient here...

237
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,870
I am the only one who is hurt.

238
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,570
You may leave.

239
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,970
Please wait!

240
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,780
Hold on.

241
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,280
Huh?

242
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,040
What might that be?

243
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,420
It looks to be a grave.

244
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Are you leaving, Doc?

245
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,340
Then I think I shall join you.

246
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,440
Hey!

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,100
Please wait a moment longer. I beg you.

248
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,930
We must save Ms. Shinako, this time for certain.

249
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,050
This time?

250
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,460
"Ms. Shinako"...

251
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,950
was actually three separate individuals.

252
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,280
You found it.

253
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,590
Seems like we were on the mark.

254
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,830
You folks are completely off the mark.

255
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,250
Your theory was far from correct.

256
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,870
I mean, look here.

257
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,450
Ms. Shinako is, and has always been one individual.

258
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,460
End of story.

259
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,420
There were three of them.

260
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,710
There is the Shinako we see here,

261
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,240
the one who is gravely hurt,

262
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,190
and...

263
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,750
the one who passed away, one month ago.

264
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,320
Is this path connected to the Doll House?

265
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,560
I believe so.

266
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,670
While Mr. Shibata and the officers were searching for the corpse Ine claimed to witness,

267
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,310
I reckon the other Shinako hid down here with the body.

268
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,180
What in the world?

269
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,260
You say there are three Shinako's.

270
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,030
But if your claim is true,

271
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:55,420
then Ine will become a murderer.

272
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,470
Doc, you don't need to entertain these folk!

273
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,170
Uncovering the truth of Ms. Shinako's lie

274
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,010
may make other people suffer.

275
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,600
What am I to do?

276
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,360
Still...

277
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,360
All you can really do, is act based on what you believe is right.

278
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,490
I've had enough of this farce.

279
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,360
Unless you're telling me there's a hidden room in this manor?

280
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,180
No, of course there isn't.

281
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,590
Proof isn't something you search for after making a claim.

282
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,400
- Sir...
- It doesn't matter if there's no proof. They exist!

283
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,900
So this is where they stayed.

284
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,880
This is where the Shinako's spent their days, hiding away.

285
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,460
They spent close to two decades in this dark, cramped space?

286
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,260
The Shinako's lived their lives out in secrecy down here.

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,730
They exist.

288
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,890
The Shinako we met yesterday truly exists.

289
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,650
To simply deny her very existence, is...

290
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,740
You're lying, she exists.

291
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,220
What are you rambling about?

292
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,540
You be quiet.

293
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,330
You've spoken nothing but lies.

294
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,440
You pretend to be the Shinako we met yesterday,

295
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,510
when really, you are your own individual.

296
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,400
The Shinako we met yesterday is also her own individual.

297
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,590
So was the Shinako who passed away a month ago.

298
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,420
And so are you, wherever you were yesterday.

299
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,210
Do not deny your own existence.

300
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,690
Please, tell us the truth.

301
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,000
Where is the Shinako

302
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,930
- we met yesterday?
- I already said, there is no hidden room -

303
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,240
- What in the world?
- Kubo!

304
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,270
- There was.
- Doc?

305
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,700
But I refuse to believe there are two Shinako's.

306
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,390
Surely there must only be...

307
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,200
Mr. Iwai!

308
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,740
Ms. Shinako?

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,640
- Ms. Shinako!
- And then there were two.

310
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,460
Ms. Shinako?

311
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,010
The Shinako Mr. Iwai carried in

312
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,470
had lost all color to her face,

313
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,950
as if she were a doll herself.

314
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,780
She's only unconscious.

315
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,610
Thank goodness...

316
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,780
Shinako...

317
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,590
Please, save her.

318
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,670
At last...

319
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,220
She's spoken from the heart.

320
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,450
Hurry, take her to the car.

321
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,420
My clinic will not suffice.

322
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,200
- Take her to the Maruicho Hospital.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,530
Explain, what is going on?

324
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,550
Getting this girl care is our priority!

325
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,810
Ms. Shinako!

326
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,890
In any case...

327
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,390
You're the culprit, aren't you?

328
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,580
- You're coming with me to the -
- Officer, can we save it for later?

329
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,220
We may need a blood transfusion,

330
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,830
so she's coming with us.

331
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,230
You heard the doctor. Let's go.

332
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,750
Then I shall hear you out at the hospital.

333
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,380
- I'm coming with her.
- Why?

334
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,990
You don't exactly understand what's going on now, do you?

335
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,640
Please make haste.

336
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,240
Great work.

337
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,770
Did you just scoff at me?

338
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,870
Jeez, the youth these days.

339
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,020
[Maruicho Hospital]

340
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,300
You've missed a button there.

341
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,100
- Keep sharp, lad!
- Sorry, sir.

342
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,070
Right then.

343
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,960
You hid the fact that you were born as triplets.

344
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,640
And one month ago...

345
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,670
one of your sisters passed away, is that right?

346
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,990
Yes.

347
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:19,270
The other Shinako began to tell us her whole story.

348
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,310
One month ago,

349
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,750
the Shinako who ate from the doll's portion, died from poison.

350
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,060
Ms. Ine ended up walking in on her, collapsed.

351
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,180
I presume she had gone in to steal a doll.

352
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,950
She must have made a spare key without our knowledge.

353
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,950
But as a consequence, she witnessed the body.

354
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,570
Ms. Ine, she...

355
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,780
She poisoned the doll's portion.

356
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,120
We'll say a doll died instead.

357
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,570
Someone will be coming.

358
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,150
Knock over a doll,

359
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,050
we'll say Ms. Ine was simply confused.

360
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,780
We're allowing people in here?

361
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,270
The police may enter regardless.

362
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,010
Now hurry!

363
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,200
Thus, we knocked over a doll...

364
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,200
and carried the dead Shinako...

365
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,000
into our cavern together.

366
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,190
I stayed behind, hidden away,

367
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,340
while Shinako remained in the doll room.

368
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,060
We told all parties who came to investigate, that a doll had been knocked over instead.

369
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,680
- And then...
- Say.

370
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,800
Does that mean this dead body is still hidden within that cavern?

371
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,380
We buried Shinako that night,

372
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,280
atop the mountain.

373
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,730
Eureka! So you attempted to murder the other Shinako,

374
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,210
to become the one true successor of the Ayao's!

375
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,400
- No!
- No?

376
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,460
This morning...

377
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,460
Shinako said she wished to confess the truth to you all.

378
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,670
I've been pondering this since last night, but...

379
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,720
I believe we should tell them the truth.

380
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,900
Have you lost your mind?

381
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,330
I won't allow it.

382
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,380
We've only accepted this interview to ease the prying eyes.

383
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,690
Why would you think to tell the truth?

384
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,340
Yesterday night,

385
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,770
I had gone to inform our guests about breakfast tomorrow,

386
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,810
when I overheard them.

387
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,140
If she lied,

388
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:16,530
does that mean Ms. Shinako is hiding something?

389
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,940
I want to be an ally to Ms. Shinako.

390
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,190
She is struggling against these rumors, alone.

391
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,020
That Ms. Kanoko is like us.

392
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,550
She lives with a burden of her own.

393
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,140
I think she'll understand.

394
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,840
She would listen.

395
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,090
She can help us Shinako's.

396
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,780
Wait!

397
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,620
Why do we insist on masquerading as one individual?

398
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,980
Why did Shinako have to die?

399
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,690
Why aren't "we" allowed to exist?

400
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,570
I had never given these questions much thought, until now.

401
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,410
And yet...

402
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,930
I cannot answer a single one.

403
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,940
All you can really do, is act based on what you believe is right.

404
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,370
Based on what I believe...

405
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:35,030
I believe telling those people our whole story, is what's right.

406
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,450
No, you can't.

407
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,690
Why not?

408
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,080
You simply can't.

409
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,750
If we keep this up, we'll only remain oblivious to the truth.

410
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,390
No!

411
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,180
I thought I had to hide the truth.

412
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,850
I tried to carry her in my kimono,

413
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,290
in order to make sure you couldn't trace her body,

414
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,950
by the tracks her blood would leave.

415
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,510
But she was too heavy to lift alone.

416
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,970
And as I was pondering how to carry her down...

417
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,120
Ms. Shinako? Ms. Shinako!

418
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,860
- Someone had come.
- Are you there?

419
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,650
It's no use, she's not responding.

420
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,040
I'll go ask the housemaid for a key.

421
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,660
Let's find a way in.

422
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,950
I wanted to plead for help, to save Shinako.

423
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,930
I've got another favor to ask you, Miyabi.

424
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,430
Please pay for the glass.

425
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,510
But I just couldn't.

426
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,480
Ms. Shinako? This is Hanasaki.

427
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,320
I'll be coming in.

428
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,610
Ms. Shinako!

429
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,440
Ms. Shinako -

430
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,410
This is... a doll.

431
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,540
In any case, why are you both pretending to be one individual?

432
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,960
Why is it such a huge secret?

433
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,910
I do not know.

434
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,430
What?

435
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,340
- You don't even know?
- Oh, shut your trap.

436
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,430
Have you not been listening to the girl?

437
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:51,190
The Shinako's are telling the truth. They know nothing about this custom.

438
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,760
I was terrified.

439
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,730
My whole life, I have pretended to be one individual.

440
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,300
There was never a time I wasn't "Shinako".

441
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,980
If we suddenly stopped acting as one...

442
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,550
I felt as though everything would crumble away.

443
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,230
She could only live to protect this custom,

444
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,090
because it was all she has ever known.

445
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,130
Ms. Shinako.

446
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,890
I believe searching for your parents' relatives,

447
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,990
or your sitters and wet nurses,

448
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,310
would help us figure something out.

449
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,290
May I have your permission to look into it?

450
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,500
Please. I want to know the truth as well.

451
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,190
Thank you for your patience.

452
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,390
The doctor has finished bandaging her wounds.

453
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,460
She had quite the large gash,

454
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,120
but the wound was nothing deep.

455
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,990
We'll have her here a couple of days to be safe,

456
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,970
but she is in good health.

457
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,840
You must be relieved, Ms. Shinako.

458
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,320
Thank you, Doctor.

459
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,750
I've cracked the case!

460
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,270
Shinako Ayao, you're coming with me to the station.

461
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,010
As for you folks...

462
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,180
Before I forget, Ms. Shinako.

463
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,340
You know how Ms. Ine truly died, don't you?

464
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,650
How she "truly" died?

465
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,370
Ms. Ine's death was a suicide.

466
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,120
Right.

467
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,080
She can be certain it wasn't suicide, because she knows the truth.

468
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,000
You saw something from the forest

469
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,040
the day Ms. Ine died, did you not?

470
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,560
In a previous testimony, "Shinako" was supposed to be back at the manor,

471
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,900
so you couldn't confess what you saw.

472
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,940
But you can tell us now.

473
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,810
She didn't commit suicide?

474
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,950
- Then -
- Quiet.

475
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,330
On that fateful day...

476
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,800
I was hiding away in the cavern.

477
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,070
But eventually, I couldn't handle seeing Shinako lying dead,

478
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
so I stepped out into the forest.

479
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,700
That was when I heard Ms. Ine's voice.

480
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,240
Hand over the doll.

481
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,340
Please, I've had enough!

482
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,300
- I don't want to steal anymore!
- I said, hand it over.

483
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,950
If we don't return this,

484
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,450
something may happen to us.

485
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,980
Just let go!

486
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,130
Then she was murdered!

487
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,400
C-Can you describe that man?

488
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,220
Is he someone you know?

489
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,400
He was thin, and had a bit of a hunched back.

490
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,180
He also had long, unruly graying hair.

491
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,270
So our culprit must be an elderly chap.

492
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,970
No.

493
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,970
There's a person who fits that bill to a tee.

494
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,070
No, it can't be...

495
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,590
That must be Ine's elder brother.

496
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,980
- Apprehend the man, now!
- Yes, sir!

497
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,240
Damn...

498
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,970
Who was the fool who called this a suicide in the first place?

499
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,860
Say...

500
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,490
You're a three-time winner of "Best Police Chief in the Prefecture", are you not?

501
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,670
Yes, and what of it?

502
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,820
He's lying, isn't he?

503
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,200
He certainly is.

504
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,380
So? What's the truth?

505
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,160
I've been given the award twice.

506
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,230
A lie.

507
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,870
You've never received the award then.

508
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,700
No, ma'am.

509
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,180
A person had died. A person, had been killed.

510
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:07,920
This was the truth behind these so called "doll killings".

511
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,450
That was the last time I ever saw Ms. Shinako

512
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,650
carry herself in a doll-like manner.

513
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,570
[Murder of the Ayao Family's Housemaid - Suspect Apprehended: The culprit was the housemaid's elder brother]

514
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,260
I wonder, did we do the right thing?

515
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,180
I only wanted to help Ms. Shinako,

516
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,620
but things turned rather serious...

517
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,980
You really excel at going 'round in circles, Ms. Kanoko.

518
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,450
What do you mean?

519
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,440
You tend to overly empathize with our clients.

520
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,280
So whenever something goes wrong for them,

521
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,000
you blame it all on yourself.

522
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,860
If you've done what you believe is right,

523
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,030
then that's that.

524
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,570
What are you doing, you rascal?

525
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,920
- Heya.
- Miyabi!

526
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,610
Scoot over.

527
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,720
Perfect.

528
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,460
Here, souvenirs.

529
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,620
Persimmons!

530
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,380
Enjoy them together.

531
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,680
- All this...
- For us?

532
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,850
- Yup.
- We won't have to forage weeds for a while, Mr. Iwai!

533
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,250
- Yeah!
- Weeds?

534
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,960
- Yes!
- Yup.

535
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,640
You never change.

536
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,180
But I didn't come today to give you your share of persimmons.

537
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,920
Since I've finally gathered my various findings,

538
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,170
so I'm here to give you all a report.

539
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,270
As it turns out, Mrs. Ayao -

540
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,180
that is, Ms. Shinako's mother - was a twin.

541
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,470
She hailed from a village called Shirokobe,

542
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,540
which once believed twins were harbingers of disaster.

543
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:07,330
Whenever a twin was born, they used to kill one of them off.

544
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,660
I can't believe it.

545
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,340
That's absurd.

546
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,160
They don't follow this tradition now, do they?

547
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,690
No.

548
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,840
But deep-rooted beliefs aren't so quick to change,

549
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,950
even if the times leave them far behind.

550
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,740
If only one of you were born...

551
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:41,180
Those in the village looked upon Mrs. Ayao's mother with contempt, for giving birth to twins.

552
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,970
Eventually, her heart could not take the ridicule any longer.

553
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,440
Mrs. Ayao was forced to witness her mother and sister end their lives.

554
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,770
That was the start of it all.

555
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,000
I see...

556
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,450
I also returned to the Doll House, to inform the Shinako's of my findings.

557
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,630
They were able to return to the manor?

558
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:22,770
Well, they weren't completely let off scot-free.

559
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,730
But the officers understood their complex circumstances.

560
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,950
In any case, this sadness and fear was a deep thorn in Mrs. Ayao's heart.

561
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,080
So when she married her husband,

562
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,210
and discovered she bore more than one child,

563
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,440
the fear ate at her heart once more.

564
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,020
Mr. Ayao worried for his wife's spiraling mental state,

565
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,160
and her fear of killing her own child.

566
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,540
Thus, he used every bit of inheritance he had,

567
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,240
and moved his new family to this remote manor.

568
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,430
In order to keep the locals in the dark, the Ayao's called for a midwife from afar...

569
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,700
And eventually, the triplets were born.

570
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,340
In order to keep his wife stable,

571
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,830
Mr. Ayao fabricated a custom of "raising dolls",

572
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,800
and acted as though Shinako was their only daughter.

573
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,350
They hid the truth of these triplets from their kin, the locals,

574
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:56,150
and eventually their house servants as well.

575
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:06,530
The Ayao's raised "Shinako" as their only daughter.

576
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:17,030
After some time, even they forgot the real truth.

577
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,990
Only then, was Mrs. Ayao set free from her long suffering.

578
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,930
Yes, right there.

579
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,740
Ready?

580
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:48,130
So the Shinako's as individuals had been erased.

581
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,670
Your guess about this tradition memorializing a dead child

582
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,850
wasn't entirely off the mark, Miyabi.

583
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Mr. Ayao created the customs enacted within the Doll House

584
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:10,400
so his wife and three kids could live happily, without tragedy.

585
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,430
It was a lie he upheld, for his family's sake.

586
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,890
Whether something can be deemed a "good" or "bad" lie

587
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,930
will always depend on circumstance and perspective.

588
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:37,190
I really owe this case to your sleuthing skills, Soma.

589
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,380
You're welcome.

590
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:46,370
But what tipped you off about the false claim of Ms. Ine's suicide?

591
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,450
And how could you tell the Shinako we met within the doll room,

592
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:56,060
wasn't the one we met the day before?

593
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,310
That would be because of my ability.

594
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,030
Because...

595
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,400
Actually, I'm getting married tomorrow.

596
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,350
Just kidding!

597
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,920
Well, I won't press.

598
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,130
I wouldn't be able to squeeze it out of Soma anyway.

599
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,280
Say, what time is it right now?

600
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,420
Oh gosh, already?

601
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,000
I have to get this article written by tomorrow.

602
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,650
You'll still be writing the article after all?

603
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,840
Yes, but only because the Shinako's asked me to do so.

604
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,440
They said they don't want to pretend like these last two decades never happened.

605
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,690
Sure, it may invite more prying eyes,

606
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,350
and they might face other underlying struggles.

607
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:56,420
But I think it's important they stay true to themselves.

608
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,240
It's a blessing to be allowed that opportunity.

609
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,370
Mr. Iwai grants me that same opportunity.

610
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:10,380
He allows me to stay true to my powers, and self.

611
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,880
Sorry to be an absolute whirlwind.

612
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,710
Right, I'll give you two a copy as well.

613
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,060
Here you go.

614
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,630
See you both around!

615
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,030
Miyabi also fought against her well-off family,

616
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,920
to chase her true calling as a journalist. She speaks from experience.

617
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,550
One more thing!

618
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:44,390
I take everything back about you not needing an assistant.

619
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,920
Good luck solving cases out there, you two.

620
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,430
Bye now!

621
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:12,940
The picture Ms. Miyabi took of the Shinako's upon her second visit

622
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:19,050
no longer dressed like the false dolls they used to be.

623
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,950
[To be continued]

624
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,010
Watch it, kid!

625
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,290
My pain flew right away.

626
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,300
How very suspicious.
[The secret hidden within a beautiful pocket mirror]

627
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,470
- Does this look familiar to you?
- Oh, hey!

628
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,060
- A cold?
- Please.

629
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,450
- Don't run...
- Mr. Soma!

630
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,590
There goes all the pain.

631
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,090
You cannot deceive this detective.
[The Girls Detective Club are on the case?]

632
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,150
Now resign to your fate.
[The Girls Detective Club are on the case?]

633
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,090
I don't want to hurt people.
[The Girls Detective Club are on the case?]

634
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,350
We are the Girls Detective Club.

635
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,830
- Say, Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes, sir?

636
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,260
If we keep the cat as a hostage, we could demand ransom money.

637
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,360
If you do, I'm telling Mr. Hanasaki.

638
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,740
- That way!
- That way?

639
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,040
Did I miss a spot?

640
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,510
Are you alright, Ms. Chiyo?

641
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,030
Farewell, miss.
