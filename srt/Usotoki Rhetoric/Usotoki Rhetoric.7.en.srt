00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,900
Stand back, folks!

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,330
- Stand back!
- Excuse me.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,190
- Make way.
- Unbelievable...

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,920
There's been a murder.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,980
Police only pass this point on.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,460
Now stand back, people.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,190
Stand back!

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,820
Good morning.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,110
The one murdered was the old man of the Tsuruya family.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,820
An intruder broke their way in,

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,140
after the Tsuruya's housemaid left the place for the night.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,330
So this was the result of a burglary.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,720
What a tragedy.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,560
Dear?

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,860
Dear!

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,350
Ma'am, please.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,030
- Stand back.
- Excuse me.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,170
- You can't cross this way, sir.
- What?

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,510
There's been a murder.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,230
The elderly man here was killed.

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,180
- How terrifying...
- My gods...

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,510
Go take the long route, lad.

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,930
And folks, head on home.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,900
But that means I have to pass by that manor...

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,720
- Mr. Hanasaki.
- Yes?

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,070
We found a witness who saw a suspicious individual.

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,970
- Mr. Tsuruya!
- Stand back, lad.

28
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,870
He says he's a university student who was staying in a separate room they had out back.

29
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,950
If only I had gone to check,

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,610
as soon as I had a bad feeling...

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,080
Pardon me, but is it true you saw a suspicious individual?

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,690
Yes, sir. I was on my way home,

33
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,610
when I passed him in front of the Tsuruya residence.

34
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,130
He held a dirty bag, and wore ragged pants as well.

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,310
I'm certain he was up to no good.

36
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,400
I see.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,680
- Mr. Tsuruya!
- Collect yourself, please.

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,900
Mr. Tsuruya!

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,240
I'm home.

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,210
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back!

41
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,360
Taro? What brings you here?

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,950
Mom told me to come visit.

43
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,610
The store was getting busy, so she asked us to keep him company.

44
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,420
We're drawing!

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,600
That's nice.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,970
Are those...

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Hot-water bottles!

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,930
From the landlady. She said she had no use for them anymore.

49
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,930
Really?

50
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,960
And one more gift.

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,760
- For me?
- Yup.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,100
Now we can ride out the winter chill.

53
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,290
Most certainly.

54
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,620
We won't have to freeze to the bone!

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,230
Yes, sir!

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,470
Did you catch a cold?

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,380
Are you okay, Taro?

58
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,330
- I'm fine.
- Really?

59
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,290
But it sure is cold...

60
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,210
What're you drawing, Taro?

61
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,400
It's a secret!

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,190
We're going to try and guess what we each drew.

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,110
Ta-da! Who's this?

64
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,770
Are those your parents?

65
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,880
- Yup!
- You're a real artist.

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,130
Let me get a closer look.

67
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,690
My turn.

68
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,780
This one is Pops, and that is the Ma'am, right?

69
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,170
It's like I'm looking at a photo.

70
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,420

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,270
Nope.

74
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,420
The correct answer is...

75
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,700
Mr. Iwai!

76
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,660
- This is me?
- Yes, sir!

77
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,180
How?

78
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,670
"How"?

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,110

[Usotoki Rhetoric]
[Episode 7]

82
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,670
This mushroom rice is delicious!

83
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,340
This meatball soup is also delish, Ms. Kanoko.

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,140
Ain't it?

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,540
I can't believe we're allowed to eat such delicious food every day.

86
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,160
We're truly blessed, Mr. Iwai.

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
Eat till you're full, Kanoko.

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,340
And don't worry, I've placed your bill on Mr. Iwai's growing tab.

89
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,960
- Welcome.
- Hello there.

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,460
Come on in.

91
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,710
What'll it be today?

92
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,970
- I'll have what they're having.
- Coming right up.

93
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,640
'Sup.

94
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,450
- Yeah.
- You look as gaunt as ever.

95
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,670
And you seem as aloof as ever.

96
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,350
A case giving you trouble?

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,480
We're currently investigating a murder that occurred two nights ago.

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,820
A murder?

99
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,830
Indeed. The retired Mr. Tsuruya was killed in his home on 33rd Street.

100
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,410
We're certain a burglar is behind this,

101
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,210
as most of his valuables are gone.

102
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,530
However, we have yet to uncover a suspect.

103
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,710
What a horrifying incident...

104
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,930
Order up.

105
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,380
Thank you, sir.

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,170
I shall enjoy this meal.

107
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,710
You said 33rd Street. Ain't that behind the Haunted Manor?

108
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,480
- Yes.
- Haunted Manor?

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,210
Pops, give me seconds of that mushroom rice.

110
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,490
And this meatball soup, too.

111
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,290
I've got no seconds for you.

112
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,310
Listen here, Mr. Iwai.

113
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,690
I made all this nutritious food today 'cause Taro was feverish this morning.

114
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,570
- One portion's all you get.
- You said to eat my fill.

115
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,200
And who do you think harvested these mushrooms? Me.

116
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,580
Kanoko picked most of them, did she not?

117
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,540
I'd reckon you simply sat and watched.

118
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,260
Exactly.

119
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,580
- How's Taro?
- He slept after taking the medicine from the clinic.

120
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,950
So, what is this about a haunted manor?

121
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,810
There's a manor 'round these parts that's said to be haunted by a ghost.

122
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,100
A murder took place there a decade ago.

123
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,550
Hold on, you said two nights ago... on November 18th?

124
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,430
Yes.

125
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,830
That's the same day.

126
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,140
This killing also took place on November 18th, ten years ago.

127
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,560
It's just a coincidence.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,900
Do you know the story?

129
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,020
Yes, somewhat.

130
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,510
A painter's wife was murdered there, I believe?

131
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,330
Right. They say the culprit was her husband, Gahaku Adachi.

132
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,310
But the man's been missing ever since his wife was found dead.

133
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,070
Missing...

134
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,790
They used to both be regulars of ours.

135
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,480
Mr. Adachi used to compliment every meal he ate here.

136
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,200
He was a good lad, that one.

137
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,120
I still can't believe he'd murder his wife.

138
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,350
He really didn't look like the sorta fella who'd do such a thing.

139
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,620
Does that mean the ghost haunting this manor... is his wife?

140
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,120

- Oh my!
- What now?

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,870
I've forgotten my shawl as well, at the clinic.

150
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,210

But if I head out now...

154
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,740
Well, it's alright. I have another shawl I prefer anyway.

155
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,900
Would you like me to get it for you?

156
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,610
Oh, I could never...

- Of course. I'll make sure it's an extra large one.

I'm not lying, I swear!

181
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,940
Not that I really care, but how about it?

182
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,050
He is indeed not lying.

183
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,900
I see.

184
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,460
This isn't a show, people. Leave us!

185
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,850
Mr. Detective.

186
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,520
What?

187
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,080
A detective?

188
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm terribly sorry for that pathetic sight.

189
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,010
My name is Kanji Kirino.

190
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,240
I work as an illustrator for journals and advertisements.

191
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,940
An illustrator, I see.

192
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,130
I can't believe you'd ask the Detective to entertain your ridiculous case.

193
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,320
- Well...
- If you just tell me the truth, we would be done here.

194
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,840
But I am telling the truth!

195
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,500
Sir, I saw a ghost.

196
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,470
- A ghost?
- Yes.

197
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,370
More ghost stories...

198
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,140
Ms. Kanoko?

199
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,380
He doesn't lie.

200
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,650
Here, I was given some dorayaki*
[T/N: two pancake-like patties, usually filled with red bean paste]

201
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,990
if you all would like some.
[T/N: two pancake-like patties, usually filled with red bean paste]

202
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,280
- Dorayaki -
- I shall hear you out.

203
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,090
Tell me exactly what happened, in detail please.

204
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,700
Two nights ago, I was running late to arrangements I had made

205
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,990
at the movie theatre.

206
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,740
Unfortunately, the road there happened to be blocked

207
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,930
because of a murder of sorts.

208
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,070
Would that be by the Tsuruya's place?

209
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,410
Yes, and because the entirety of 33rd Street was closed,

210
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,410
I took a detour along 30th Street.

211
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,960
30th Street...

212
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,940
Which meant I had no choice but to pass by the Haunted Manor.

213
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,090
I knew it...

214
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,710
On any other day, I'd be scared out of my wits to even walk by it.

215
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,680
But with the roads, I had no choice.

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
And then?

217
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
As I walked past the manor,

218
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,210
a strong wind suddenly picked up,

219
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,850
rolling a bucket onto my path.

220
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,060
That was when I felt like someone was staring at me.

221
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,380
So I turned my gaze up to the second floor,

222
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,730
only to see a woman's face in the window.

223
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,070
Was that the ghost?

224
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,860
Yes, I'm absolutely certain.

225
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,550
She was staring at me as she hung herself.

226
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,470
I even drew a portrait. Here.

227
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,700
Preposterous.

228
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,070
Your story won't trick me.

229
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,940
It's no story. Help me out, Mr. Detective!

230
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,130
You want me to investigate this ghost -

231
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,600
No, the woman. I want you to figure out what's her deal.

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Right, so the ghost?

233
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,690
I have no clue who this woman is.

234
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,620
But she swears she knows me!

235
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,740
I'll explain.

236
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,470
You have these poor folks lost.

237
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,190
Two nights ago, we had plans to watch a movie together.

238
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,700
Kanji wouldn't show even as the movie began.

239
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,080
However, a woman I had no recollection of came instead.

240
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,050
A woman...

241
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,120
This is you, isn't it?

242
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,750
[K.K.]

243
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,870
I'm searching for the man who drew this portrait.

244
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,670
Where is he?

245
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,890
We had to part yesterday due to... reasons.

246
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,560
But I wish to see him again.

247
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
According to her story,

248
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,370
Kanji left the portrait behind at her place the day before.

249
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,740
He had supposedly left our movie tickets there as well.

250
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,680
This woman used those things to trace her way to me.

251
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,040
She said although she forgot to ask Kanji's name,

252
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,010
the night they spent together was one she never would.

253
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,540
Where is he?

254
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,060
I don't know.

255
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,820
He's just another customer at my cafe.

256
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,730
One whose name I don't bother with.

257
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,310
Not only did he leave me to wait,

258
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,500
but I heard nothing from him afterwards.

259
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,180
I was beyond myself with anger,

260
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,280
when I got word he was sent to the hospital just earlier.

261
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,820
I was running in a panic from the ghost, when I fell into a ditch.

262
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,500
- Hence, the broken leg.
- What "ghost"?

263
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,150
Come up with a more convincing lie, you cheater.

264
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm not lying!

265
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,470
That woman had a portrait you drew.

266
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,980
It was meant to be a gift for you.

267
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,090
I must've dropped it when I saw the ghost -

268
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,100
Oh really now?

269
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,160
What an odd story indeed.

270
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm terribly sorry to have wasted your time, Mr. Detective.

271
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,890
I suppose it was never my place to complain, seeing as we're not lovers and all.

272
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,470
Lily!

273
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,130
I've grown tired of "playing" lovers with you, Kanji.

274
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,790
If you ever thought I'd take you seriously, that was your mistake.

275
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,690
Ms. Lily!

276
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,940
I don't think Mr. Kanji was lying.

277
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,490
Could I ask that you believe his words?

278
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,080
"You're special."

279
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,650
"I mean it. Believe me."

280
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,080
That's what all our customers say.

281
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,850
When you "play" lovers in a store like ours,

282
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,660
you fall prey to their lies, and take their sweet words to heart.

283
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,260
But because it was only ever make believe,

284
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,520
the illusion often breaks outside our bubble, in the real world.

285
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,460
Even so, Mr. Kanji...

286
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,960
I'm glad I didn't hire you back then.

287
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,760
You're far too earnest to work as a waitress.

288
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,110
You'd fall to danger, and fast.

289
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,030
Ms. Lily...

290
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,600
See you around.

291
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,400
No matter how much I insist he's telling the truth,

292
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,880
my words aren't convincing in the slightest,

293
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,970
especially given Ms. Lily's past experiences.

294
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,950
Of course.

295
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,340
Of course she wouldn't take me seriously.

296
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,310
I'm no one special.

297
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,960
Let's head on back.

298
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,580
- We're back.
- Welcome back, dear.

299
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,570
- Oh, thank you so much!
- Of course.

300
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,600
You've got impeccable timing. Dinner's just about ready.

301
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,570
Where is Mr. Iwai?

302
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,800
Huh?

303
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr. Iwai?

304
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,120
Sir?

305
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,240
Come on, let's go.

306
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,830
Go, where?

307
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,850
To find us a ghost.

308
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,530
A ghost... Wait, what?

309
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,270
You're worried about Ms. Lily and Mr. Kanji, aren't you?

310
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,090
Well, I mean... sir?

311
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,450
- Great timing.
- Huh?

312
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,940
Come with us.

313
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,940
- Huh?
- Mr. Iwai?

314
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,310
Mr. Kanji saw this ghost... in that window there.

315
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,760
His sketch is so realistic, it's terrifying.

316
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,860
Not locked? Great.

317
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,360
Well? Come on.

318
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,030
The entrance was rusty, and left unlocked.

319
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,210
Um, sir?

320
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,210
I bet the inside of the manor is no better.

321
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,510
Brr, it's freezing.

322
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,140
What exactly are we doing here?

323
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,380
- Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes, sir?

324
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,800
Mr. Kanji saw a ghost the same night this mystery lady visited Ms. Lily.

325
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,270
Don't you think these incidents may be related?

326
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,090
A ghost?

327
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,940
Sir, are you saying this lady was the ghost?

328
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,110
A ghost?

329
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,880
I have no time to hunt ghosts.

330
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,510
Now if you'll excuse me...

331
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
You might find a clue in here.

332
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,550
A clue to the murder, that is.

333
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,550
The murder?

334
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,150
Are you saying this is related to Mr. Tsuruya's -

335
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,850
The identity of this mystery woman lies within our Haunted Manor, I'm sure of it.

336
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,150
The... Haunted Manor.

337
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,090
- H-Hey.
- Mr. Iwai!

338
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,690
A murder truly occurred within this manor ten years ago, yes?

339
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,340
Indeed. Mrs. Adachi was found stabbed in the chest, and dead.

340
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,830
Their housemaid was the one who discovered the body,

341
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,940
alongside a bloodied painting knife.

342
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,170
A knife?

343
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,590
It's a tool used for oil painting.

344
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,280
You use it to scoop the paint and press it into the canvas,

345
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,370
or to layer it onto the canvas.

346
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,480
Gahaku Adachi became the prime suspect of this case, as he went missing soon afterwards.

347
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,690
Although a search was sent to police around the nation,

348
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,990
he has yet to be found and arrested.

349
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:28,380
Then did Mr. Kanji see the ghost of Mr. Adachi's deceased wife?

350
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,960
- A ghost?
- No, that'd be odd.

351
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,010
- Why?
- This ghost was seen hanging herself,

352
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,330
while Mrs. Adachi was stabbed to death.

353
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,110
- Ghost?
- Do ghosts tend to stay true to those sorts of things?

354
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,430
- It's how she died.
- I don't know.

355
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,810
But I also don't see why she would bother hanging herself.

356
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,310
Soma!

357
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,050
We're looking for clues regarding Mr. Tsuruya's murder.

358
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,300
What is all this ghost talk you've been talking about?

359
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,740
Mr. Tsuruya?

360
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,550
You said we'd find clues of the murder here!

361
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,790
Right, from the one ten years ago.

362
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,690
I don't give a damn about the case you're investigating.

363
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,560
Then why am I here?

364
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,070
Because ordinary citizens like us shouldn't be breaking and entering.

365
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,390
Don't rope me into your trespassing escapades!

366
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,260
- S-Sir!
- What is it, Ms. Urabe?

367
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,450
Kaoru, take a closer look.

368
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,480
These are...

369
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,280
Portraits of Mrs. Adachi?

370
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,130
But her face has been...

371
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,490
Did someone come and deface these works?

372
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,970
I think these have been vandalized since the murder.

373
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,360
Since back then?

374
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,370
If these paintings were torn into at the crime scene,

375
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,100
it'd give the police another reason to believe Gahaku Adachi was guilty.

376
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,660
I see.

377
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,700
On to the supposed ghost room then. Come on.

378
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,030
- Sir!
- I'm going home!

379
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,560
H-Hey, I'm heading home.

380
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,390
- Wait.
- I swear...

381
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,270
- Quiet.
- What?

382
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,260
Why are we -

383
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,300
- Shh...
- Let me out...

384
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,950
That's strange.

385
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,940
- Soma!
- The ghost is a woman, right?

386
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,430
But this voice... is clearly a man.

387
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,510
Help me...

388
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,070
A man?

389
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,070
I have no business entertaining ghosts.

390
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,660
- What if this was a person?
- Help me...

391
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,910
- A person?
- This man sounds in pain, too.

392
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,110
Help me...

393
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,940
Let me out of here...

394
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,160
We're actually going up?

395
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,290
- Let me out...
- Are you not scared?

396
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,160
If this truly is a living, breathing human, I cannot ignore them.

397
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,990
Let me out of here...

398
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:26,400
Help me...

399
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,740
Is this...

400
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,060
It's the room Mr. Kanji claims he saw a ghost in.

401
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,010
"Murderer"...

402
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,640
Now this looks like someone's vandalism.

403
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,390
Enough of that. I can't hear the voice anymore.

404
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,270
But we all heard it going up the stairs.

405
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,300
Soma, what's the trick here?

406
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,490
If we take Mr. Kanji's ghost portrait as the truth...

407
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,030
Why did it look to him like she was hanging herself?

408
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,800
Sir?

409
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,420
Kaoru, hold this.

410
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,810
Sure.

411
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,610
Mr. Kanji claimed the woman was hanging herself,

412
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,040
but it doesn't look like she is in this portrait, no?

413
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,340
I suppose not.

414
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,840
Ms. Kanoko, the light.

415
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,470
Yes, sir.

416
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,550
Kaoru.

417
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,050
Right.

418
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:51,000
So this is how the ghost was observing Mr. Kanji.

419
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,240
From Mr. Kanji's perspective, it would look like she was about to hang herself.

420
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,680
I see now.

421
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,610
But why did this ghost... this woman,

422
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,030
climb up on a chair?

423
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,250
Help, help me...

424
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,920
Over there...

425
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,890
Kaoru, look! Look carefully!

426
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,310
At what? What?

427
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,100
So you're the man who murdered Mr. Tsuruya.

428
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,350
The corpse inside was of Gahaku Adachi.

429
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,980
He's long been mummified though.

430
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,770
Mummified...

431
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,290
Although I must investigate the corpse inside...

432
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,500
It's only been two days?

433
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,650
I'm certain you won't be running off with wounds like those.

434
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,290
Now fess up, and tell us everything.

435
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,810
Fine.

436
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,070
I'm on a straight shot path for hell anyway.

437
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:28,030
I'll drag that damned woman down with me.

438
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,050
Two nights ago,

439
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,130
after I stabbed the old man,

440
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,630
I thought I'd hide someplace, and lay low.

441
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,990
It was as I was running,

442
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,680
that I found this manor.

443
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,600
I thought it was the perfect spot to hideout.

444
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,180
But as I was heading inside,

445
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,260
I ran into a woman.

446
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,480
D-Don't scream. If you do, I'll kill you.

447
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,410
The woman said she knew a great place to hide,

448
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,060
and led me to this room.

449
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,110
What in the...

450
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,060
Play nice with Mr. Adachi.

451
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,480
Ouch...

452
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:03,100
Thankfully, it seems she missed all my vitals.

453
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,960
But the hunger and cold was unbearable.

454
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,920
I'd assume I lost consciousness soon afterwards.

455
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,420
And you came to, because of our voices.

456
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,980
But who exactly is this woman?

457
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,740
Her.

458
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,660
Move.

459
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,760
That's the vixen who stabbed me.

460
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,420
A woman's portrait?

461
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,530
Could it be Mrs. Adachi?

462
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,460
What? Mrs. Adachi stabbed this man?

463
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,450
No. The missus most certainly died ten years ago.

464
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,960
Then that means...

465
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,250
The person who trapped this man...

466
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,480
was the ghost of Mrs. Adachi?

467
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,950
- Her ghost?
- No, this was nothing supernatural.

468
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,270
This woman is most likely a model Gahaku Adachi hired.

469
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,380
This manor did have all the answers we needed.

470
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,260
- All of them?
- Every last one.

471
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,180
This woman is the culprit from ten years ago.

472
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,360
She's the ghost Mr. Kanji saw.

473
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,510
She's the woman who stabbed, and trapped this man.

474
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,530
She's the mystery woman who approached Ms. Lily.

475
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,430
She's the answer to everything.

476
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,090
I don't know who she is, or what her deal may be,

477
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,200
but this woman is searching for Mr. Kanji.

478
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,400
And the only information Ms. Lily told her, was...

479
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,260
- We meet again.
- Yes, indeed.

480
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,760
Mr. Hanasaki. This woman is the individual who approached me by the theatre.

481
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,130
I'm with the police.

482
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,030
We would like to ask you a few questions.

483
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,160
Here you go.

484
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,540
Thank you.

485
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,650
The woman we apprehended was indeed a model hired by Gahaku Adachi.

486
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,890
I see.

487
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,250
It seems she had a one-sided affection for the painter.

488
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:45,750
I had frequented Mr. Adachi's home, because I wanted him to paint many portraits of me.

489
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,850
But one day, he said I didn't need to visit anymore.

490
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,040
Gahaku insisted he wished to paint more portraits of his wife,

491
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,030
and in a fit of anger at his rejection,

492
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,690
she murdered Gahaku.

493
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,140
The woman then ran into his wife upon trying to escape,

494
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,220
and proceeded to also kill Mrs. Adachi out of resentment.

495
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,390
In order to pin the blame of his wife's murder on Gahaku himself,

496
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,880
the woman hid Gahaku's body in that hidden room.

497
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,320
She was also the one who tore apart the portraits of Mrs. Adachi.

498
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,010
I see.

499
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,570
As for how she discovered the hidden room, it seems she saw Gahaku enter it whilst spying on him.

500
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,620
So why had she come to visit Tsukumoyacho ten years later?

501
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,270
That's the strangest part.

502
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,850
Three years after the incident,

503
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,240
this woman pined to see Gahaku's corpse,

504
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,710
and visited the manor once more.

505
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,520
You see, Mr. Adachi wasn't dead at all.

506
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,950
"Wasn't dead"?

507
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,550
Did you not end his life yourself?

508
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,090
Mr. Adachi is alive.

509
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:59,040
If he were truly dead, he would be all bones, no?

510
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,260
Ah, well...

511
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,370
Mr. Adachi.

512
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,600
I've missed you so.

513
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,730
Say, would you paint another portrait of me?

514
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,820
After that visit, Mr. Adachi began to frequent my dreams.

515
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,110
I was happy to see him every time.

516
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,540
But I never wanted to leave him lonely.

517
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,730
So every time he appeared in my dreams, I went to visit him.

518
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,950
She went to go visit a mummy...

519
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,010
It was on one such visit that the woman bumped into the burglar.

520
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,930
D-Don't scream.

521
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,680
If you do, I'll kill you.

522
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,120
You smell of blood.

523
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,680
You've killed a man.

524
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,750
Say what?

525
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,670
Do not fret.

526
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,280
I know a great place you can hide.

527
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,370
Play nice with Mr. Adachi.

528
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,680
I placed that man in the room with Mr. Adachi.

529
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,240
I thought Mr. Adachi could use the company.

530
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,350
You've seen us.

531
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,560
A man saw where Mr. Adachi was being kept.

532
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,050
Which is why...

533
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,780
She was searching for Mr. Kanji. To silence him.

534
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,680
That is the truth of this incident.

535
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,550
This was no ghost.

536
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,330
It was all the doings of one woman.

537
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,340
There was never a ghost.

538
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,740
If anything, living, breathing humans are far more terrifying.

539
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,840
I suppose so.

540
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,140
Although I have more to discuss with the woman this afternoon,

541
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,710
I am relieved these incidents have come to a case closed.

542
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,740
Soma.

543
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,910
Thank you.

544

[Hiroike Clinic]

545
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,260
These are gifts I got, but help yourselves.

546
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,560
Thank you.

547
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,920
Thank you very much.

548
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,100
Then I shall take one.

549
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,610
Still, to think an incident from ten years ago was involved...

550
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,130
Quite a shock, isn't it?

551
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,230
I didn't realize the immediate danger I was in.

552
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,450
Thank you, really.

553
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,140
I owe my life to you both.

554
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,480
You give us too much credit.

555
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,170
This really does look like her.

556
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,920
The police gave it back to me.

557
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,230
It's a real shame I can't give this to the subject herself though.

558
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,540
She pretty clearly rejected me, after all.

559
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,360
But I'm sure Ms. Lily also...

560
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,710
Ms. Kanoko.

561
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,690
Ms. Lily!

562
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,970
This bouquet...

563
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,320
It's from you, yes?

564
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,410
You should go speak to Mr. Kanji -

565
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,760
And how am I supposed to do that?

566
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,930
After everything I said to him... how?

567
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,960
Before, my words didn't sound convincing in the slightest.

568
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,970
But now, the truth Mr. Iwai uncovered

569
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,830
will give my words the strength they need.

570
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,510
Mr. Kanji was never lying.

571
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:46,760
Ms. Lily. Please give him your answer.

572
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,730
Lily...

573
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,600
Ouch!

574
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,240
I'm an absolute fool.

575
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,010
I'm so sorry, Kanji.

576
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,240
Kanji, I'm so sorry!

577
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,810
I'm so, so sorry.

578
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,330
Lily...

579
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,360
- Lily!
- I'm so sorry...

580
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,270
- I'm sorry.
- Let's not get in their way.

581
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,110
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes, sir.

582
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,020
It's okay.

583
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,270
The flowers...

584
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,380
Those two won't be needing flowers.

585
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,280
I suppose not.

586
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,790
Let's go.

587
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,230
Huh?

588
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,860
Open up.

589
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,060
This place isn't so scary when the sun is up, is it?

590
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,140
I guess so...

591
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,000
Have you caught a cold?

592
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,750
You too?

593
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,530
It seems like it.

594
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,190
I'm freezing. Let's head back.

595
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,590
Yes, let's.

596
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,000
I was told this meeting would be our last.

597
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,300
What?

598
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:39,550
In my dream, he said this would be our last.

599
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,190
So I came this time to press Mr. Adachi for answers.

600
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,130
You came to press the mummified Gahaku Adachi, for answers.

601
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,190
What exactly were you going to ask him?

602
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,870
"Are you going to push me away once more?"

603
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,770
"Even though your wife is long gone?"

604
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,650
I see.

605
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,140
But...

606
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,270
was that voice truly his?

607
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,530
Pardon?

608
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,350
After all...

609
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,450
The last time we spoke...

610
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,130
Mr. Adachi looked...

611
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,140
happy.

612
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,950
Mr. Iwai.

613
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,080
Kanoko.

614
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,270
You two alright?

615
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,230
We hear you both caught a cold.

616
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,930
We're getting by.

617
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,440
Here, scoot on over.

618
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,920
I brought some mushroom and meatball hot pot for you two.

619
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,120
I'll be borrowing this.

620
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,120
There.

621
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,420
It's got plenty of green onions, tofu, glass noodles,

622
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,430
and of course, meat balls.

623
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,660
You'll perk right back up with this.

624
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,940
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Pops.

625
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,470
Don't mention it. Take it as a gift of gratitude as well.

626
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,610
Of gratitude?

627
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,660
Mr. Adachi was truly a good man.

628
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,400
He loved our food, and that's reason enough.

629
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,040
But more importantly, he wasn't the sort of chap to kill his wife.

630
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,140
You proved the man's innocence, right?

631
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,430
What I'm trying to say is... Thanks, Mr. Iwai.

632
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,100
Any time.

633
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,530
To think he was all alone in that manor,

634
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,300
for a decade past his death...

635
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,070
It's a sad tale, really.

636
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,090
Speaking of, that hot pot was a favorite of the Adachi's.

637
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,490
I brought Mr. Adachi's favorite yam sauce as well.

638
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,790
Eat this up,

639
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,000
and get better, alright?

640
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,900
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

641
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,580
- See you around.
- Take care now.

642
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,840
This hot pot sure is delicious.

643
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,490
I wish my nose wasn't stuffed so I could savor this flavor...

644
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,430
At any rate,

645
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,750
you resolved two incidents at once, Mr. Iwai.

646
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,310
I should've expected nothing less.

647
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,400
The cold is too bad though.

648
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,220
It turns out there was no ghost.

649
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,780
This was all the doing of living persons.

650
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,740
I wonder if that really is the case.

651
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,560
Huh?

652
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,950
Ten years after this unsolved incident took place,

653
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,590
another killing happened on the same day, in the same town as the first.

654
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,640
What a coincidence.

655
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,410
The woman who caused the incident ten years ago, decides to revisit the manor,

656
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,600
and coincidentally bumps into the culprit of this second killing.

657
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,880
Coincidentally...

658
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,430
The woman then hides this killer away

659
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,960
by opening a hidden room in the manor, when...

660
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,980
Mr. Kanji coincidentally walks by the manor,

661
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,070
- and coincidentally witnesses her in the act.
- Right.

662
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,040
Aren't they starting to stack up?

663
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,630
There are quite a few coincidences, yes.

664
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,720
We coincidentally visit the clinic,

665
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,010
only to coincidentally take on a case involving that woman.

666
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,790
Mr. Kanji is an illustrator...

667
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,520
While Mr. Adachi was a painter.

668
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,790
Are these mere coincidences? Or...

669
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,450
It's sort of cold.

670
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,430
I'm starting to get chills.

671
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,180
It's almost as if...

672
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,450
someone's will was pulling the strings.

673
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,280
Someone? Who?

674
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,540
- Ms. Kanoko, go. Go!
- S-Sir?

675
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,830
W-Why? What?

676
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,510
But there isn't anyone...

677
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,310
I'm cold. Even colder than before.

678
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,400
Sir, what should we do?

679
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,160
Let's eat this hot pot clean.

680
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,790
Pops made it with his whole heart, after all.

681
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,730
A sound idea, sir.

682
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,700
I'm freezing...

683
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,190
[To be continued]

00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,790
You squash head!
[A rambunctious rumble involving catered meals?]

685
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,610
Says you, you headband hooligan!
[A rambunctious rumble involving catered meals?]

686
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,320
You've just crossed the damn line!

687
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,980
- Mr. Iwai?
- You only know doubt.

688
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,040
I'm telling the Madam.
[Who is the liar?]

689
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,330
Are you two...
[Who is the liar?]

690
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,750
I can't hear the lies.
[Her mysterious power has disappeared?]

691
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,140
Dad isn't lying, is he?
[Her mysterious power has disappeared?]

692
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,650
You just believe in your Pops, alright?
[Her mysterious power has disappeared?]

693
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,320
That woman was most likely...

694
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,680
Swindling you.

695
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,970
I'm not paying for meals I didn't order!

696
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,250
Enough!

697
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,900
Make way!

698
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:37,250
Folks like us who can't detect lies are actually quite resilient.
