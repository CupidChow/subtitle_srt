I can't hear the lies.

00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,480
- Good morning.
- Hello there!

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,750
Shopping?

4
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,910
Yes. I plan on making sukiyaki for dinner tonight.

5
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,690
- My! So am I.
- She's... not lying?

6
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,990
You're a lucky man, my good sir.

7
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,400
Buy this elsewhere, and it would've cost you twice as much.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,080
- Really?
- I'd never lie.

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,920
Why?

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,350
Miss.

11
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,490
Your knot there is coming undone.

12
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,230
- Let me fix it for you.
- I'm scared.

13
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,050
- Now, come this way.
- I'm so scared.

14
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm fine, thank you -

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,300
You see, I'm passing these flyers out around town.

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,030
Could I ask for your assistance in doing so, with Soma in tow?

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,280
Mr. Iwai is currently out picking weeds.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,260
If you give him a moment, he should return soon.

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,390
He's out doing manual labor?

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,700
I had assumed he would be lazing around, but alas.

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,390
Thank you.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,350
Now then.

24
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,660
I'd like to ask you both to pass these out around the neighborhood.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,660
You've become a familiar face to the folks around these parts after all.

26

- Thank you.

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,910
You made these yourself, Mr. Hanasaki?

29
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,300
Indeed. The other day, I was visiting Tsukumoya Station

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,550
as a part of my year end rounds.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,760
I was advising the conductors to tighten security,

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,370
when I ran into a lady who had her purse stolen.

33
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,540
You're free to go for the night.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,760
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, sir.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,360
Could I please ask for your help?

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,940
Sorry ma'am, I'm in a hurry.

37
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,940
Is something the matter, ma'am?

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,990
Oh, well...

39
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,320

and I can no longer afford the train fare.

She said her daughter, who had married far away, was soon to give birth.

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,450
Sir, could you perhaps lend me the money for a one way trip?

As such, I lent her the money she needed for her ticket.

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,080
Mr. Hanasaki...

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,540
Yes?

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,220
That woman was most likely...

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,880
Swindling you.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,060
- Mr. Iwai.
- There you are.

50

That's the dictionary definition of a common swindler.

51

Don't make assumptions.

And don't interject as you please.

It's freezing, close the door.

59
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,490
She was freezing out there, all while holding a talisman wishing for a safe birth.

60
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,870
She asked for a mode of contact as well.

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,950
Did you ask for hers?

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,030
How ever shall I thank you?

63
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,410
Any last passengers?

64
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,760
I didn't. Her train was about to depart.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,030
So you played it cool.

66
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,540
You didn't even watch the lady get on the train.

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,220
Like I could help it.

68
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,720
Who do you think cleans up after your mess, every time you're swindled?

69
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,900
We don't know I've been swindled yet.

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,340
You only know doubt.

71
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,640
And I envy your naivety.

72
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,650
In any case, that is why I wish to raise awareness of the issue.

73
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,060
Don't use my assistant for your grunt work.

74
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,110
Then you help me out, you nonbeliever.

- For free?
- Mr. Iwai.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,830
- I'd never pay a man like you.
- I can -

77
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,320
Out with you.

78
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,730
Don't get us involved in your problems.

79
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,700
She said she would return the money.

80
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,850
- And I choose to believe her.
- Good bye.

What have these luxurious meals ever done wrong?

Truth be told, we made these to-order at Mr. Roppei's request,

126
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,170
but it seems there has been a mix-up in the amount.

We thought Mr. Roppei had ordered 23 servings,

128

But I don't have school today.

- Come again!
- Thank you, Ma'am.

- Mr. Roppei?
- Sorry to bother, may I?

160
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,300
- Sure thing.
- What do you want?

161
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,330
- Here, sit.
- Can I get a water?

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,640
- What's up?
- Here, have a sake instead.

- You, shut it.
- Get him a water.

164

I explained my situation to the Kurata's,

165
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,870
and told them they were my last hope.

166
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,610
How many servings can you make? I'll pay whatever.

167
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,650
Is that really your way of asking a favor?

168
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,920
But for an old friend, I can whip up at least 20 to 30 servings.

I owe you.

- A fountain pen? How classy.
- You think?

171
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,430
- Then could you make 13 servings?
- Sure thing.

00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,480
- Thank you.
- Of course.

173
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,040

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,310
Mr. Roppei is not lying.

176
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,000
I see.

177
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,240
Could you write exactly what you jotted down here for us?

178
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,600
I wrote this down with a fountain pen on the Kurata's notepad,

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,690
then handed the slip to Mrs. Kurata.

180
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,840
A fountain pen?

181
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,790
Sorry, I don't have it on me today.

182
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,000
Is it possible you only thought you wrote "13"?

183
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,170
I can't say for sure.

184
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
But Mrs. Kurata might've seen me write the order.

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,950
She was standing right next to me.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,740
Thank you for your time, Mr. Roppei.

187
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,370
- That's it?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,530
Mr. Roppei! Thank you for your time.

189
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,910
I'll pour some tea.

190
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,090
Thank you for your patience.

191
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,110
Could we speak to Mrs. Kurata next?

192
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,450
Huh?

193
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,960
- Me?
- Her?

194
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,420
Yes. We have a question to ask the Ma'am first.

195
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,030
Then of course.

196
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,950
Excuse me, you two.

197
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,740
Ma'am.

198
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,500
Mrs. Kurata.

199
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,180
Yes?

200
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,490
Did you witness Mr. Roppei write his order?

201
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,350
[Testimony 2: Proprietress of "Kurata Eatery", Yoshie]

202
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,640
I did, yes.
[Testimony 2: Proprietress of "Kurata Eatery", Yoshie]

203
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,630
I was standing right next to him.

204
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,020
But for an old friend, I can whip up at least 20 to 30 servings.

205
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,790
I owe you.

206
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,090
- A fountain pen? How classy.
- You think?

207
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,400
After Mr. Roppei finishing jotting down his order,

208
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,780
I took the note off his hands.

209
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,370
Were you able to see the number he wrote down?

210
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,780
Yes, he most definitely wrote "13 servings".

211
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,750
Could you write what he jotted down for us here, on this board?

212
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,420
Of course.

213
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,260
And yet, now it looks like it says...

214
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,900
"23 servings".
[23 servings - 13 servings]

215
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,250
What a conundrum...

216
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,380
Did you have other customers at the time?

217
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,650
Yes, two of our regulars.

218
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,400
But I made sure to keep the note tucked away, of course.

219
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,820
Why has this turned into an absolute hassle...

220
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,760
Do you still have this note?

221
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,310
Yes. I believe my husband has it.

222
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,250
Mrs. Kurata isn't lying either.

223
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,560
Which only leaves...

224
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,700
Then let's all return to Kurata together.

225
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,160
Thank you both.

226
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,870
Next, I want you to listen to Mr. Kurata's testimony while watching everyone's reactions. Got that?

227
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,270
Yes, sir.

228
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,440
Took you long enough.

229
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,750
Pops, we'll hear your testimony here.

230
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,170
- Have a seat.
- Huh?

231
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,120
What're you laughing at?

232
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,940
And keep your socks on.

233
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,440
- Alright, Pops. Tell us -
- He waltzed in while I was closing up shop.
[Testimony 3: Owner of Kurata Eatery, Tatsuzo]

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,970
Said something about needing catered meals,
[Testimony 3: Owner of Kurata Eatery, Tatsuzo]

235
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,140
and that he'd pay a good price.

236
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,900
The man looked desperate,

237
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,020
so I offered help as an old friend.

238
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,710
That's when he made his order.

239
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,180
He asked for 13 servings exactly.

240
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,700
You remember!

241
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,650
- Then why the hell -
- I already told you!

242
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,340
The note said 23 servings, not 13 servings.

243
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,600
I thought I misheard you.

244
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,960
Speaking of, could I see this note?

245
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,390
Here's the unshakeable proof.

246
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,820
This says...

247
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,760
23 servings - I can't read it any other way.

248
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,430
You clearly changed the "13" to be a "23".

249
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,280
- See, the ink here is...
- Why the hell would I do that?

250
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,570
You must've written "23". Ain't that right, Yoshie?

251
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,270
No, Mr. Roppei most certainly wrote "13 servings".

252
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,440
But when I checked the note with you later...

253
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,670
Is something wrong?

254
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,290
No, I just thought he asked for 13 servings.

255
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,950
Oh my.

256
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,900
I also saw the note which said "23 servings".

257
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,110
What a mysterious thing indeed.

258
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,980
This ain't a fun mystery, why the hell do you think we've been arguing?

259
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,020
Lay off, the missus here has no reason to lie!

260
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,050
- He's all trouble, isn't he?
- Truly.

261
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,920
- Thank you.
- Of course.

262
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,360
I see now.

263
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,910
You two are both in on it.

264
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,640
- Huh?
- I see no other explanation.

265
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,930
Hear me?

266
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,420
Letters don't just rewrite themselves.

267
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,660
Colluding against me, eh? I ain't falling for it.

268
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,710
Do you hear even yourself, you stubborn bastard?

269
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,900
You're doubting Yoshie!

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,040
"Yoshie"?

271
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,600
Now you're on first name basis?

272
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,720
We both used to be, long ago.

273
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,080
Yes, exactly. Before we all opened shops of our own.

274
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,490
Right. You two always got along all buddy-buddy.

275
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,440
Bet you both mock me

276
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,160
right behind my back, eh?

277
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,700
Dear...

278
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,060
First!

279
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,920
There is one thing that has been on my mind this entire time.

280
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,990
Mr. Roppei.

281
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,420
What?

282
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Don't you think your clients are waiting for their meals?

283
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,700
You're right.

284
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,840
Hurry now, hurry!

285
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,770
Goodness me...

286
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,540
I'm closing shop today.

287
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,030
Put up a notice.

288
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,790
Dear -

289
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,920
Leave me alone.

290
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,170
Ma'am!

291
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,280
Well then, I'm taking all 13 portions I ordered.

292
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,690
Pops.

293
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,390
- These leftovers -
- Nothing!

294
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,410
Let's be on our way, sir.

295
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,260
- But these leftovers...
- We can grab a Tsukumoyaki.

296
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,060
Can't you see now is really not the time?

297
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,780
But the leftovers...

298
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,290
It'll be my treat,

299
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,900
so please return to the office.

300
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,100
Mr. Iwai, who was wrong?

301
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,860
Dad isn't lying, is he?

302
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,020
Nope.

303
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,940
You just believe in your Pops, alright?

304
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,860
Your home's clear now.

305
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,740
- No one was lying.
- Head back inside,

306
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,720
you don't want to catch a cold.

307
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,690
- You're sure Dad's not lying?
- Or, have I...

308
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,380
Have I lost my ability to detect lies?

309
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,220
I can't hear the lies.

310
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,630
I've never even considered that a possibility.

311
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,660
Kanoko.

312
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,300
Your sleeves are fraying.

313
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,260
- See?
- You're right...

314
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,200
Shall I fix them for you?

315
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,540
Ma'am, does my back look alright?

316
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,400
Looks perfectly fine to me.

317
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,720
Thank you.

318
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,410
Ah, there's that raccoon.

319
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,790
- Excuse me.
- The other day - Oh, Kanoko.

320
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,350
How much is this?

321
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,450
You want to buy it?

322
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,960
It's 20 sen...
[T/N: Sen - a hundredth of a yen]

323
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,770
I see.

324
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,050
What if one of these was a lie?

325
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,870
I'm scared.

326
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,430
If people can't discern a truth from a lie...

327
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:35,040
then what are they supposed to believe? And how?

328
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,090
Do other people shoulder this sort of anxiousness all the time?

329
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,020
Right, the Tsukumoyaki.

330
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,330
Taro.

Let's play menko*.
[T/N: a game; throw down cards, to overturn other cards]

332
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,720
I can't today.

333
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,780
Why?

334
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,810
I finished my homework, too...

335
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,130
A lie. He's lying!

336
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,420
What's that sign?

337
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,680
Mom and Dad are fighting, so the store is closed.

338
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,010
Hey, could you say that again?

339
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,430
The thing about your homework?

340
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,230
I'm sorry, I actually haven't finished it yet.

341
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,610
Sorry, I promise I'm not mad.

342
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:35,830
I've always felt such an aversion to having this power.

343
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,020
This is the first time I've felt so relieved to hear a lie.

344
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,140
I apologize for being late.

345
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,830
Welcome back.

346
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
None of them are lying.

347
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,430
All of them heard, or saw Mr. Roppei refer to these "13 servings".

348
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,810
Now if only this note also matched their testimonies.

349
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,260
Ready and...

350
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,040
Maybe the note itself was swapped at some point.

351
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,480
I'll have to check the notebook this note was torn from later.

352
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Sir, why has it never occurred to you that I may be lying?

353
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,420
You can't perceive lies like I can.

354
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,800
Exactly, I can't. And that's it.

355
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,070
I have no ability to tell apart a lie from truth.

356
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,070
So I have to first choose to believe

357
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,980
and take that leap of faith,

358
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,950
knowing full well I could get hurt.

359
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,730
Mr. Iwai.

360
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,400
I also want to take a leap of faith.

361
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,200
- I want to believe in Mr. Hanasaki's case.
- Kaoru's?

362
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,910
He chose to believe in that lady's plea.

363
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,390
So I want to see whether she was truly in need,

364
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,400
or whether she was merely swindling him.

365
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,600
I want to look into this case.

366
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,980
Look into it, how?

367
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,480
For now, I'll ask around for information at the station.

368
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,900
Give it a go.

369
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,630
Don't worry, leave the Kurata case to me.

370
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,780
Thank you.

371
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,810
Then I'll be off.

372
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,010
Mr. Iwai, what is something you keep in mind while investigating a case?

373
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,510
I make sure to see things from the opposing person's perspective.

374
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,930
- How so?
- Don't make assumptions that only serve to benefit your logic.

375
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,640
It's important to think from an opposing standpoint as well.

376
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,480
I see.

377
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,170
In that case, your deduction that the lady was a swindler,

378
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,350
and Mr. Hanasaki's belief in her plea,

379
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,980
are both something to keep in mind as entirely possible, yes?

380
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,270
You've become a fine detective's assistant, haven't you?

381
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,750
Yes, sir.

382
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,940
- Take care.
- I will.

383
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,300
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

384
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,090
- Do you recall a lady three nights ago, who bought a ticket -
- Miss.

385
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,750
Sorry, but the line.

386
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,820
- My apologies.
- Anyone remember?

387
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,550
- Three nights ago? Can't say I do.
- Last call for passengers.

388
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,190
She was in a hurry, and holding a slip wishing for a safe birth.

389
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,730
Are you talking about a swindler?

390
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,780
I hear they come up with all sorts of excuses.

391
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,000
Miss, take care out there, alright?

392
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Anything you lend them is as good as gone.

393
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,840
Thank you again.

394
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't make assumptions that only serve to benefit your logic.

395
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,990
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

396
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,450
Do you have a moment?

397
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,780
Yes, what is it?

398
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,850
I must ask a favor of you.

399
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,120
Would you lend me money for a fare?

400
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,760
My mother who lives far off is on her death's bed.

401
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,080
She's... swindling me.

402
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I haven't been able to visit in a long while.

403
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,640
So I wish to see her one last time, before it's too late.

404
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,420
I promise to return the money.

405
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,910
I cannot lend you any money.

406
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,970
I've caused nothing but trouble for my poor mother.

407
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,250
I only hope to be a filial daughter for once.

408
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,130
Please, I beg you.

409
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,240
I'm sorry, but I can't.

410
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,360
Because you're not telling the truth.

411
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,670
You won't be riding a train with that money.

412
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,650
You don't plan on returning it either.

413
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,150
Your mother's condition, and the fact you haven't visited

414
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,850
are both lies, are they not?

415
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,400
What in the...

416
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,990

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,150
Creepy. Creepy. Creepy.

418
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,580
Mr. Hanasaki cannot hear lies like I do.

419
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,040
Even so, he chose to believe.

420
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,900
Please do not do this sort of thing any more.

421
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,720
What are you talking about?

422
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,050
It's not wrong to want riches.

423
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,840
But that is no reason to deceive people.

424
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,670
Please do not sully people's faith in others.

425
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,660
You are being absolutely rude.

426
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,190
You said you hoped to be a filial daughter.

427
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,340
And that's no lie, yes?

428
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,270
Are you going to thank your mother...

429
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,220
with the money you cheated from strangers?

430
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,640
Isn't there anything else I can do

431
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,730
to aid you and your mother?

432
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,780
If you believe what you are doing is wrong,

433
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,220
then please, put an end to this act.

434
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,320
Please.

435
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,980
Please, I beg you.

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,930
Excuse me.

Nope.

Sorry to bother you, sir.

445
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,570
That's definitely a "1".

Excuse me, may I ask...

447
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,480
Excuse me, ma'am. Could I have a moment of your time?

- Yeah...

Personally, I do not think I am well suited to being an officer.

484
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,010
Soma's deduction is entirely right.

485
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,550
Perhaps I have been swindled out of my money.

486
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,360

Mr. Hanasaki, you chose to believe.

You are kind,

492
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,430
and you are resilient.

493
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,910
I wonder.

494
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,530
Still, despite all the griping Soma does,

495
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,460
he always chooses to have faith in my actions.

496
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,520
Then you both must trust each other.

497
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,490
Of course not. Me, trusting Soma?

498
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,910

Sure thing.

502

Although, it is because Soma chooses to believe in me,

503
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,360
that I hope to stay someone worthy of his trust.

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:57,390

- Then you owe me one too.

526
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,890
What happened to that spiel, eh?

527
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,790
I suppose in that sense of the word...

528
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,430
- Hold on, how long have you been eavesdropping?
- Mr. Iwai.

529
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,440
I...

530
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,530
I wasn't able to do a thing.

531
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,490
No, that's not true.

532
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,420
- You did your best, and -
- Ms. Kanoko.

533
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,800
Let's head to the Kurata's.

534
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,470
Did you crack their case?

535
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,060
Want to join us, Kaoru? We might get a fancy dinner out of this.

536
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,930
Unlike you, I have business to attend.

537
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,260
[Beware of purse snatchers - Tsukumoyacho Police]

538
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,510
Mr. Roppei?

539
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,690
It's cold out, isn't it?

540
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,800
Nothing I can do about that.

541
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,210
Hey, we're still setting up!

542
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,240
I don't need the ladies, just give me something strong.

543
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,590
Come in, and I'm telling Madam.

544
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,220
- Just let me in.
- Mr. Roppei.

545
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,510
Mr. Iwai.

546
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,910
Before you get wasted, I want you to join us at the Kurata's.

547
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,450
What?

548
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,500
Your wife was quite worried about you.

549
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,100
Fine.

550
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,700
- Hey!
- Mr. Roppei!

551
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,910
How can that be, Mr. Iwai?

552
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,000
Sorry!

553
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,550
Neither of us are lying?

554
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,740
Does that mean my note changed on its own?

555
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,020
Exactly.

556
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,500
Did you bring your fountain pen?

557
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,840
Great. Then let's give this a try.

558
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,910
Yes, sir.

559
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:08,360
Three nights ago, Mr. Roppei wrote out an order for "13 servings" with this fountain pen.

560
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,610
Could you write that down again?

561
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,020
[13 servings, for the 19th]

562
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,230
He then tore the note out, folded it in half, and handed it to Ms. Kurata here.

563
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,460
I shall take it from here.

564
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,420
If either Mr. Roppei or Ms. Kurata held the note here,

565
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,860
the fresh ink from the fountain pen would transfer over.

566
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,990
So when you open the note once more...

567
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,370
There.
[23 servings, for the 19th]

568
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,610
Give it a look, Taro.

569
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,710
Which means...

570
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,730
Yup. No one was lying.

571
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,640
Unbelievable.

572
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,930
Don't be using a fountain pen like some rich man, use a pencil!

573
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,870
You're the one who complained when I wrote in pencil, hooligan!

574
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,550
What did you just call me?

575
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,380
No way am I apologizing. Not over my grave.

576
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,350
The one you owe an apology to ain't me, it's Yoshie!

577
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,390
You doubted her!

578
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,320
No, I just...

579
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,960
Everything is alright, Taro.

580
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,710
I'm sorry if we worried you.

581
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,680
Look, just...

582
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,400
Quit calling her Yoshie, alright?

583
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,950
"Quit calling her Yoshie"!

584
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,730
You're small-minded for a big guy.

585
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,400
The hell did you just say?

586
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,370
You have to make up, you're bothering everyone.

587
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,760
Right?

588
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,980
I suppose so.

589
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,560
Right, I guess I owe you one too, Mr. Iwai -

590
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,700
- Ouch.
- A catered meal?

591
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,690
- Whatever, take as many as you want.
- Score!

592
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,450
Taro, come on.

593
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,980
Take a share as well, Kanoko.

594
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,310
Thank you.

595
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,780
- Mr. Iwai!
- Maybe one at a time is better.

596
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,580
That's not the issue here.

597
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,590
Mr. Iwai, I've saved the box you ate from, just for you.

598
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,570
In any case, the mystery was resolved without hitch.

599
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,740
I'm starving.

600
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,840
Feel free to eat without me.

601
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,900
I'm going to feed Inari first.

602
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,790
Is that so? Then I'll pour us some tea.

603
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,820
Thank you.

604
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,920
Ms. Kanoko.

605
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,740
Yes, sir?

606
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,720
Thank you.

607
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,690
You chose to believe for Kaoru's sake.

608
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,380
Still...

609
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,810
The truth of that lady he met...

610
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,410
remains a mystery.

611
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,540
Even if she's never found,

612
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,410
or she ends up being a swindler,

613
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,110
the fact of the matter is you chose to believe with him.

614
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,070
I'm sure your solidarity made him very happy.

615
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,560
I was very happy, too.

616
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,900
You encouraged me to take that leap of faith,

617
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,510
when I expressed the desire to do so.

618
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,940
That was because you also believed in me, yes?

619
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,590
Mr. Hanasaki is clearly someone you cherish.

620
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,670
So I wanted to do my best, for someone you treasure dearly.

621
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,860
I can't believe I have someone like you at my side.

622
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,560
I'm truly a lucky guy.

623
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,410
Even if I lose my ability to detect these lies,

624
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,840
I want to remain an assistant...

625
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,160
who is worthy of Mr. Iwai's trust.

626
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,970
Kanoko.

627
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,030
Mr. Kurata!

628
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,280
Sorry for causing you two trouble today.

629
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,610
It's no worry at all.

630
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,210
I'm simply glad the case is now closed.

631
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,020
Mr. Iwai sure is an amazing guy, huh?

632
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,440
He is, indeed.

633
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,960
What an outcome though.

634
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,330
A sorry show we put on, I'd say.

635
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,770
But sir.

636
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:14,430
Mr. Iwai believed in you, Mr. Roppei, and Mrs. Kurata.

637
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:18,760
He was only able to deduce the truth,

638
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,210
because he trusted you all would never lie.

639
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,480
I guess so.

640
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,450
Yet we couldn't even believe each other.

641
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,350
Pathetic.

642
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,440
Mr. Kurata...

643
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,330
May I?

644
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,770
Sure.

645
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,380
Excuse me!

646
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,940
Sorry!

647
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,980
Are you alright?

648
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,730
Now then.

649
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,180
Let's dig in -

650
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,800
Soma!

651
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,590
- Ms. Urabe!
- Why do you look so disheveled?

652
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,490
I received a letter from that lady at the station.

653
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,850
She included a letter, and money to pay her fare as well.

654
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,770
Then she wasn't a swindler?

655
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,780
Yes! Because she had her wallet stolen,

656
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,480
- Leave.
- everyone assumed she was a common swindler.

657
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,440
She says my aid was like a blessing from the heavens!

658
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,540
Her daughter had a safe delivery as well.

659
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,960
And you came all this way, to boast about it?

660
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,410
Yes!

661
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,410
[One case closed - two cases closed]

662
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,290
It seems I am destined to believe in people.

663
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,740
Great, now leave.

664
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,030
- What?
- We have a luxurious dinner to enjoy.

665
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,600
Mr. Hanasaki.

666
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,050
Would you like to join us?

667
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,020
Don't you dare eat my share!

668
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm already cutting corners!

669
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,390
No need to act territorial, sir.

670
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:10,930
He treated me earlier, so he can take from my share.

671
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,320
Eat! Eat up!
[Feel free to take anything]

672
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,620
Don't act like you did all the cooking, you hooligan.

673
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,940
Thanks for dinner, Pops!

674
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,320
- Why are you suddenly pouring for me?
- I just felt like it.

675
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,310
My, I wonder if my husband would do the same.

676
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,730
Dream on.

677
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,290
You haven't learned a damn thing!

678
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,750
- Say what?
- Ma'am!

679
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,160
I'll pour you a drink.

680
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,420
You, shut it.

681
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,730
This is delicious.

682
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,170
Delectable.

683
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,050
Divine, even.

684
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,100
But why are you sitting there?

685
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,040
- You'll owe the Kurata's for life.
- Yum.

686
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,510
Worry not, sir. This was given to us as a reward.

687
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,650
My tastebuds are in heaven!

688
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,300
I suppose if Ms. Urabe insists...

689
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,810
People experience a certain anxiousness when it comes to trust.

690
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,460
They experience hurt.

691
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,280
They experience doubt.

692
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,560
Yet still they choose to believe.

693
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,610
Because they are resilient, and strong.

694
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,100
[To be continued]

695
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,600
At long last, I was reunited with my grandson.
[Not one, but two long lost grandsons appear?]

696
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,320
However, another one appeared not long after.
[Not one, but two long lost grandsons appear?]

697
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,940
- As things stand, you could take your pick.
- Mr. Iwai!

698
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,870
Was there some sort of incident?

699
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,500
Your expression says "this is only trouble".

700
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,490
You ain't tricking her.

701
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,510
No, that's impossible.
