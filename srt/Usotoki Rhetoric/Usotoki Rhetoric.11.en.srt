[Tsukumoyacho - First Year of the Showa Era (1926)]

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,990
Congratulations, my lady!

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,450
Right then, let's head home.

7
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,730
Oden, oden, dinner tonight is O-D-E-N!
[T/N: Oden - a one pot dish; ingredients simmer in a light broth]

8
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,610
I'm looking forward to it.

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,040
I've never had oden at the Kurata's before.

10
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,220
What's your oden ingredient of choice?

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,660
I personally like radishes.

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,150
Taro, as well.

13
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,520
Both excellent choices.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,990
What do you like, Mr. Iwai?

15
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,480
I love me a good fish cake.

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,150
I see.

17
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,850
Nothing beats a white, fluffy, soft...

18
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,730
- Fish cake!
- Fish cake!

19
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,520
I enjoy hearing about the things Mr. Iwai likes.

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,000
It leaves me with a spring in my step.

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,300
Mr. Iwai.
[Kurata Eatery]

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm getting hungry.

23
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,200
So am I.

24
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,180
- Sir...
- Excuse me.

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,130
Y-Yes?

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,670
Would you happen to be Mr. Soma Iwai?

27
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,520
- Nope.
- Sir!

28
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,280
Did you have a request for us?

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,200
I come as an acquaintance of your landlady.

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,310
She has graciously allowed me to stay with you folks for a while.

31
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,800
- Huh?
- Pardon?

32
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,840
Well...

33
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,980
She isn't lying.

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,370
- Stay...
- With us?

35
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,090
Yes. I will be in your care.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,480
I was stuck wandering these winding alleyways to get here.

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,450
I thought I'd pass out from the cold.

38
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,320
I hope this can help a bit.

39
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,780
So, care to explain exactly what's going on here?

40
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,810
This is just water.

41
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,900
Sometimes I can offer a bit more.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,430
You really are poor.

43
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,570
Answer my question.

44
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,330
Your landlady said I could stay for a while.

45
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,610
Yes, but I'm asking why.

46
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,600
Look me in the eye.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,390
Do I look like a liar to you?

48
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,400
Say...

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,190
You have quite the pretty face.

50
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,000
Why, thank you.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,700
You are so not cute.

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,350
What is your relationship to our landlady?

53
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,940
She called out to me along Tsukumoya Bridge,

54
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,350
as I was wandering the streets without a spot of pocket change.

55
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,430
She then offered me a place here, until I figure something out.

56
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,530
This is my office.

57
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,270
She also said the residents here would have no right to refuse.

58
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,380
Worry not, I'll leave as soon as I find a place for myself.

59
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,910
You have no job, nor money to your name.

60
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,290
How are you going to afford the rent here?

61
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,050
If I alone paid rent, you two would become the freeloaders, no?

62
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,140
But a detective agency? Sounds fun.

63
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,110
We have no open rooms for you.

64
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,690
So you're poor, and a cheapskate.

65
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,600
Are you telling me to sleep out in the cold streets?

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,660
Here.

67
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,830
I was told to hand this to you, if you were being stubborn.
[Iwai]

68
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,360
What is this I'm feeling?

69
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,530
I know I'm here for practically the same reason,

70
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,830
but something is...

71
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,400
You're the detective's assistant, correct?

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,510
- Yes.
- Is that fun?

73
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,000
Fun...

74
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,110
Either way, this doesn't seem like a well-paying job in the slightest.

75
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,590
Ms. Kanoko.

76
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,860
Yes, sir?

77
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,110
Let's allow her to stay.

78
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,850
Remember, Missus Kanoko. We must help our neighbors.

79
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,400
Missus Kanoko?

80
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,470
Welcome to our abode, miss.

81
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,580
Why the change of heart?

82
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,910
Hello there, Iwai.

83
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,670
When I found the lass who brought you this letter,

84
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,840
she looked to be absolutely troubled.

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,800
Although she didn't divulge her circumstances,

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,190
I couldn't leave her be.

87
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,380
Please let her stay for a while.

88
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,420
I'll even overlook all your unpaid rent until now.

89
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,800
- All of it?
- How about it, Ms. Kanoko?

90
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,670
I'll be in your care.

91
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,150
Mr. Soma.

92
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,350
Kanoko.

93
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,400
The pleasure's ours, Ms. Rent.

94
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,730
What's with that moniker?

95
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,190
Well, we never got a name.

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,600
Reiko Aoki.

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,640
Reiko is written as "graceful-child", and Aoki is "blue-tree".

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,220
She's lying.

99
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,880
I can hear the grating noise in her voice.

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,550
Pleased to meet you.

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,850
This spells trouble.

102
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,000
Real trouble.

- Your oden.
- Thank you.

106
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,000
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,860
My husband isn't in tonight, so dinner is oden.

108
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,850
He's off catering at Lord Murakami's banquet, was it?

109
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,400
You're well informed.

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,010
Kaoru's family was invited as well.

111
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,370
I see. My, do you have a guest tonight?

112
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,700
Yes. Shall I help?

113
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,540
No need, dear. It's only oden.

114
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,940
Fish cake, please!

115
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,630
I'm so sorry, Mr. Iwai. I just served our last slice.

116
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,670
- WHAT?
- What a scream...

117
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,090
My fish cake...

118
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,810
Now, now.

119
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,070
Still, what an absolute beauty we've got here tonight.

120
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,020
Your drab agency is finally getting a bit of color, eh?

121
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,020
My, you flatter me.

122
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,680
How about you come drink with us?

123
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,440
May I really?

- Here.
- Thank you, sir.

125
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,030
There you go.

126
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,570
Ms. Kanoko.

127
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,800
Yes?

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,520
Eat some taro.

129
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,710
But sir, this is your share.

130
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,500
Taro's your favorite, right?

131
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,210
Thank you.

132
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,420
- How delicious.
- So what, the company you were working for went bankrupt?

133
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,020
Yes. I was then chased out of the company dorms soon after.

134
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,850
Sounds rough.

135
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,440
What about your family?

136
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,070
I cannot count on their help. We're quite poor, after all.

137
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,050
I also have a younger brother and sister who rely on me.

138
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,990
I work to make ends meet for us all.

139
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,140
Ms. Reiko only lies when she's talking about herself.

140
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,780
Who exactly is she?

141
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,010
Then why not work here?

142
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,780
True.

143
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,720
That's a wonderful idea.

144
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,040
I'm sure the store could use a hand. You could call in customers.

145
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,170
Then may I ask to be considered for a job here?

146
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,210
I'm sorry, dear. But we're plenty fine as is.

147
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,430
I see.

148
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,530
Something is bothering me, but what?

149
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,630
It feels like a precious "something" is being broken to pieces.

150
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,950
Ms. Kanoko.

151
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,050
Yes?

152
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,800
Ms. Reiko had gloves with a Suzuran lily on them, didn't she?
[T/N: Suzuran - Lily of the valley]

153
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,030
I believe she did, yes.

154
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,770
And Suzurans are summer flowers, aren't they?

155
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,300
Yes. They blossom before the rainy season.

156
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,290
But what of it?

157
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,920
Is that lass staying long?

158
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,750
That's what I want to know.

159
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,830
I don't mean to suggest you chase her out.

160
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,790
We must help our neighbors, after all.

161
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,910
Still... she doesn't look to be particularly troubled by anything.

162
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,310
In any case.

163
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,270
I'll be adding her tab to your growing bill.

164
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,200
- What?
- But of course. We're no charity.

165
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,170
H-Hold your horses, Ma'am. Is there anything we can do to help?

166
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,550
We'll do anything.

167
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,800
Anything at all?

168
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,190
- Yes.
- Yup.

169
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,320
Thank you for dinner.

170
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,680
Thank you.

171
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,600
What's with all the chestnuts?

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,180
- They're for us to peel.
- Huh.

173
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,540
Don't act like you didn't hear Mrs. Kurata.

174
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,500
Must be lucky having such a delicious eatery next door.

175
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,730
You'll be helping us peel these.

176
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,070
I hear you.

177
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,710
Ms. Reiko.

178
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,500
Aoki Reiko is not your real name, is it?

179
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,700
You're lying to us, are you not?

180
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,700
Yup.

181
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm a liar.

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,210
I always have been.

183
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,750
No one knows the real me.

184
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,280
Are you alright?

185
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,820
Fine, fine.

186
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,940
Would my room be on the second floor?

187
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,090
If you don't mind staying with me, then yes.

188
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,450
- Is that alright?
- Of course.

189
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,060
Then we'll sleep together.

190
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,270
Ms. Kanoko.

191
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,600
Oh? I wouldn't mind sleeping with you instead, Mr. Soma.

192
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,490
That's another lie.

193
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,970
Bingo.

194
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,790
Besides, what's the harm? Kanoko doesn't seem to mind sharing.

195
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,070
Don't worry, I won't do a thing to her.

196
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,890
- Soma!
- What now, Kaoru?

197
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,280
- Help me out.
- Huh?

198
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,180
Apologies, I didn't realize you had a guest.

199
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,420
She's no guest.

200
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,820
- Pay me no mind.
- So?

201
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,340
Sorry, Ms. Urabe. I'll be borrowing Soma.

202
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,570
Soma, come with me!

203
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,500
Is everything alright?

204
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,870
Being in Mr. Soma's company seems like troublesome ordeal.

205
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,560
Not necessarily.

206
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,500
Really now.

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,280
Mr. Iwai has a heart of gold.

208
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,460
He won't hesitate to help a person in need.

209
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,900
I'm sure he would lend you a hand as well, Ms. Reiko.

210
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,620
Kanoko, you must like Mr. Soma dearly.

211
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,450
What?

212
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,940
How cute.

213
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,280
Yes, as his assistant.

214
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,490
Then you'll continue to stay by Mr. Soma's side, as his assistant?

215
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,110
So long as I can be of use to him, yes.

216
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,090
If anything, I'd like to be his assistant forever.

217
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,170
Then what if Mr. Iwai gets married?

218
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,540
- Pardon?
- If he gets married,

219
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,780
will you still stay by his side, as his assistant?

220
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,930
Yes. I am an assistant, above all else.

221
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,100
That's what I had assumed as well.

222
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,700
I thought it would be enough to be at their side,

223
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,620
even if their heart was never mine.

224
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,950
I'm heading to bed.

225
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,130
Thanks again for having me.

226
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,150
Mr. Iwai.

227
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,050
We're home, Ms. Kanoko.

228
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,230
Is this a client of ours?

229
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,690
What are you talking about?

230
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,070
This is my wife, remember?

231
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,040
Right.

232
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,350
Mr. Iwai got married.

233
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,210
You're still awake?

234
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,430
What's on your mind?

235
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,740
I-It's nothing.

236
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,490
You could have just gone to bed.

237
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,320
Sir, take a look at this.

238
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,800
Ms. Chiyo's father is a generous man.

Maybe I'll ask him to donate to our cause as well.
[Donating a Music Classroom to a Local Elementary School]

240
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,830
Speaking of, was everything alright with Mr. Hanasaki?

241
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah. He had me run around town looking for Miyabi.

242
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,040
Did Ms. Miyabi disappear?

243
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,760
She was almost forced into more talks about marriage

244
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,380
and ran out in a frenzy.

245
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,120
Kaoru realized she was missing, and grew anxious.

246
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,730
Did you end up finding her?

247
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,090
Find her? She was having the time of her life in a mahjong parlor.

248
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,660
There.

249
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,170
Ron.

250
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,260
Pay up.

251
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,990
Ron.

252
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,870
A fine play.

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,970
Kaoru was just raising a fuss.

256
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,560
He pulled me along for the ride.

257
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,100
I'm glad it wasn't anything dire.

258
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,680
Ms. Kanoko.

259
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,240
Yes?

260
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,420
Leave the chestnut peeling for tomorrow,

261
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,340
and turn in for the night.

262
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,890
Okay.

263
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,810
Good night.

264
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,540
Night.

265
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,970
Mr. Iwai, getting married?

266
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,110
I'd never even thought about it before.

267
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:02,320
But it could very well happen in the near future.

268
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,790
Good morning.

269
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,270
Morning, Ms. Kanoko.

270
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,750
Huh?

271
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,730
Did you peel the remaining chestnuts?

272
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,150
No.

273
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,480
You're finally awake, you sleepyheads.

274
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,010
Ms. Reiko, did you peel all this?

275
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,680
Of course. My hands hurt.

276
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,970
It was for your tab.

277
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,090
Here, these need to be washed, don't they?

278
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,540
Yes.

279
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,080
Mr. Iwai has caught on to something.

280
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,520
The page with the article about Chiyo Fujishima's father was the only one missing.

281
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,630
And you suppose Ms. Reiko was the one who took it?

282
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,970
I'd bet there was something written there, that she didn't want us knowing about.

283
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,380
Mr. Soma! Ms. Kanoko!

284
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,830
I have brought the paper!

285
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,450
Thank you.

286
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,040
If you have requested my aid, I shall do anything I can to help.

287
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,460
Now why did you need my father's article?

288
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,070
His article is right here.

289
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,400
- Yes, I'm aware.
- He donated a music classroom to an elementary school.

290
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,030
Three pianos, and ten violins as well.

291

- In fact, I shall be -

292

This mentions a young woman here.

Let's see.

294
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,760
A burglary?

295
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,670
No, I don't think this is it.

296
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,800
This says the burglar had a broken arm, and she certainly doesn't.

297
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,780
I suppose not.

298
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,620
What is this all about?

- See you again.
- Bye now.

You said your name was Mr. Iwai, yes?

I am Suzuno Makihara.

Ms. Suzuno...

310
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,150
Suzuno! Ranko was found?

311
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,670
Mr. Masaki...

312
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,650
Where is Ranko?

313
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,860
We were about to discuss that.

314
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,140
My name is Masaki Suzumura.

315
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,790
Please allow me to listen in as well.

316
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,050
Mr. Suzumura?

317
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,450
That makes another "Suzu-Ran".

318
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,790
As you may have heard, I work as a detective.

319
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,510
Currently, I am attempting to identify a certain woman.

320
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,150
This woman claims her name is "Ranko".

321
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,900
She barges into people's homes, gorges on food without paying,

322
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,180
and is a nit-picky, troublesome individual.

323
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,580
He means it.

324
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,480
And you believe this is our Ranko?

325
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,640
With how she is, "Ranko" may not even be her real name.

326
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,420
If you both do not mind, could I see a picture of your Ranko?

327
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,840
Of course.

328
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,880
Ranko is on the right here.

329
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,860
Mr. Iwai...

330
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,160
Nope, this isn't the one.

331
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,220
It seems the Ranko I'm investigating is someone else.

332
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,480
Is that so?

333
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,310
Mr. Iwai must have a plan.

334
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,890
However, as I mentioned earlier, I work as a detective.

335
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,020
Perhaps this encounter was meant to be.

336
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,290
If you would like, I can take on this search for Ranko.

337
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,630
And at a bargain price, at that.

338
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,270
- Mr. Iwai.
- He knows where she is.

339
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,820
He's pretending to be unaware...

340
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,190
All to get a job.

341
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,710
Let's request his help.

342
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,900
Yes, let's.

343
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,960
Would you please search for Ranko?

344
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,430
But of course.

345
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,130
Sir, you're cheating these people.

346
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,270
Now then, could you tell us more of this "Ranko"?

347
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,210
Her full name is Ranko Akashi.

348
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,510
She is the same age as myself, 22 years old.

349
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,910
She came to my family as a live-in housemaid when she was 12, because she had no other relatives to take her in.

350
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,250
My name is Ranko Akashi. I'm pleased to meet you all.

351
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,510
She will be in your care.

352
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,880
I'm Suzuno. Nice to meet you!

Nice to meet you, too.

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,790
She was a bright and valiant girl.

00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:22,380
We grew up together, like real sisters.

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,510
Suzuno and Ranko.

357
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,250
We would call each other the Suzuran Sisters.

358
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,390
I cannot imagine there was any issue within the household.

359
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,190
I see.

360
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,620
My family lives right next door.

361
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,870
I would occasionally come to tutor Suzuno.

362
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,370
That was when I first met Ranko as well.

363
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,260
This is Masaki Suzumura.

364
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,590
He is currently tutoring me in English.

365
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,520
My name is Masaki Suzumura.

366
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

367
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,210
Ranko was a brilliant individual.

368
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,910
At 17, she began working alongside me at my family's tailor.

369
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,710
She was an efficient worker,

370
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,550
who was well received by customers and other employees alike.

371
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,100
And yet...

372
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,920
Ten days ago, she suddenly disappeared without a trace.

373
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,280
All her belongings, both work and personal, were gone.

374
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,130
She had only left some essentials, all cleanly packed away.

375
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,890
This was not a kidnapping of sorts.

376
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,680
She had clearly left with purpose.

377
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,510
Is there any reason you think she would leave?

378
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,730
Just one.

379
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,910
Suzuno...

380
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,470
No, we must tell them. We're running short on time.

381
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,120
What is it?

382
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:49,070
One month ago, Mr. Masaki and I were betrothed to each other.

383
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,300
Our official engagement is tomorrow.

384
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,310
Oh.

385
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:00,010
- Congratulations!
- Ranko was overjoyed to hear the news.

386
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,870
But what if...

387
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,910
I'm telling you, you misunderstand.

388
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,280
The one who spent the most time with Mr. Masaki...

389
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,460
was Ranko.

390
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,560
Ranko simply worked hard as my right-hand.

391
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,640
She even supported us, knowing how I felt about you.

392
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,300
I thought it would be enough to be at their side,

393
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,080
even if their heart was never mine.

394
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,340
She was referring to Mr. Masaki.

395
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,560
There is one thing I am left confused about.

396
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:47,650
Ms. Suzuno. If you believe Ms. Ranko left due to your engagement,

397
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,030
what will you do upon finding her?

398
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,580
I understand you worry as her dear friend,

399
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,930
and that she abandoned her role at the tailor. However...

400
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,830
If my engagement pains Ranko...

401
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,440
then I hope to call off my marriage to Mr. Masaki.

402
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,220
What?

403
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,290
So please, Mr. Detective. Please, find Ranko for us.

404
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,640
Please, sir.

405
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,080
We only want to clear up this misunderstanding.

406
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,920
I do not want this to end our marriage...

407
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,430
This whole thing turned out to be more troublesome than I assumed.

408
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:41,440
Why did you lie, and act as if you didn't know Ms. Ranko?

409
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,200
Despite how bothersome that woman may be,

410
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,750
I can't send someone home without knowing their circumstances,

411
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,500
especially if they're not exactly willing to return.

412
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,990
What are we to do?

413
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,680
Ms. Suzuno and Mr. Masaki are not to blame.

414
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,080
In fact, no one is at fault.

415
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,320
No one is to blame, and yet...

416
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,370
♪ The bubbles flew high into the sky ♪

417
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,720
♪ Then they all popped, and disappeared ♪

418
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,120
Ms. Reiko.

419
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,490
You two are finally home.

420
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm starving.

421
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,770
Let's go to the Kurata's.

422
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,590
Ms. Ranko.

423
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,440
You are Ms. Ranko Akashi, are you not?

424
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,700
Or should I say, the Ranko of "Suzuran"?

425
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,070
You...

426
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,930
You really were a detective.

427
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:10,730
How much were you able to find out?

428
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,580
Ms. Suzuno told us everything she knew.

429
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,270
She told us you both got along like sisters.

430
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,300
And that you worked as a tailor as well.

431
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,800
Is that all?

432
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,440
She also told us Mr. Masaki Suzumura is to marry Ms. Suzuno.

433
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,020
I see.

434
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,090
Last night, the person you were referring to...

435
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,930
was Mr. Masaki Suzumura, was it not?

436
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:01,880
I mean, a housemaid like myself and someone like Mr. Masaki would never work out now, would it?

437
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,030
Huh?

438
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,920
Gosh, detectives sure are perceptive.

439
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,930
Looks like my secret's out.

440
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,130
Ms. Suzuno was crying.

441
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,870
She thought her marriage was making you suffer.

442
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,170
She's even willing to break off her engagement.

443
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,350
What?

444
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,740
I think you both ought to talk it out.

445
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,060
I suppose so.

446
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,760
Then I shall head home.

447
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,530
Although it was only a day, I had quite some fun.

448
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,190
Wait...

449
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,700
Why do people lie?

450
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,450
I've decided to propose to Ms. Suzuno.

451
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,010
Will you give us your blessing, Ranko?

452
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,230
Of course.

453
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,640
I'm sure it'll go well.

454
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,130
If everyone lost their ability to lie,

455
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,230
would they lead happier lives?

456
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,380
Or would it be distressing?

457
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,680
Ranko! Ranko!

458
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,120
My father has approved of Mr. Masaki's proposal!

459
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,690
Congratulations, my lady!

460
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,660
What do you two want now?

461
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,590
I see you lied about heading home.

462
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,850
Ms. Ranko, the liar.

463
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,740
And?

464
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,840
Are you telling me to go home so they can finally get married?

465
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,020
Then fine, I will.

466
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,300
We were requested to find you, Ms. Ranko.

467
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,780
Then just tell them where I am.

468
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,220
Depending on your reason, I don't think I will.

469
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,850
But it depends on your reason.

470
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,600
Ms. Ranko, would you please tell us the reason you left home?

471
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,310
The real reason.

472
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,060
The real reason?

473
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,760
He won't hesitate to help a person in need.

474
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm sure he would lend you a hand as well, Ms. Reiko.

475
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,420
What sort of reason should I give, hm?

476
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,840
A reason where, hypothetically, your heart wasn't yearning for Mr. Masaki,

477
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,930
but for Ms. Suzuno Makihara.

478
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,800
Those gloves of yours.

479
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,560
They were a gift from Ms. Suzuno, yes?

480
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,870
You wouldn't cherish those gloves nor keep them

481
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,820
if Ms. Suzuno were your rival in love.

482
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,270
These are for you.

483
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,480
A Suzuran lily?

484
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,030
I know that's an out-of-season embroidery for a glove,

485
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,510
but if I am to give you any gift, it must be adorned with this flower.

486
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,330
They're gloves for us, the Suzuran Sisters.

487
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,110
Thank you.

488
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,320
I'll treasure them.

489
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,350
This was a secret for me and myself only.

490
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,440
Both our gender and social standing

491
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,880
were reasons why this would never work.

492
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,790
But above all else...

493
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,840
My lady's heart has always been for Mr. Masaki alone.

494
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,870
Whether it be friendship...

495
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,580
or affection...

496
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,500
My heart has always been for my lady.

497
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Of course...

498
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,610
That includes my love, as well.

499
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,840
But you know what?

500
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,730
I've come to realize something.

501
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,190
When I wished for her happiness, that was only a lie.

502
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,850
A lie?

503
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,490
Congratulations.

504
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,450
Congratulations, my lady!

505
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:00,320
I couldn't earnestly hope for her happiness. I was so frustrated with myself.

506
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:08,340
I don't want my lady to see me at my worst.

507
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,690
I don't want to force myself to lie.

508
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,700
She doesn't want to lie to someone she treasures.

509
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,280
But she also can't tell them the truth.

510
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,630
I know this feeling all too well.

511
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,450
In any case...

512
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,850
I can't return home anymore.

513
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,020
If you can only hope for her happiness with a lie,

514
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,190
then why not just lie for as long as you need to?

515
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,650
- Sir?
- Pardon?

516
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,350
Not everything goes the way you'd want it to in life.

517
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:58,100
And that includes your very heart.

518
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,370
If everything went exactly as we'd hope it to,

519
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,900
then no one in this world would lie.

520
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,250
When something doesn't go the way we want it to,

521
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,160
we try to change its course so that it does.

522
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,360
That is when people lie.

523
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,940
"I wish things went differently."

524
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,660
"I wish they'd do this instead".

525
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,810
Lies aren't simply "false statements".

526
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,570
They're statements, filled with the speaker's hopes.

527
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,350
They're filled with desire.

528
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,310
They're filled, with wishes.

529
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,800
Perhaps the reason for your lie

530
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,110
is because you cannot wish for Ms. Suzuno's happiness.

531
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,490
But it's also because you still hope to do so.

532
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,910
You want to wish for Ms. Suzuno's happiness.

533
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,000
You're entirely right.

534
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,090
I cannot sincerely hope for it...

535
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,570
And yet, I wish that I could.

536
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,140
I'm such a troublesome woman.

537
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,770
That's my line.

538
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,290
I suppose so.

539
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,180
Are you against returning to Ms. Suzuno,

540
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,420
and having to keep up the lie?

541
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,120
Of course I'm against it.

542
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,140
If only I honestly believed that.

543
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,940
I'll lie.

544
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,330
With all my heart.

545
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,060
Then let's head back.

546
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,030
It's cold, I'm starving, and it's dark out.

547
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,640
Besides, you've missed the last train.

548
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,680
Let's head back, Ms. Ranko.

549
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,100
Whenever people lie,

550
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,470
I hear a grating noise.

551
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:40,100
As if a harsh metallic sound overlaps those words.

552
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,760
Lies may be used for selfish tricks and schemes.

553
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,500
As way of protecting oneself, or others.

554
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,870
For appearances, or out of consideration.

555
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,570
For fear of being reprimanded.

556
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,030
To be envied by others.

557
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,660
To make someone happy.

558
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,470
To help another.

559
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,190
Lies can be ugly.

560
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,220
And they can also be kind.

561
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,000
My lady?

562
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,360
- Ranko!
- Ranko!

563
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,110
I'm terribly sorry I worried you both.

564
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,650
My lady, Mr. Masaki.

565
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,300
I wish for both of your happiness, from the bottom of my heart.

566
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,890
I always have, and I always will.

567
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:50,250
If there are some things one can only perceive from hearing lies,

568
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,590
then what I really hear...

569
00:38:53,590 --> 00:39:00,630
may be the wishes and desires of these people.

570
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,610
Thank you both, for everything.

571
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,770
I'll expect a payment for your stay in due time.

572
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,480
I know.

573
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,700
Please come visit us again.

574
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,280
But of course.

575
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,850
Honestly, spending life with you may not be so bad, Mr. Soma.

576
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,520
That's another lie.

577
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,030
You're entirely right.

578
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,600
I have enough one-sided affections to deal with anyway.

579
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,140
Besides, you already have someone right at your side.

580
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,940
Good luck, Kanoko.

581
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,320
I am only his assistant -

582
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:51,100
My words are what REALLY spell trouble.

583
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,280
It's okay. Mr. Iwai can't perceive lies.

584
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,750
Then we shall see you again.

585
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,250
See you.

586
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,730
See you again.

587
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,130
I wonder what's for dinner tonight?

588
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,920
Perhaps chestnut rice, with the chestnuts Ms. Ranko peeled.

589
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,450
Do you like chestnut rice, Ms. Kanoko?

590
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,470
I do. I'm a fan of chestnuts with sweet potatoes as well.

591
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,000
A sweet treat for the ages.

592
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,880
What do you like, Mr. Iwai?

593
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,740
I personally enjoy chestnut yokan.
[T/N: Yokan - a jellied dessert, usually in the shape of a block]

594
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,590
I see.

595
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,780
Ms. Kurata's chestnut yokan is especially divine.

596
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,610
Is that so?

597
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,040
I'm hungry.

598
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,190
So am I.

599
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,940
Excuse me.

600
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,600
Yes?

601
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,010
I have come under Mr. Masaki Suzumura, and Ms. Suzuno's orders.

602
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,530
This is for you.

603
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,380
Here you go.

604
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,860
Thank you very much.

605
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,260
There.

606
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,480
- One hundred yen?
- One hundred?
[T/N: About 164,500 modern yen]

607
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,200
Holy -

608
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,930
S-Sir?

609
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,910
One hundred yen!

610
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,920
But we practically cheated them of this job.

611
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,230
Can we really accept this?

612
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,910
It's fine, Ms. Ranko's rent is a part of it.

613
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,330
I can't believe it, one hundred yen.

614
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,550
In that case...

615
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,340
These would be...

616
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,800
Scarves!

617
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,260
They look so nice, don't they?

618
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,730
You're right.

619
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,580
How adorable.

620
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,360
Yours has a deer?

621
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,820
Yes. And it seems like yours is a horse.

622
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,450
A horse and deer?
[T/N: "Idiot" is written in Chinese characters as "Horse" and "Deer"]

623
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,980
- Get ready.
- Right.

624
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,480
Pops, you look terrifying.

625
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,820
Let me be.

626
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,040
Please smile.

627
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,820
- I am smiling.
- You are not.

628
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,940
Mr. Iwai, Kanoko.

629
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,500
Are you all taking a photo?

630
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,490
For a magazine, in fact.

631
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,160
Our store was chosen as the best eatery in Tsukumoyacho.

632
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,130
Not the best.

633
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,700
Just a reputed store.

634
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,550
Same difference.

635
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,770
- Is that amazing?
- It sure is.

636
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,810
You two should join the shot.

637
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,610
I only want a family photo.

638
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,500
Why not, it's a special occasion.

639
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,120
Come on, you two.

640
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,210
We don't want to cause trouble...

641
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,870
Alright then.

642
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,040
- Let's get this photo.
- Huh?

643
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,630
Mr. Iwai, could you help?

644
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,830
Get a good angle of the lot of us.

645
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,550
Ready?

646
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,940
Move a bit... Perfect.

647
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,810
Now smile.

648
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,910
Tatsu!

649
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,830
- You're gonna be in the papers?
- No, a magazine, you dunce.

650
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,490
That's amazing.

651
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,390
Let me join the fun.

652
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,740
- Gramps.
- Come here.

653
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,650
I'm taking the picture.

654
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,080
Come stand here.

655
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,350
- What's going on here?
- Mr. Hanasaki!

656
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,040
- Come join us as well.
- Ms. Shinako?

657
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,100
- Stand here.
- It's refreshing to be on the other side of the lens for once.

658
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,870
Alright, stop it right there, people!

659
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,380
- Ready, and...
- Hold on a moment!

660
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,100
I will not be left out this time.

661
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,650
Mother, Father!

662
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,630
Good day, the name's Fujishima.

663
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,830
Excuse us both.

664
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,820
I am his wife.

665
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,160
It's nice to meet you all.

666
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,990
- Come on.
- Hurry!

667
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,530
I'll be taking the picture now.

668
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,550
Inari.

669
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,500
Inari's not here!

670
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,650
Ms. Ranko stirred a chaotic storm within my heart.

671
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,570
I always want to stay by Mr. Iwai's side, as his trusty assistant.

672
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,340
Or so, I had thought.

673
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,650
Are you doing alright, Ms. Kanoko?

674
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,750
Yes, sir.

675
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,450
Alright get ready folks.

676
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,480
- Three, two, one.
- But now...
