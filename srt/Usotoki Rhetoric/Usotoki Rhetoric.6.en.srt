[Hideyoshi Mayume]

2
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,260
Okay.

3
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,420
I have the ability to detect lies.

4
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,880
Sorry little guy.

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,240
And thanks to Mr. Iwai's acceptance of my quirk,

6
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,000
I feel welcome in this town,

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,550
without need to live in fear of my power.

8
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,780
At least, that is what I've come to believe.

9
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,430
Which is especially why I want to hurry and prove my worth to him.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,870
- Hey there, Kanoko.
- Good morning.

11
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,360
Here, Inari's breakfast.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,180
Thank you again, sir.

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,450
Take these stewed eggplants we had as leftovers, too.

14
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,920
Mr. Iwai loves this stuff.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,460
As do I.

16
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,180
- May we really?
- Of course.

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,380
Thank you so much.

18
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,770
Must be hard work, being that guy's assistant.

19
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,410
Well, I still have a ways to go.

20
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,770
I wouldn't say that.

21
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,220
Speaking of, where is he?

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,040
He's out on a job.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
That's a good omen.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,250
Next thing it'll rain cats and dogs tomorrow.

25
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,870
Quit raining on our parade.

[Tsukumoyacho - First Year of the Showa Era (1926)]

27
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,110
- A cold?
- If only.

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,940
- What?
- My gut tells me trouble is on the way.

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,050
I only hope I'm wrong...

30
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,010
That's what you get for roping a poor bystander in to clean the shrine again.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,890
You make me sound like a villain.

32
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,240
I told you the Inari shrine was littered, wasn't it?

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,050
Littered with dry leaves.

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,620
I'd say cleaning the area makes you a model police officer.

35
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,090
Get your act together and pay rent already.

36
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,240
I ought to arrest you.

37
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,970
This goddamn chill.

38
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,700
Morning, Gramps.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,140
We're back.

40
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,310
That miso soup smells divine.

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,850
- We have returned.
- Welcome back.

42
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,490
Thank you for your hard work.

43
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,730
Stewed eggplant!

44
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,880
Mr. Iwai!

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,850
Wait for the table to be set.

46
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,170
I worked like a mule today.

47
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,360
Don't lie.

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,050
You're too serious for your own good.

49
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,380
Learn to relax already.

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,540
- Ms. Kanoko, some warm tea please.
- Sure.

51
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,890
Those are two separate matters.

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,550
Make sure you get your nutrients.

53
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,990
Says the man who eats weeds.

54
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,660
Wake up.

55
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,310
Wake up, I say.

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,850
Up!

57
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,980
Mr. Hanasaki, would you like to join us for breakfast?

58
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,850
Thank you, but I shall pass.

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,800
- I'll eat at the office.
- Please do.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,330
We wouldn't have anything for you anyway.

61
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,190
- Sorry, sir...
- You have no need to apologize, Ms. Urabe.

62
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,160
The fault lies in Soma's incompetence and -

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,410
Bye now.

64
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,820
I shall visit again.

65
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,800
- Take care.
- Thank you.

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,890
Let's have breakfast, shall we?

67
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,510
At least put away your basket first...

68
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,890
What's all this?

69
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,300
Stuff I picked up to sell at the pawnshop.

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,580
I see.

71
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,850
I almost forgot. A letter from the landlady came while you were out.

72
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,770
From the landlady?

73
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,930
She wants me to go to her place.

74
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,450
I shall head out after preparing breakfast.

75
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,620
Something she can't tell me, the owner of the place directly...

76
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,960
No, am I finally getting kicked out?

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,100
This is bad!

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,620
But I just cleaned the Inari shrine!

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,980
I knew trouble was on the horizon...

[Usotoki Rhetoric]
[Episode 6]

81
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,030
Found you.

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,950
Okay...

83
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,660
Easy now...

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,060
Kanoko?

85
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,750
Wait up!

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,320
Please, don't run...

87
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,450
- Kanoko!
- What are you doing?

88
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,830
No!

89
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,000
Wait, please!

90
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,590
- That way!
- That way?

91
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,460
- That way!
- T-That way!

92
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,420
Slow and steady...

93
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,580
Smells so good, even the kitty is tempted.

94
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,750
Indeed.

95
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,720
Mr. Iwai?

96
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,340
Where have you been? You could have helped!

97
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,640
Now, Ms. Kanoko.

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,010
- Go!
- Go!

99
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,410
Right!

100
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,520
This cat is definitely the one?

101
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,720
- Yes.
- Glad to hear that.

102
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,250
I would have appreciated any help -

103
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,300
This was a task the landlady asked you to complete, right?

104
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,340
- I suppose.
- And for free?

105
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,210
Yes...

106
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,230
Her neighbor was cat-sitting for their boss, and let the cat slip.

107
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,030
Right, but sir...

108
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,350
If she directed those neighbors to me, this could have been a paying job.

109
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,350
I wonder if the landlady will take this job as next month's rent.

110
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,650
I doubt it, sir.

111
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,850
It's not her cat, after all.

112
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,640
- Say, Ms. Kanoko.
- Yes, sir?

113
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,660
Are those neighbors of hers rich?

114
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,200
Her neighbor's boss is the rich one.

115
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,360
Then we could keep the cat as a hostage,

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,690
and demand ransom money from those bigwigs.

117
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,660
If you do, I'm telling the landlady and Mr. Hanasaki.

118
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,100
Yes, what a terrifying prospect indeed.

119
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,370
I knew it, a catnapping would have made us hit the jackpot...

120
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,930
You're still going on about that, sir?

121
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,430
Chiyo Fujishima...

122
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,960
Ms. Chiyo!

123
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,430
- Mr. Soma, Ms. Kanoko! How do you -
- Nope.

124
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,420
That's just trouble.

125
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,900
Mr. Soma? Please do not run!

126
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,500
Mr. Soma!

127
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,130
Have you seen this man?

128
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,440
"Secrets", "Secrets"!

Yes, sir...

132

Mr. Soma?

133
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,610
Mr. Iwai? What're you doing here?

134
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,070
Now is not the time, really.

135
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,010
There you are, Mr. Soma!

136
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,590
- Mr. Soma!
- Thank you.

137
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,050
Ouch...

138
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,420
Ms. Chiyo!

139
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,290
But sir...

140
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,730
Sorry about that. You alright, miss?

141
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,240
There goes all the pain, right out your nose.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,960
Did I miss a spot?

143
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,950
Are you alright, Ms. Chiyo?

144
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,310
Lemme see.

145
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,610
What?

146
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,460
Right, left,

147
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,880
back, and front.

148
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
Yup, not a scratch in sight.

149
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,130
Well, I'm in a hurry.

150
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,740
Farewell, miss.

151
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,660
Ms. Chiyo, are you able to stand?

152
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,310
Yes, but what ever was the matter with that man?

153
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,290
Do I look that young?

154
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,510
Goodness, I have embarrassed myself in front of Mr. Soma...

155
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,290
Your bag.

156
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,940
Ms. Chiyo.

157
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,330
Your kimono has come slightly undone.

158
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,840
What ever shall I do?

159
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
- Mr. Iwai.
- No.

160
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,110
- I haven't even -
- I refuse.

161
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,350
Sir.

162
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,750
I owe you much, Ms. Kanoko.

163
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,630
It was no trouble.

164
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,000
We're done, sir.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,880
Great.

166
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,760
Though I must say, I am floored!

167
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,900
It is an honor to be welcomed into your office, Mr. Soma.

168
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,420
I never did.

169
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,350
I shall make some tea.

170
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,690
She's probably not thirsty.

171
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,200
I'd love tea.

172
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,170
We only have roasted silvergrass, so I hope that will suffice.

173
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,880
Silvergrass?

174
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,680
I must say, today is full of many firsts for me.

175
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,230
Say, may I take note of your office space?

176
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,460
Oh?

177
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,420
This does not belong to me.

178
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,810
What beautiful craftsmanship.

179
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,590
The individual from earlier must have dropped it.

180
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,340
- This reeks of destiny.
- Pardon?

181
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,950
- Trouble.
- Let us deliver this.

182
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,150
I knew it.

183
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,760
I've read about this sort of happenstance before.

184
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,820
Our protagonist is on the hunt

185
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,120
to find the owner of a lost item.

186
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,530
Yet as they uncover more and more of this mystery person,

187
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,040
they fall madly in love!

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,700
Love?

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,210
The protagonist's efforts also spark a flame within this owner, and...

190
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,910
My, what a romance!

191
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,340
To find clues, trace that trail,

192
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,170
and uncover the hidden truth.

193
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,480
Indeed, this is what being a detective is all about.

194
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,040
- So it's about the romance...
- She just barrels on, doesn't she?

195
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,540
First, we must see what sort of clues lie in this mirror.

196
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,010
I bet that man was a plasterer​.

197
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,570
You were acquainted with this individual?

198
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,170
Not at all. But he had plaster on his right arm, remember?

199
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,790
Did he now?

200
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,690
His towel had a store name embroidered on it too.

201
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,260
"Fujimitsu Plastery" is what it said.

202
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,160
How observant.

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,120
I expected nothing less from you, Mr. Soma.

204
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,910
Then let us make haste.

205
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,920
I don't do work for free.

206
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,560
Mr. Soma...

207
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Besides, you'll be fine if Ms. Kanoko accompanies you.

208
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,010
I suppose we ought to be called the Girls Detective Club then?

209
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,060
Indeed.

210
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,900
I shall enjoy tea another time.

211
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,110
Let us depart, Ms. Kanoko!

212
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,090
R-Right!

213
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,800
Come back before dinner, you hear?

214
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,510
Yes, sir. See you later!

215
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,510
Have fun.

216
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,220
A young lad?

217
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,880
- Yes, sir.
- Yeowch!

218
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,090
Tome's the youngest guy here, right?

219
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,990
- Yeah.
- Then you've got the wrong store.

220
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,170
- Tome, bring us tea.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,300
If he doesn't work for the plasterer...

222
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,440
Then we've run dry of clues.

223
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,470
What a conundrum indeed.

224
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,710
Red hair!

225
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,300
- Red hair?
- Maybe they're talking about Riichi.

226
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,150
Does he have a sort of rattail?

227
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,290
- Yes, that man exactly!
- That guy's not a craftsman here.

228
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,720
He does easy, odd jobs around town.

229
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,260
Says it's 'cause he can't read.

230
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,460
Wasn't he working the mortar with you earlier, Tome?

231
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,790
Yeah. I believe he lives at that store full of knick-knacks

232
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,130
over on Marudera Street.

233
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,520
So his name is Mr. Riichi.

234
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,560
Thank you for the information.

235
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,610
- Let us make haste.
- Yes.

236
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,030
Do we have the right place?

237
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,800
- Excuse us.
- Yes, dears?

238
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,150
Would there happen to be a "Mr. Riichi" here?

239
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,920
Yes, one moment.

240
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,670
Riichi, you've got customers.

241
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,320
Coming.

242
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,910
The ladies from earlier?

243
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,390
- Apologies for intruding.
- Don't be, what's up?

244
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,560
We have come on business, as the Girls Detective Club.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,810
Does this look familiar to you?

246
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,470
Oh hey, I was looking for that!

247
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,800
- It seems like it.
- Thanks for making the delivery -

248
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,180
How very suspicious.

249
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,890
Yes, indeed.

250
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,490
For why would a man have a pocket mirror on hand?

251
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,640
Actually, it's not suspicious at all, Ms. Chiyo.

252
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,440
You cannot deceive this detective, sir.

253
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,420
But he wasn't lying,

254
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,240
he was definitely searching for it.

255
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,840
Ms. Chiyo, this mirror belongs to him.

256
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,220
What?

257
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,460
This mirror was my mother's memento.

258
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,750
Thank you, really.

259
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,550
Huh?

260
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,550
That was a lie.

261
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,310
I've made an insensitive remark.

262
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,890
I'm truly sorry.

263
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,480
An honest apology. Very good.

264
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,040
Please do not treat me like some child.

265
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,520
Ms. Kanoko, let us be off.

266
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,890
R-Right...

267
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,900
Please excuse us.

268
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,870
I crave something sweet.

269
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,900
Riichi, don't munch on food when dealing with customers.

270
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,670
I have to eat it while it's hot.

271
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,800
- Still...
- He lied about that mirror being a memento.

272
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,920
But he wasn't lying when he said he had been searching for it.

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,530
Surely that mirror belongs to him... right?

274
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,490
Are you coming, Ms. Kanoko?

275
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,930
Yes.

276
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,900
I'm starving.

277
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,870
- Welcome.
- Hey, Pops.

278
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,370
- Full house today?
- Yeah, busy day.

279
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,820
- Alright.
- Sorry again.

280
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,610
- Excuse me.
- One grilled fish, coming up.

281
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,600
Could I get seconds?

282
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,240
Yes, right away.

283
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,560
Looks like it's another Tsukumoyaki day for me.

284
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,680
Gramps, two sauce please.

285
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Grannie...

286
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,510
Welcome dear.

287
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,600
Welcome.

288
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,020
Where's Gramps?

289
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,600
We have done a fine job today.

290
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,920
Allow me to treat you

291
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,880
for going along with my antics.

292
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,580
Oh hey, I was looking for that!

293
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,430
This mirror was my mother's memento.

294
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,480
What ever is the matter?

295
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,190
Are you feeling unwell?

296
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,390
- No...
- Is that so?

297
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,420
A snack will perk you right back up.

298
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,660
Shall we partake?

299
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,110
Yes.

300
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,870
- Thank you again.
- Of course.

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,910
Soy sauce, vinegar, and mustard is a must for tokoroten*.
[T/N: a gelatinous side dish/dessert]

302
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,000
The clementines add a nice touch to this mitsumame* as well.
[T/N: dessert; mixture of beans, agar cubes, fruit, and syrup]

303
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,960
A thief got your bag?

304
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,700
Along with my favorite pocket mirror, too.

305
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,870
The silver one?

306
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,240
Yes, it was terrifying.

307
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,210
Thankfully, they tossed my bag aside.

308
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,670
My, what a harrowing experience.

309
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,700
What sort of pocket mirror?

310
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,090
- Pardon?
- We're the Girls Detective Club.

311
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,880
Might you tell us more of this mirror of yours?

312
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,330
We're no one suspicious!

313
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,270
We may have seen this mirror of yours.

314
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,590
It's quite the small thing,

315
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,080
but has a fine emboss of various plants.

316
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,620
That matches the mirror we saw.

317
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,360
The handle is also engraved with the name "TATUE", in English.

318
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,100
Could you write that down for us?

319
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,450
Was there any sort of engraving on the handle?

320
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,840
I'm not sure...

321
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,520
So the inconsistency within his lie...

322
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,610
Can you recall the thief's face?

323
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,310
No, it was all too sudden.

324
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,100
Was that he stole the mirror.

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,040
That mirror is definitely the one.

326
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,030
Yes...

327
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,080
Yes, it must be.

328
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,300
I believe that man is the thief.

329
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,660
Let us visit his place once more, and see for ourselves.

330
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,330
I would never forgive myself if I assisted a common thief.

331
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,230
You're really out of everything?

332
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,610
Yeah, sorry about that.

333
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,330
Looks like I have no choice but to eat this then.

334
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,780
So you do have food to eat.

335
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,520
Gramps was manning the stall in the morning,

336
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,610
so I thought it was a safe day.

337
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,030
But Grannie was the one at the stall when I went.

338
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,180
- So you bought Grannie's recipe?
- Yup.

339
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,120
I've been too scared to eat it,

340
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,440
even though I'm downright starving...

341
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,190
Where's Kanoko?

342
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,900
She's off searching for someone.

343
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,770
Is that right?

344
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,710
Sounds like she's doing more detective work than you are.

345
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,450
She sure is.

346
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,720
That's all you've got to say about it?

347
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,130
Here.

348
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,840
Thank you.

349
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,340
Still, that Kanoko's an absolute waste on you, Mr. Iwai.

350
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,900
I certainly owe a lot to her.

351
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,550
Say, Mr. Iwai.

352
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,010
Hm?

353
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,740
You've got to get yourself out of this poor state, and fast.

354
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,790
It's not like I'm not poor by choice.

355
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,490
Has my unpaid tab finally reached its limit?

356
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,760
That's not my point.

357
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,910
You'd best keep your eye on Kanoko.

358
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,720
Or else she'll find herself a better paying job,

359
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,500
and leave you for them, that's what.

360
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,930
Well we can't have that happen now, can we?

361
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,220
Yeah, especially since you've taken an unusual liking to her.

362
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,280
What?

363
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,790
I mean, you're not one to let someone stay close to you this long.

364
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,440
Make sure to treasure the lass, yeah?

365
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,130
Let us check the mirror, and ask for his mother's name as well.

366
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,920
If he is illiterate, his answer will not match the handle's engraving.

367
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,990
There's no need,

368
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,340
I'll be able to tell either way.

369
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,000
Excuse us.

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,950
My, what brings you ladies back?

371
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,860
Is Mr. Riichi still around?

372
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,000
I just sent him to Cafe Rose, on an errand for Lily.

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,740
Cafe Rose?

374
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,700
Let us make haste.

375
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,170
- See you.
- Thanks again.

376
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,010
Riichi!

377
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,000
Could you lend me a hand?

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,110
Sure thing.

379
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,060
Is Cafe Rose this way?

380
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,400
Yes, we are almost there.

381
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,930
Ms. Kanoko?

382
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,590
Sorry.

383
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,240
Watch it, kid!

384
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,020
Are you alright?

385
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,180
Can you stand?

386
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,680
Yeah.

387
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,020
My pain flew right away.

388
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,650
My, you're a strong lady. How commendable.

389
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,090
Say, where did you get that pocket mirror?

390
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,740
This? My brother gave it to me.

391
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,990
- May I see it?
- No.

392
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,160
I only wish to see it.

393
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,850
This is Mommy's mirror.

394
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,450
My brother told me to treasure it.

395
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,590
This girl...

396
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,600
- She isn't lying.
- I will return it.

397
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,690
- No.
- Yaeko.

398
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,350
Brother!

399
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,610
Hey! Give it back! Give it!

400
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,790
Hold on, have I...

401
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,980
- Ms. Chiyo, that is...
- Give it back, give it back!

402
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,880
Huh? There's no engraving on the handle.

403
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,330
Brother...

404
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,040
Here.

405
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,610
What are you people doing?

406
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,490
What is going on?

407
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,030
I...

408
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,260
I've made an awful mistake.

409
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,400
- We're so sorry.
- We're so terribly sorry.

410
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,090
You thought I was a thief?

411
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,120
We had jumped to conclusions.

412
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,160
Given the circumstances, I guess I'd look pretty darn suspicious.

413
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,690
But an honest apology is the sign of any good kiddo.

414
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,520
I see now.

415
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,800
Your habit of treating us like children is because of your younger sister.

416
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,220
Maybe so.

417
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,620
This here especially reminds me of Yaeko.

418
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,480
See? That, right there.

419
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,120
Come here!

420
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,370
Me?

421
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,760
Play with her, will you?

422
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,540
- Why, of course.
- This way.

423
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,010
Yaeko ain't my younger sister.

424
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,120
She lived above that store of knick-knacks with her mother.

425
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,780
Two years ago,

426
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,480
Yaeko's mother disappeared on her, leaving the kiddo behind.

427
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,960
I took it upon myself to look after her

428
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,430
since the same sorta thing happened to me.

429
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,030
But recently, she's been asking about her mother again.

430
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,830
I had no idea what to tell the kid.

431
00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:00,180
That was when I found the mirror, in a sewer I was cleaning over the summer.

432
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,680
I gave it to Yaeko, saying it belonged to her mother.

433
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,870
So that was why you said it was your mother's...

434
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,090
I was coming back with it from the repair shop today

435
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,590
since Yaeko broke the thing.

436
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,590
Anyhow, that's the story.

437
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,450
Keep it a secret from Yaeko, will you?

438
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,490
I'm so sorry for the mistake.

439
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't be, that ol' thing used to belong to someone else anyway.

440
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,710
Here, chin up.

441
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't take it to heart, yeah?

442
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,020
Yaeko, it's time we head home.

443
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,190
- Brother, look at this!
- People tell all sorts of lies.

444
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,440
They lie out of ill-intent.

445
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,060
For show.

446
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,400
To be considerate.

447
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,440
And...

448
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,020
To keep a secret.

449
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,690
That's Grannie's recipe.

450
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,690
Ms. Kanoko sure is late, isn't she?

451
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,180
We did fine work as detectives today.

452
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,020
Isn't that right, Ms. Kanoko?

453
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,240
While that sounds marvelous, it is past your curfew, my lady.

454
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,230
I'm terribly sorry for causing worry, Mr. Kokichi.

455
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,500
Cheer up, Ms. Kanoko.

456
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,800
Although we made quite the blunder,

457
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,440
we must be glad Mr. Riichi is very forgiving.

458
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,690
Indeed...

459
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,590
My lady, we must be going.

460
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,300
I still have plenty to talk about with Ms. Kanoko.

461
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,130
Perhaps another day.

462
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,730
If you'll excuse us, Ms. Urabe.

463
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,580
My lady.

464
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,200
Please give my regards to Mr. Soma.

465
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,330
Ms. Chiyo misunderstands.

466
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:54,140
I didn't suspect Mr. Riichi, like she had.

467
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,490
Instead, I made an assumption.

468
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,180
I had assumed he was guilty, upon hearing his lie.

469
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:14,290
I can detect the lies people tell.

470
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,750
Yet that is exactly why there are things I've become blind to.

471
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:25,300
[Iwai Detective Agency]

472
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,250
Mr. Iwai...

473
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,500
Mr. Iwai.

474
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:24,150
Am I truly allowed to be a detective's assistant?

475
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,710
Am I worthy enough to be at your side?

476
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,490
All my life, this ability of mine

477
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,990
has only come to hurt others.

478
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,500
My father bought this doll for me.

479
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,450
You're lying!

480
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,740
- Kimi, you're lying again.
- I'm not!

481
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,310
I'm not lying.

482
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,440
I'm not!

483
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,550
Kimi!

484
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,540
You forgot your hat!

485
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,380
- There!
- Oh my!

486
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,050
You've gotten much better at that, haven't you?

487
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,680
I have to get going.

488
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,100
It's too bad. You only just arrived home...

489
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,230
Sorry. I don't know when I'll be back again.

490
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,930
Work has gotten busy, you see.

491
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,480
Uncle, you're lying!

492
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,220
And since you're lying, you can stay home with Kimi.

493
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,930
Is that true, Father?

494
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,600
- Father?
- Kimi.

495
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,620
Let's play over there with Grandma, okay?

496
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,200
Kanoko exposed his lie to the whole family.

497
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,050
It seems he had a lover elsewhere.

498
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,840
He was married into the wive's family, right?

499
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,570
I hear it became a whole ordeal over there.

500
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,190
We're so terribly sorry.

501
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,050
Do not step foot near our home, nor Kimiko ever again!

502
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,600
Yes ma'am, I am so sorry.

503
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,210
My daughter still hasn't woken up from the shock of it all!

504
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,630
I'm so sorry, Kimi's grandmother!

505
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,900
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,030
- I'm so sorry.
- Kanoko...

507
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,700
So what if you can detect lies? Devil's child!

508
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,990
We are so sorry for the trouble.

509
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,250
That was when I finally understood what my powers were capable of.

510
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,180
Mother...

511
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,380
The only way to avoid hurting others

512
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,490
was to stay alone.

513
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,210
So I made an effort to stay alone, without speaking to anyone,

514
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,890
because that was all I could do.

515
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,240
- And even then...
- He did it.

516
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,670
It wasn't me.

517
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,860
Believe me, sir. I'm telling the truth.

518
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,790
- Then who did?
- I couldn't just stand by

519
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,540
and watch people lie,

520
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,340
while they placed the blame on others.

521
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,540
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

522
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,840
Really?

523
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,270
Are you telling the truth?

524
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,110
He's lying.

525
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,740
She spoke.

526
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,970
- Creepy.
- Matsuo is lying.

527
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,190
We need to talk, young man.

528
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,940
Mother...

529
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,020
Welcome home, Kanoko.

530
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,550
[Leave our village]

531
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,270
So long as I have this ability of mine,

532
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,470
it's only obvious people ostracize me.

533
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,110
I won't forgive you.

534
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,200
I can't believe you'd spread my secret.

535
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,910
You told everyone I'm receiving aid for my tuition.

536
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,930
What are you talking about?

537
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,590
I never told anyone anything.

538
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,650
Really?

539
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,760
But that's what I heard.

540
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,000
Lies!

541
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,110
She says I'm lying.

542
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,200
How terrifying.

543
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,810
Kimi, it wasn't me.

544
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm telling the truth!

545
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,120
You're telling the truth?

546
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,830
How do we know you're not lying?

547
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,610
Kimi!

548
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,230
Must be nice.

549
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,650
You can hear our lies,

550
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,510
but no one can hear yours.

551
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,490
Right.

552
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,290
I ought to just lie.

553
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,840
I should lie, and keep all this a secret.

554
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,610
I'll leave the village,

555
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:47,720
and live my life pretending I can't hear these lies.

556
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,640
Promise me you'll stay in good health, Kanoko.

557
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,860
I will.

558
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,920
I'll make sure to send word via letter once I settle down.

559
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,060
Write as soon as you do so, and not a moment later.

560
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,150
I know I've caused you a lot of trouble growing up.

561
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,440
But I have a better handle on my ability now.

562
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,240
I promise I'll be fine.

563
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes, I'm coming.

564
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,280
There, there now.

565
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
Thank goodness.

566
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,550
I'm glad my mother can't hear lies like I do.

567
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,030
If anything, with this skill of mine,

568
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,070
no bad folk will get the best of me.

569
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,900
So...

570
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,030
This power isn't all bad.

571
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,130
I promise I'll be fine out there, Mother.

572
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:52,560
I now understand why my mother hugs me

573
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,880
without a word.

574
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,140
It's because she's afraid.

575
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,920
She's afraid that a lie will be mixed in to her words,

576
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,340
and that I'll pick up on them.

577
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,120
After leaving my village,

578
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,930
I lied, and kept these powers to myself.

579
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,370
I vowed never to hurt another soul with this ability again.

580
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,110
But then I met Mr. Iwai,

581
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:28,020
and I realized my ability could help people.

582
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,830
I was happy.

583
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,710
This means your powers can't verify any unknown factors.

584
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,320
You'd best keep that in mind, if you're to be my assistant.

585
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,450
Mr. Iwai made that fact clear.

586
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:50,620
Yet I almost hurt someone again despite it.

587
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,020
Ms. Kanoko.

588
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,250
It's me.

589
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,620
Mr. Iwai?

590
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,350
The Hannya mask depicts jealousy and envy.

591
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,230
Come again?

592
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,730
It seems you don't get it.

593
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,840
First, eat this.

594
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,350
Eat up.

595
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,470
Amazing, right?

596
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,200
Amazingly horrible.

597
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,020
- Yes, sir.
- Grannie was manning the stand today.

598
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,030
- Erm...
- You know, Ms. Kanoko.

599
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,780
Yes, sir.

600
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,080
I visited the Fujishima residence earlier

601
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,130
because you still hadn't returned to the office.

602
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,380
What?

603
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,530
You only left my magnifying glass behind. Of course I'd worry.

604
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,600
And while I was there, I asked about this afternoon.

605
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,550
So...

606
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,760
I hear you had a nice bowl of mitsumame today.

607
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,070
Pardon?

608
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,330
Ms. Kanoko, why?

609
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,320
Mitsumame?

610
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,810
Why do you get to enjoy mitsumame,

611
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,960
while I was waiting, worried sick, with only a nasty Tsukumoyaki

612
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,670
to satiate me?

613
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,050
- Huh?
- And that is why I am here, looking for you with this mask.

614
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:51,950
Hence the jealousy and envy...

615
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,990
I had a feeling today would be nothing but trouble.

616
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,340
So?

617
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,520
What really happened?

618
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,190
From the looks of it, you're worrying yourself in circles again.

619
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,420
We've sat here to look at the moon before.

620
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,200
Remember?

621
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,540
I wouldn't forget it for the world.

622
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,980
Because your words that night made me so happy.

623
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,400
Sir...

624
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,000
I've decided I will no longer be your assistant.

625
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,650
I don't want to cause him any more trouble.

626
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,010
Today...

627
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,420
I made a mistake in judgement.

628
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,920
I almost hurt someone deeply.

629
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,830
There are things I've become blind to,

630
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,780
because I can detect lies.

631
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,570
And I know, deep down...

632
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,500
I will hurt someone eventually.

633
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,040
This ability of mine is not something to use for a profession.

634
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,850
I've always hated being alone.

635
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,810
But that's what was needed of me all along.

636
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,500
Even if you quit, you'll still hear those lies.

637
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,460
Yes.

638
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,810
- I'll simply ignore -
- Nope.

639
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,690
- I'll ignore-
- Not happening.

640
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,430
- I'll -
- You're asking the impossible.

641
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,910
How would you know?

642
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,230
Because you couldn't ignore Taro, Kaoru, or Shinako.

643
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,380
You had to say something.

644
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,790
Hence, impossible.

645
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,190
Even so, it's something I must do.

646
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,200
I don't want this power to hurt people.

647
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,990
I'm sick of it all.

648
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,460
Okay.

649
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,850
If anything, I practically forced you to become my assistant.

650
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:51,240
I wasn't exactly paying a salary either.

651
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,940
You might be better off working elsewhere after all.

652
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,590
He lied.

653
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,680
Farewell.

654
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,730
I'm the one who rejected him.

655
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:14,830
Mr. Iwai has never once disapproved of my power.

656
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,330
Yet I made him lie.

657
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,430
I...

658
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,430
I've...

659
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,490
I've hurt him?

660
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,970
You'll be fine if Ms. Kanoko accompanies you.

661
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,620
See?

662
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,140
A person who deeply hurts when others are hurting

663
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,350
could never ignore someone in pain.

664
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,010
Now resign to your fate.

665
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,920
- But...
- Alright.

666
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,700
Listen up, Ms. Kanoko.

667
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,010
If there's something you're blind to because you hear lies,

668
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,450
then it's something I'd be privy to, as someone who can't, no?

669
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,540
You're allowed to stay.

670
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,590
Mr. Iwai...

671
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,280
Let's go home.

672
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,800
Yes, sir.

673
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,030
I heard your stomach growling, Ms. Kanoko.

674
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,880
But I'm the one who's really starving, got that?

675
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,970
Sorry, sir.

676
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,000
All my life, I have been alone.

677
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,200
I always believed the solution to not being alone,

678
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,830
was to be allowed by someone's side.

679
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,440
Achoo!

680
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,600
Sir, should I give you back your coat?

681
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,270
It's fine. I just sense more trouble...

682
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,660
- Huh?
- Welcome home, Kanoko.

683
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,000
Good evening.

684
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,980
You forgot to lock up again.

685
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,850
Even if I may never believe in myself,

686
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,010
I am able to believe in Mr. Iwai.

687
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,600
And so, I finally feel like I understand

688
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,540
what it truly means to "not be alone".

689
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,810
Hungry?

690
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,200
Yes,sir.

691
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,090
[To be continued]

692
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,410
A Haunted Manor?
[The Haunted Manor of 33rd Street]

693
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,870
It's said to be haunted by a ghost.
[The Haunted Manor of 33rd Street]

694
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,320
- Let's go, Ms. Kanoko.
- Go, where?

695
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,530
To find us a ghost.

696
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,430
A ghost?
[The murderer is a ghost?]
Don't scream.
[The murderer is a ghost?]

697
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,980
If you do...
[The murderer is a ghost?]

698
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,360
The identity of this woman lies within the Haunted Manor.
[Uncover the lies hidden within this ghostly activity!]

699
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,630
Who is this?

700
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,390
- A ghost!
- The correct answer is... Mr. Iwai!

701
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,920
This is me?

702
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,100
This is you, isn't it?

703
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,590
His sketch is so realistic, it's terrifying.

704
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,780
It's almost as if someone's will was pulling the strings.

705
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,130
It's sort of cold.

706
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,450
I'm starting to get chills.
