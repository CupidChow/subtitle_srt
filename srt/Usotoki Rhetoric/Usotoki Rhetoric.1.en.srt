Just relax, and eat your fill.

178
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,640
Hypocritical bum.

179
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,900
I'm just speaking for Pops while he's busy cooking.

180
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,660
<i>It's so homely here.</i>

181
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,890
- <i>These people speak to one another as they would a friend.</i>
- Thank you.

182
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,070
<i>And the meals they serve... warm me to the core.</i>

183
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,780
He owes me that much? Damn.

184
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,780
- Do you feel no shame, taking advantage of such kind people?
- <i>These people are honest folk.</i>

185
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,740
<i>How nice.</i>

186
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,250
<i>They're all cheery, and clearly get along.</i>

187
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,110
<i>If only my own life was like this.</i>

188
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,160
- I'm home.
- Welcome back, Taro.

189
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Thank you for grabbing those groceries.

190
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,300
I'll take those.

191
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,560
Running errands? Good going, Taro.

192
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,690
Here to eat free meals again?

193
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,000
- Taro, I'll teach you a lesson.
- Yeah?

194
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,170
Nothing's more expensive than something you get for free.

195
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,470
Says you.

196
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,880
Oh?

197
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,250
Taro, did you get any more change? I'm not counting enough.

198
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,680
That's all I got.

199
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,810
- <i>No...</i>
- That damn Rokuhei, taking my kid for a fool.

200
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,290
This means business.

201
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,340
Dear, I'm sure it was only a mistake.

202
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,020
No.

203
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,750
You shouldn't lie like that.

204
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,780
People will lose their trust in you,

205
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,170
and you'll be making a villain of that innocent storeowner, too.

206
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,130
What?

207
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,010
You should never lie to make someone else the bad guy.

208
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,850
- Miss.
- Ms. Urabe, I wouldn't be so hasty.

209
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,960
We cannot say for sure the boy has lied yet.

210
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,510
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,080
I... see.

212
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,420
Taro!

213
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

214
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,140
Thought you could best me?

215
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,310
Dear, there are customers!

216
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,020
- Come with me, son.
- Dear!

217
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,610
- What are you doing? Get the rag!
- I'm so terribly sorry, sirs!

218
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,730
- Ma'am!
- Yes?

219
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,340
Ma'am...

220
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,990
What's the matter?

221
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,950
Did you get new table kerchiefs?

222
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,720
Is now really the time?

223
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,840
Yes, we needed new ones.

224
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,170
Soma, I swear I'm putting you behind bars.

225
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,350
<i>What have I done?</i>

226
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,470
Taro. Go upstairs.

227
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,930
Folks...

228
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,980
I'm so sorry.

229
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,440
<i>Kanoko was being weird again.</i>

230
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,640
<i>See ya, Monster!</i>

231
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,400
<i>The girl can't even take a joke.
- What a real pain, that one.</i>

232
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,090
<i>She's so creepy. Creepy.</i>

233
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,590
<i>I've made everyone miserable with my ability. Again.</i>

234
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,400
Thank you for the meal. I must get going.

235
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,860
Kanoko?

236
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,040
Good night.

237
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,230
<i>I've had it with my power.</i>

238
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,760
You ought to stay the night.

239
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,430
I'll take shelter at the shrine.

240
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,010
Why? You've got nothing to apologize for.

241
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,580
Besides, I hear wild dogs are running amok up there.

242
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,780
We promise you're no bother at all.

243
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,420
The fault is Taro's, not yours.

244
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,380
Stay with our Sleuth tonight.

245
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,250
No, I mustn't. Sorry again for the ruckus I've caused.

246
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,770
At least finish your meal before you go.

247
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,860
And hey, my place is right there.

248
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,310
Though it might be messy, I've got a clear guest room on the second floor.

249
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,430
- Don't I?
- That, he does.

250
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,410
You have no need to brave the outdoors, really.

251
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,730
Now, come back in and have a seat.

252
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,890
There you go.

253
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,370
Feel free to come back for breakfast as well, dear.

254
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,160
Score! Thanks a million.

255
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,370
You ought to learn some humility.

256
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,050
Taro. I said upstairs.

257
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,560
Come on, Pops. I think Taro's reflected on his actions plenty.

258
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,700
Don't be too hard on him, alright?

259
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,100
Remember, he has his side of the story too.

260
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,720
Yes, sir.

261
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,230
- Sorry for the ruckus.
- Pops?

262
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,110
- I know, I know.
- Wrong. I'm asking for seconds.

263
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,470
- Seconds?
- Learn humility, indeed.

264
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,850
Thanks for dinner, Pops.

265
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,980
Take care now.

266
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,620
- See you tomorrow.
- You must be exhausted.

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,000
Take care, and rest plenty.

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,430
That is, if there's even room to stretch your legs.

269
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,880
Rude. Don't worry, the guest room is clean.

270
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,010
- Ms. Urabe, do not hesitate to call the police -
- Good night.

271
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,900
Then I shall leave you two.

272
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,210
Thank you for your help today.

273
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,350
My place is close. Follow me.

274
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,670
Here we are.

275
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,060
See? Told you so.

276
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,530
- "Iwai".
- Huh?

277
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,790
You were wondering how that was read, right?

278
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,650
It's my name. "Soma Iwai".

279
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,440
Oops, I forgot to lock the door -

280
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,910
- A-Are you alright?
- Come on in.

281
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,560
And close the door.

282
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,900
- How about we eat out tonight?
- Really?

283
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,670
Then we can actually chat a bit.

284
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,600
That sounds wonderful.

285
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,050
- Good evening.
- Evening.

286
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,480
She was whisked away because you wouldn't make your move, Mr. Moto.

287
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,360
Oh, Maria!

288
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,000
Without you, this place is full of hags and nothing more!

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,030
- What? Rude.
- You're a withering old man yourself.

290
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,740
I hear Maria left the place without a word to any of you ladies?

291
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,100
Of course not, she would never.

292
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,210
- That's what Rosanne said.
- I did not.

293
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,530
Don't you lie to me now!

294
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,150
Oh goodness, he'll kill me! Help!

295
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,870
He'll kill me, I say!

296
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,210
- Ouch!
- Are you alright?

297
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,160
Watch your step.

298
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,650
I've seriously got to clean up already...

299
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,390
Are <i>you</i> alright, Mr. Iwai?

300
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,800
- No.
- Huh?

301
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,140
Did something happen?

302
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,120
She cut off my electricity.

303
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,460
W-What?

304
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,790
It was only a matter of time. I wasn't paying my bills, after all -

305
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,550
One moment.

306
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,160
<i>[Iwai Detective Agency]</i>

307
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,350
Mr. Iwai, are you perhaps dirt po -

308
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,820
Do private detectives not receive much work?

309
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,620
Found it.

310
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,510
Listen up, Kanoko Urabe.

311
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,220
Yes, sir.

312
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,150
Have you ever once in your life thought,

313
00:20:53,150 --> 00:21:00,230
"My, I sure could use a private detective right about now"?

314
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,700
- No, sir.
- Exactly.

315
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,020
Most people don't.

316
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,840
Which means detectives rarely get any work.

317
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,480
I wish people were lining up outside my door.

318
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,420
- I wish I had lines for days -
- Sir, calm down!

319
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,210
In any case, that's that.

320
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,230
Don't worry about water. There's a well out front.

321
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,050
These weeds are edible...

322
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,050
- Here.
- Thank you.

323
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,540
The guest room's the one all the way to the back.

324
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,030
Watch your step.

325
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,870
The stairs are especially messy.

326
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,460
Will do...

327
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,000
Well then, good night.

328
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,230
Good night.

329
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,460
Say...

330
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,870
How'd you catch onto Taro?

331
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,040
How did you know he was lying?

332
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,040
It was only a hunch.

333
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,830
<i>I lied.</i>

334
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,050
A hunch?

335
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,220
And here I thought you caught on like I did.

336
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,260
Nothing. Good night.

337
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,010

Mrs. Kurata!

362
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,900
Where's your husband?

363
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,730
He's searching across the river.

364
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,900
And we're certain no one saw him around these parts?

365
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,410
Absolutely, we've been looking all morning.

366
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,530
- So have I.
- Can it.

367
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,480
"Can it"? Learn some respect, you son of a gun!

368
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,430
- I'm back.
- Mr. Noppe!

369
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,460
Dear!

370
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,600
- Did you find him?
- He wasn't by the station.

371
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,090
I see. Then maybe he's by the piers.

372
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,760
- The piers?
- I'll go check.

373
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,690
Great, thanks.

374
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,610
Goodness, where did that boy go?

375
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,480
We'll find him, Ma'am. Stay strong.

376
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,080
Your help means the world, thank you.

377
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,690
Of course.

378
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,520
Have you tried contacting the school?

379
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,720
You absolute buffoon. It's a Sunday!

380
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,170
Right, sorry.

381
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,600
Taro will be fine, he's a strong lad.

382
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,180
- Indeed.
- Stay strong, Ma'am.

383
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,800
Where else would Taro go?

384
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,540
Excuse me, did something happen to Taro?

385
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,790
Truth be told, he wasn't in his room this morning.

386
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,830
None of us have seen the boy either.

387
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,330
Maybe he got caught up in something bad?

388
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,420
This is no joking matter, you dunce.

389
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,640
Go home already.

390
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,250
I'll help search for him.

391
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,120
Who was that?

392
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,980
Taro?

393
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,170
Maybe he's over there.

394
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,560
Taro?

395
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,180
- Mr. Iwai?
- Good morning, Kanoko Urabe.

396
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,340
What are you doing?

397
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,860
Gramps, are you almost done?

398
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:35,310
I can't believe you've made me open shop bright and early...

399
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,270
Mr. Iwai, Taro has gone missing!

400
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,780
Which means I'm not getting breakfast at the Kurata's today.

401
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,580
This may be my fault.

402
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,980
- One seaweed, and one glazed mochi please.
- Yeah, yeah.

403
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,310
- If I only I didn't...
- Hm?

404
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,840
If only I didn't run my mouth yesterday...

405
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,790
- Now, now.
- Please let me go!

406
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,700
Follow me.

407
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,170
Gramps, I'm in a hurry. Put it on the tab.

408
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,640
- Again?
- This way.

409
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,020
You know where Taro went?

410
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,580
Probably.

411
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,790
Seems like you really hadn't caught on.

412
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,000
Coming...

413
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,430
Good morning.

414
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,550
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

415
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,950
Have you checked the nearest station?

416
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,090
- Morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,460
- Morning.
- Understood.

418
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,690
We'll call if we have any update on our end.

419
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,820
- Great, thank you.
- Sergeant Hanasaki.

420
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,630
We received report this morning of a child that has gone missing.

421
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,960
- A child?
- Yes, sir.

422
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,770
The child is Tatsuzo and Yoshie Kurata's son, Taro Kurata, age 6.

423
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,230
He was not found in his room this morning,

424
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,960
and his sandals were also missing.

425
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,240
Kurata, of the Kurata Eatery?

426
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,890
Yes, sir.

427
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,430
- Sato, search by the station.
- Yes, sir.

428
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,900
- Okuda, I want you to check the park.
- Understood.

429
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,450
- Ask around for eye-witnesses, anything will help.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,350
- Fujimoto, you're with me to the Kurata Eatery.
- Copy that.

431
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,480
- Let us make haste.
- Yes, sir.

432
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,620
A cat, you say?
<i>[Tsukumoyacho]</i>

433
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,220
Yes, the one you were fighting a fish over.

434
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,000
Taro probably went to check up on it.

435
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,850
- Want one?
- No, thank you.

436
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,500
If I'm on the mark, I think he was keeping the cat at the shrine.

437
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,640
A family working in food service can't keep a cat, let alone a pet.

438
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,170
He must have been feeding it leftovers from his school lunch.

439
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,870
I mean, you saw the evidence.

440
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,980
What evidence?

441
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:51,490
That cat wore a bandanna that had the same pattern as the kerchief the Kurata's used.

442
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,070
A bandanna?

443
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,660
But today is Sunday, which means no school and no leftovers.

444
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,980
Taro wanted to secure some food for the kitty,

445
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,750
which was why he tried to keep some pocket money for himself.

446
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,180
<i>Don't be too hard on him, alright?</i>

447
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,070
<i>Remember, he has his side of the story too.</i>

448
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,770
Is that why you...

449
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,280
- What was that?
- Nothing.

450
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,340
<i>He had already picked up on the reason behind Taro's lie.</i>

451
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,510
<i>That was why he asked the Kurata's to go easy on him.</i>

452
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,620
- <i>"Iwai"</i>.
- <i>Huh?</i>

453
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,300
<i>You were wondering how that was read, right?</i>

454
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,210
<i>He was able to answer me from my line of sight alone.</i>

455
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,840
<i>I didn't even have to speak a word.</i>

456
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,430
<i>He must be very observant of others.</i>

457
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,240
But of course. I am a detective, after all.

458
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,320
<i>See? He could easily tell I was amazed.</i>

459
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,290
Now then, just a bit further.

460
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,040
Right.

461
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,670
Taro left the house last night because he got worried.

462
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,280
He thought the kitty might get attacked by wild dogs.

463
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,910
The very ones Pops mentioned last night.

464
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,410
- Wild dogs?
- Exactly.

465
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,150
Then I'm especially worried for Taro as well.

466
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,800
I doubt there are any wild dogs around.<b>- Pardon?</b>

467
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,940
And I think you'd know.

468
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,940
Because I've certainly heard growling around these parts.

469
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,300
- Me!
- Probably.

470
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,050
Oh, me.

471
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,800
Which is why Taro is here.

472
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,680
Taro?

473
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,470
Someone seems to be up there.

474
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,620
A visitor?

475
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,940
Good morning.
- Morning.

476
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,680
Sir, have you seen a small child wandering this area?

477
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,960
Can't say I have.

478
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,860
Is that so? Thank you, sir.

479
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,570
<i>Huh? Did he just...</i>

480
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,410
What's the matter?

481
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,340
<i>That man knows something.</i>

482
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,200
Woah, where are you going?

483
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,420
Let me go!

484
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,980
That man, he...

485
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,830
- What of that man?
- He...

486
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,490
I can tell.

487
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,680
Tell what, exactly?

488
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:36,090
<i>Creepy. Creepy. Creepy.</i>

489
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,660
I can tell when someone is lying.

490
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,820
That man says he knows nothing, but he's lying.

491
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,710
- What?
- Please, let me go!

492
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,970
You can detect lies?

493
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,710
Yes. I can.

494
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,330
I...

495
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,670
<i>[Monster]</i>

496
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,450
<i>I am...</i>

497
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,640
<i>a monster.</i>

498
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,760
Excuse me...

499
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,790
Excuse me!

500
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,590
What are you doing?

501
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,500
Stay back, it's dangerous around here.

502
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,080
I said, what are you doing?

503
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,680
Yes or no.

504
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,430
Ask him something that can only be answered with yes or no.

505
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,050
Get solid proof that he knows something.

506
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,520
For example...

507
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,570
Hey you!

508
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,610
Isn't there a kid in there?

509
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,000
No, of course not.

510
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,930
Liar!

511
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,950
Mr. Iwai!

512
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,940
Quit meddling!

513
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,440
I've got breakfast for you, Taro.

514
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,400
Mr. Iwai...

515
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,000
Let's split this later, yeah?

516
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,050
I need you to hold your breath for a bit. Got that?

517
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,510
Great job, kiddo.

518
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,200
Mr. Iwai...

519
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,730
Impressive.

520
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,830
Mr. Iwai...

521
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,540
Taro!

522
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,020
Taro, I'm so sorry.

523
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,400
You must have been terrified.

524
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,330
<i>Taro had gone to the Inari shrine</i>

525
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,110
to check on the cat last night.

526
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,350
<i>Except,</i>

527
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,700
he also happened to witness this man burying a body.

528
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,940
Go, run!

529
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,440
<i>The man kept Taro locked up,</i>

530
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,530
<i>and had planned to kill him off as well.</i>

531
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,320
Okay.

532
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,980
Everything's okay now.

533
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,460
That was loud, wasn't it?

534
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,970
It'll all be okay, I promise.

535
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,280
What's wrong now?

536
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,700
My Tsukumoyaki's gone...

537
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,830
"Tsukumoyaki"?

538
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Iwai.

539
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,030
I dropped your mochi.

540
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,590
I suppose that'd happen.

541
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:12,010
Come eat at our place instead.

542
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,620
Nah, I'm not blaming you, Taro.

543
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,370
But since you offered, I think I will.

544
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,410
Taro. Look.

545
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,750
Inari?

546
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,640
Inari!

547
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,210
So that cat's name is Inari.

548
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,350
Say...

549
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,170
Why did you decide to believe me?

550
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,040
<i>Liar!</i>

551
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,930
You dove into that fire,

552
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,960
despite having practically no evidence.

553
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,580
You could have died in there.

554
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,060
That's because I didn't think you were lying.

555
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,760
Someone who is against making a bad guy out of others

556
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,200
would never lie in a situation like that.

557
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,510
The other reason was because

558
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,630
the police may compensate me for a job well done.

559
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,550
I see you seriously believe it.

560
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,030
Thanks.

561
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,630
<i>I'm glad he believed I can detect lies.</i>

562
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,690
<i>I'm glad Taro is safe, too.</i>

563
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,050
<i>Still...</i>

564
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,580
<i>I really didn't want Mr. Iwai</i>

565
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,580
to find out about this skill of mine.

566
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,960
<i>After all,</i>

567
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,140
<i>now he won't treat me</i>like he used to.

568
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,280
<i>He won't see me as a "normal" person ever again.</i>

569
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,080
<i>[Tsukumoyacho Police Department]</i>

570
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,570
<i>I went through what they call a "questioning" at the police department,</i>

571
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,580
<i>and after I told them</i>

572
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:25,550
<i>they explained to me the specifics of this case.</i>

573
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,420
If I may ask, why exactly did you decide to tail that man?

574
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,240
Why did you think

575
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:40,210
I had a sort of hunch,

576
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,260
Thank you for your time.

577
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,070
Once we get your signature downstairs, you're free to go.

578
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,630
<i>The one who was killed by that man,</i>

579
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:07,270
<i>was a waitress who worked for Cafe Rose, named Maria.</i>

580
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,190
Ms. Kiyo Tabuchi, please come on in.

581
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,480
The poor girl.

582
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,010
She was played for a fool by an awful man.

583
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,310
Isn't that right, Madam?

584
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,530
Our livelihood is built on falsehoods.

585
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,590
Yet Maria was murdered, no thanks to another lie.

586
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,820
What an earnest fool she was.

587
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,690
<i>I am able to detect lies.</i>

588
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,010
<i>It's almost like a supernatural power.</i>

589
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:51,040
<i>But I kept the truth behind my abilities a secret from the police.</i>

590
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,430
<i>Mr. Iwai must have kept the secret as well,</i>

591
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,270
since the officers made no note of it."

592
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,350
Taro?

593
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,840
Taro!

594
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,070
You alright? Must've been a rough night.

595
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,600
- Taro?
- Taro!

596
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,780
He's back! Taro's back!

597
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,270
I'll be taking him home.
- Great!

598
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,700
We'll leave you two at that.

599
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,820
The Kurata's are waiting for you both with a feast prepared.

600
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,660
Mr. Iwai...

601
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,700
So you were awake.

602
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,610
Do you think Inari will be okay alone?

603
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,610
Ms. Urabe!

604
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,560
That must have been a harrowing experience. Are you alright?

605
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,320
Yes, I am fine.

606
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,050
That's good to hear.

607
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,530
And Soma?

608
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,250
I believe he's currently taking Taro home.

609
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,240
I see.

610
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,820
Ms. Urabe, is it true?

611
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,530
Will you be leaving town?

612
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,560
Yes, sir.

613
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,240
Was it rough, residing with Soma?

614
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,570
I suppose he is dirt poor.

615
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,430
He cannot clean either.

616
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,980
Yet he feels no shame for his faults,

617
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,080
and is an absolute bum at times.

618
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,930
I wouldn't...

619
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,580
Even so, he isn't a bad man.

620
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,150
He's incredibly observant,

621
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,820
almost to an uncanny degree.

622
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:05,750
Which is why he understands people.

623
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,670
Indeed.

624
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,540
My boss recently had his second child,

625
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,090
and they were looking for a nanny.

626
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,000
I had hoped to introduce you to them.

627
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,860
You wouldn't stay in Soma's garbage heap, of course.

628
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,000
We would arrange an abode for you.

629
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,220
- Sir...
- You should stay here, in our humble Tsukumoyacho.

630
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,810
Although...I suppose that doesn't sound appealing,

631
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,990
considering what just happened to you.

632
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:50,940
But this town is a good one, I guarantee it.

633
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:00,050
Thank you, sir. But I have places I must be heading to.

634
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,700
<i>With this ability of mine,</i>

635
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,380
<i>I should be able to avoid most immediate dangers.</i>

636
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,160
<i>That is why...</i>

637
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,470
<i>I'll head someplace new, where no one knows me.</i>

638
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,610
<i>These weeds are edible...</i>

I feel bad for Mommy.

Taro! How could you?

650
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,230
You don't feel bad for Daddy?

651
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,390
Did the police finish badgering you?

652
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,640
You're certainly carrying some baggage.

653
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,430
Did the police give you a hefty reward?

654
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,080
No.

655
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,740
Rather, what are <i>you</i> doing?

656
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,790
Mr. Hanasaki was looking for you -

657
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,290
- There, eat it while it's hot.
- Thank you.

658
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,070
I'm working off this morning's tab.

659
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,280
Besides, I don't want him nagging me for another unpaid meal.

660
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:48,490
Kaoru said he wanted to recommend you as a potential nanny.

661
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:54,050
Yes, I just turned down his offer.

662
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,010
Thought you would.

663
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,710
I could never let him introduce you to his boss,

664
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:04,610
especially with those powers of yours.

665
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,510
After all...

666
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,470
You're better off working for me.

667
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,670
- Pardon?
- Not that I have much to offer in terms of a salary, though.

668
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,760
- Erm...
- I mean, come on.

669
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,210
You can detect lies? That's incredibly useful for a detective.
- "Useful"?

670
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:31,640
With your powers, and my *<i>cough</i>*...

671
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,470
With your powers, and my *<i>cough</i>*...

672
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,290
And your what?

673
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,810
Hot! Never mind the details.

674
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,330
Together, we could help so many people.

675
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,890
<i>My power could...</i>

676
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,480
And we could make absolute bank.

677
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
<i>...help people?</i>

678
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,050
I...

679
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,420
Yes?

680
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,230
I'd like to stay with you folks, if I could.

681
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,050
But...

682
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,640
But?

683
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,400
<i>Creepy. Creepy. Creepy.</i>

684
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,190
What's stopping you from staying?

685
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,020
Is it how broke I am?

686
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,930
Or maybe... how broke I am?

687
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,690
Because I'm definitely short on money.

688
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:32,030
Stop teasing me.

689
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,650
I mean...

690
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,140
Mr. Iwai.

691
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:48,210
You don't feel...

692
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,000
disturbed, having me around?

693
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,440
Not at all.

694
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,320
I'm an honest man, after all.

695
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,630
That was a lie, wasn't it?

696
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,280
Busted.

697
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,740
<i>Huh?</i>

698
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,140
<i>Just now, he...</i>

699
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,630
<i>Not at all.</i>

700
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,770
And you know that, right?

701
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,640
Because you can tell I'm not lying.

702
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,310
Are you alright?

703
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,220
Watch where you are going!

704
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,740
How absolutely clumsy you have been.

705
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,030
Do you hope to make a murderer of our wonderful chauffeur?

706
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,880
- Enough of that, Chiyo.
- Sir!

707
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,310
I apologize for my daughter's crude...

708
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,430
Crude attitude.

709
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,560
Are you unharmed?

710
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,320
Yes, sir.
