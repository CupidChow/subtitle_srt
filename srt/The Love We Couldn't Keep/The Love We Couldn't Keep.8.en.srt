19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,560
Promise me that

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,040
you can't fall for anyone else!

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,880
Weiwei,

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,720
why you hit people?!

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Mother,

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
why are you here all of a sudden?

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
With the help of Jiang Mi this season,

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,320
our firm has turned around completely!

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,880
What does 'turn around' mean?

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,720
It's about a return to the peak,

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,840
sweeping the nation.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,080
If there were no more bonuses, it'd be unfair!

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,360
Absolutely unfair!

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
By the way, Li,

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
you can secure your job for sure.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
When you're in,

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,280
never forget to have meals with us.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
Alright.

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,640
As for where to eat, it's all up to you.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
Li is truly the most

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
worry-free intern I've ever had.

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,680
Li, what did you take?

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
It's a home-made thing.

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,280
I just thought I'd have it for lunch.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,520
Li, I never thought

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
you can cook yourself!

45
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,440
It seems you've made quite a lot!

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
I brought a share for the Director, too.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
Li, I have high hopes for you!

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Sure!

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm leaving.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm heading out now.

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,040
(How could this happen)

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
I've texted you.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
Besides, you didn't even close the door.

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,320
Although there are two guys at home,

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,200
it may not be safe.

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Hello, Auntie.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,960
It should be more affectionate!

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,680
For example, like auntie,

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,640
or mother...

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,490
Mother!

62
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,470
It's not your turn!

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,960
I just saw everything.

64
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
About what happened,

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,320
that was just an accident.

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
It's all my fault.

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,720
I lost my patience.

68
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,360
A misunderstanding.

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
I've gone through it.

70
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,120
I can see it through that

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
have you quarreled?

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,480
Relax, and I'll stand up for you.

73
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,360
Okay.

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
Weiwei,

75
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,160
you've never been taught to hit people.

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,540
How can you do that?

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
I...

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
Boy, you

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,320
look quite pretty.

80
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,480
Are you one of our natives?

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
Auntie, you said it.

82
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm an intern under Weiwei.

83
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,040
You must be much younger than her!

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes!

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,680
But the age issue doesn't matter.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,760
Come on, add each other on WeChat!

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Of course, yes.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Director, time to eat!

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,880
Director, it's time to eat!

90
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm not hungry.

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
Get it out of here.

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
Your mother will be concerned if so.

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Please have a bit.

94
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,680
He worked hard to cook.

95
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You need to have them all.

96
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,920
Come on, have more.

97
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
Come and have a taste!

98
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Thank you.

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,320
No need to do it since tomorrow.

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
Why?

101
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,280
I was told by your mother.

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,720
She knew nothing!

103
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
And many guys are watching us here.

104
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,440
Both of us will be framed.

105
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
Alright.

106
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,160
I understand.

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
By the way,

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
on top of work stories,

109
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,400
you can't get in and out as you wish.

110
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,320
Did I do something wrong?

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
Or,

112
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,120
you're sick of me now?

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,080
No!

114
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,760
Director!

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
Why did you get him upset again?

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
I...

117
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
I...

118
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,560
It's not the way you look at it.

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,480
Because I failed her.

120
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,960
You can't blame her.

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,160
Then, you guys keep going.

122
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Never forget your meal.

123
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
For a newcomer,

124
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,360
he's already doing very well.

125
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
Don't be too strict with him!

126
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
Director.

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Sing it!

128
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Brother...

129
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,880
Can you fix an appointment with Li Shu?

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
I want him.

131
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,840
Do it yourself!

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,520
I failed, so I came for your help!

133
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,000
He's unwilling to see you, that means

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
he really doesn't want you!

135
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,390
I...

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,960
I know that.

137
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,240
I chose to team up with Qingyu because

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,520
I could take more chances to see him.

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
I never thought

140
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,080
he's so businesslike!

141
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,360
(Dinner tonight?)
He didn't care!

142
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,160
You're a fairy-like girl.

143
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
You should know when to give up.

144
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
Negative!

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
I must face the challenge!

146
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,040
Brother, please!

147
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
When you were in college,

148
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,640
I asked him to take care of you.

149
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
I made a mistake.

150
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes.

151
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,360
So you should hold me all accountable!

152
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,480
Li Shu is determined.

153
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,160
He won't fall in love with you.

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
Is it the way you treat your sister?

155
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,500
(Qu Wan'er)

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
Give me your phone.

157
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,720
- Why?
- Give it to me.

158
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,820
(Qu Wan'er)

159
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Brother.

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
It turns out you love Qu Wan'er!

161
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Why don't we work together?

162
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
I can do it myself.

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,240
Yes, you can!

164
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm sure you'll have no

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
life-long companion!

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,360
When did you block me?

167
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
I never thought the decisive Tang Weiwei

168
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,320
could be disturbed by an intern.

169
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,120
Now, my mom is getting involved, too!

170
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,720
It becomes more complex.

171
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,200
I think you do have feelings for him.

172
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,160
If so, just give it a try.

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
You can't just because of a bad past,

174
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,520
staying single for a lifetime!

175
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Let's talk about it later.

176
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,700
(The Additional Clauses)

177
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,320
Mr. Jiang wants to amend it.

178
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,760
Did I offend him before?

179
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
Why won't he let me go in this life?

180
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Do you think Mr. Jiang

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
has feelings for you?

182
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Negative, and don't curse me!

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,840
How can this be considered cursing you?

184
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,200
Mr. Jiang is the CEO of Jiang Media.

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
About the immense wealth,

186
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
when it comes, you better catch it!

187
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't. Whoever wants it can have it.

188
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Weiwei,

189
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,720
I really

190
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,920
really love you!

191
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
As long as you're willing to admit it,

192
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,120
I can forgive.

193
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
Admit what?

194
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,120
You're absolutely ridiculous!

195
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,960
You don't believe me, do you?

196
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Alright.

197
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Let's break up!

198
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Break up?

199
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
It was your fault.

200
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
But you want to break up with me?

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,840
My fault?

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
Truly unreasonable!

203
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,580
(Attraction, Trust, Like, Love, Destruction)

204
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,140
(Tang Weiwei hates thunderstorms)

205
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Why are you here?

206
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,200
I...

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Thunderstorms frighten me!

208
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,520
Come in now!

209
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,360
Alright.

210
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,760
I haven't apologized to you about

211
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,480
what happened before.

212
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
What?

213
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,440
We're not a couple.

214
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
But I kissed you in advance.

215
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,400
It's okay.

216
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,680
It's a thing of the past.

217
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,120
I know that

218
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,960
a five-year age gap lies between us.

219
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,960
Sometimes, you think I'm too young and

220
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
are sick of my immaturity.

221
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,520
But I really love you.

222
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,840
I... I also really love you.

223
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,280
I don't want to deceive myself.

224
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,200
But we can't be a couple.

225
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,640
Sister, do you love me?

226
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,560
Why can't we be a couple?

227
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,560
I haven't figured out how to tell you

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,040
about some things yet.

229
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
It's okay.

230
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm willing to wait till you figure it out.
