=The Love We Couldn't Keep=

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,080
Last night, you left me alone

19
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,040
=Episode 6=
on the curb.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,160
Do you know whom I hit with a bottle

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,080
for you last night?

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,280
Miss Jiang is here.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,520
Miss Jiang.

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,410
We meet again.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,800
Good day!

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
You'd have a pretty tight schedule.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,640
I might have to trouble you a bit.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Where is Li Shu?

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,200
Why is there no one else?

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,840
You thought less of me!

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,360
I specifically took leave here!

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,000
During today's filming,

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,920
if you have any questions,

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,600
you can communicate with our staff.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,080
They are very professional, too.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,200
It won't be long for Li Shu to be here.

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Really?

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
Where is the makeup room?

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Lv, take Miss Jiang to the makeup room.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
This way, please.

41
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Thank you for your effort.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,520
I feel I'm gonna be snowed under.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,080
Definitely!

44
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,450
I don't want these things.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,920
Baby, what's wrong?

46
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,120
Look at those lines on your face!

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,240
It's not looking good.

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
You have the heat turned up too high.

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,880
I can't even stand it!

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
Sorry, it's our fault.

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,800
Lv, turn down the air conditioning for her.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Stop shooting. I'm in a bad mood.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Miss Jiang!

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,080
As for Li Shu,

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
he worked overtime last night.

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,720
He's on the way to the studio.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,920
If he comes later,

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll ask him to be with you.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Will that make you feel a bit happier?

61
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,400
Really?

62
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,800
How much longer until he arrives?

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
He should be here soon

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll hurry him up.

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
What's the makeup artist waiting for?

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,200
Hurry up and start the makeup!

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
Lv, come quickly!

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,560
Should we fix the hair a bit more?

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,880
You need to

70
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
keep an eye on the studio.

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
I'll reach Li Shu.

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,760
Isn't Li Shu unwilling to come?

73
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
He has no other choice but to come.

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Jiang Mi is available for only eight hours.

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,400
Plus, the time for makeup and hair,

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,320
it's simply not enough.

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,240
Jiang Mi is a pretty girl.

78
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,840
Why is her mind full of Li Shu?

79
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Forget it. Just do your part!

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,840
Hey, Li!

81
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,530
Come over to the studio!

82
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,880
Director, you wanted me?

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,160
You know Jiang Mi is on the set today.

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,120
To have her to be part of our project,

85
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,160
I need you to be her assistant,

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
being with her all day long.

87
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
To be her assistant?

88
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Look, I've done

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,080
the early stages of what I should do.

90
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,120
For her shooting, I'd better

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
not be part of it.

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,920
I know that.

93
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
But the reality is

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
you're needed.

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
Well...

96
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Ok.

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
I just want you

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
to repeat what you spoke of.

99
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
What?

100
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,160
Just say you love me again.

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,000
When did I ever say

102
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,520
I love you?

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,280
You're arguing!

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Let's go!

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
Sister, I'll show you something.

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,560
Come a little closer to me!

107
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,640
(Sister's evidence)
Why got drunk again?

108
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,560
Did I really upset you?

109
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Don't you love me?

110
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,320
Sister.

111
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
Sister, I love you.

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,960
Do you love Li Shu?

113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
I love you.

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,760
Is it what happened

115
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,680
last night?

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
Yep!

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
I bought you some hangover cues.

118
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,280
When I came back, you were gone.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
I thought you got lost.

120
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
After checking, I felt at ease.

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,280
You even went to my house?

122
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
I really drank too much.

123
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,480
But the truth always goes after hangovers.

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,440
And although you took off my clothes

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,120
on the bed last time, you still...

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
Stop it!

127
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
So,

128
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,680
for what you uttered last night,

129
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,800
that doesn't count,

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
right?

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,360
It's not the way you look at it!

132
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,640
Let's put last night's matter aside.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
We really need you now.

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,120
So, do you admit you love me?

135
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I...

136
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Li Shu!

137
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,200
You're here!

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Look at me,

139
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,280
how is it?

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
The makeup looks pretty.

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
And?

142
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
Your clothes suit you well, too.

143
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,040
Looks good!

144
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,520
What about me then?

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,200
You're pretty, too.

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,520
Li Shu, are you forced by someone else

147
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,360
to be here for your internship?

148
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,440
Or do you have to excel at this job to...

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
It's something personal.

150
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,840
Do your best with the filming.

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
I still have something to do.

152
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Keep it up!

153
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
Vivian.

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
I remember when I started mentoring you,

155
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
you knew nothing back then.

156
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Look,

157
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,190
now,

158
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
you've been our backbone, really!

159
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,320
This contract with Jiang is excellent.

160
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,040
Thanks to Mr. Zhang's care these years.

161
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,840
We can invite Miss Jiang here,

162
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,640
that's because our company has done well

163
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
over the past two years.

164
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,600
Keep working!

165
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,520
I have high hopes for you.

166
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Be careful!

167
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,480
Li Shu.

168
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Li Shu!

169
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Are you okay?

170
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,520
Can you still move?

171
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,400
Are you blind?

172
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
Can't you see such a big light?

173
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Mr. Zhang.

174
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Mind your tone!

175
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,880
If it weren't Li Shu,

176
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
you'd got hurt!

177
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
Well...

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,200
Vivian, what do you mean by that?

179
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Literal meaning.

180
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,120
My man got injured.

181
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,140
I need to take him for treatment.

182
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,560
So I won't accompany you.

183
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
He's just an intern.

184
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,960
What's wrong with being an intern?

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,400
Interns are one of us, too.

186
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
Watch your attitude!

187
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
What's wrong with me?

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,600
Mr. Zhang, Vivian is also...

189
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,480
- I'm fine
- I feel anxious!

190
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,200
And I'll continue the tour with you.

191
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Let's go!

192
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Reflect on it thoroughly!

193
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
Mr. Zhang.

194
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,720
It's been a long time to see you!

195
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,880
Why didn't you let me know as he came?

196
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,240
I'd then ask someone to welcome him.

197
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,720
I'm here to visit my sister's set.

198
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,320
- Hope not disturb.
- Doesn't matter.

199
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
I saw someone injured here.

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,560
Should you leave me alone to deal with it?

201
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
As you said,

202
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,440
I was just talking about this!

203
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Vivian!

204
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
Come on and take this thing!

205
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
Well...

206
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,940
- Shu...
- Li Shu.

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,680
Take him to the hospital quickly!

208
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,520
Give him a full body check-up.

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,560
Full body check-up.

210
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Come on, go now!

211
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Let's go!

212
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,920
Li Shu!

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Li Shu!

214
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,520
Miss Jiang did a good job.

215
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,400
A pleasure to meet you.

216
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
Who wants to shake hands with you?

217
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,120
Take off your clothes.

218
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,200
This medicinal spray works well.

219
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,400
Take off your clothes!

220
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

221
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,960
Forget it, and do as I said!

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
So cool!

223
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,720
You've got the nerve to smile now!

224
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
I think you're insane.

225
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
I felt happy.

226
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,480
Sister, you tried to preserve my estate

227
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,040
before the witness.

228
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
However,

229
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
honestly,

230
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
you shouldn't talk back to Mr. Zhang.

231
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,360
He might make things difficult for you.

232
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
So what?

233
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,640
I did it right, and no one can doubt it.

234
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,360
I'm very happy because

235
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,080
you tried harder to help me.

236
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
No matter who they are,

237
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,160
I would have done the same.

238
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,440
After all, I'm a director.

239
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,320
If I can't even protect my men,

240
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,040
who else would be with me?

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Sister, I felt hurt.

242
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
Then I'll be gentle, okay?

243
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,880
Li Shu!

244
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,240
Li Shu!

245
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you okay?

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm fine now.

247
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,480
How could it be possible you're ok?

248
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Let me take a look.

249
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,480
Stop it!

250
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,160
People are watching us.

251
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,960
They're all waiting for you.

252
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,820
Come on, go back to your post.

253
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,400
Or, we'll get off work so late, really.

254
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
You

255
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
go with me for a while.

256
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Miss Jiang.

257
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Li Shu's wound has already been treated.

258
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
It's nothing serious.

259
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,480
Director Tang,

260
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,960
why do I feel

261
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,640
Li Shu treated you differently?

262
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,760
Because I'm his supervisor.

263
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,560
He has no other choice but to follow me.

264
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,320
You're right.

265
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,200
Director Tang, can you

266
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,600
arrange a meal for me with Li Shu?

267
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
I've asked him out several times.

268
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,480
He just ignores me.

269
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,480
I can't meddle in his affairs.

271
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,920
But Li Shu is injured now.

272
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,200
I want to take care of him.

273
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,800
Otherwise, I'll be so worried.

274
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,520
Well, how about this...

275
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll talk to him about this issue.

276
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
But,

277
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
I can't promise you he'll agree with it.

278
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,440
Please, Director Tang, help me!

279
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,440
Okay.

280
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,960
That's great, Director Tang!

281
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,440
I'll go to work now.

282
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,400
I promise to finish it efficiently!

283
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,320
Let's get to work!

284
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,680
Are you feeling better?

285
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,560
It's quite warm.

286
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,960
But it doesn't hurt anymore.

287
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,440
Thank you.

288
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
If you're grateful for my help,

289
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,240
how about having dinner together tonight?

290
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,560
Today...

291
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,480
It might not be possible.

292
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,160
Why not?

293
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,840
Jiang Mi wants you for a meal.

294
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
Jiang Mi?

295
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,040
What about tomorrow night?

296
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
We'll go for it tomorrow.

297
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
Is that ok?

298
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Tomorrow night?

299
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,480
Alright.

300
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm supposed to be angry.

301
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,920
But I also know

302
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,840
work is the most important thing for you.

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,720
But you need to give me your word that

304
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,160
you need to go with me.

305
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
Alright.

306
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,800
(At worst, when the time comes)

307
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,850
(Find a chance to slip away first)

308
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,680
If you want to slip away,

309
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll follow your steps right now.

310
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
(Can this guy read my mind?)

311
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,040
I can read your mind.

312
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,720
I know all your thoughts.

313
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
Your clothes got stained.

314
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,080
Do you want to change them?

315
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,680
I got hurt.

316
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,640
So I can't do that myself.
