19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,280
Don't go!

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,840
You really are that kind of woman!

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
- I...
- Things happened.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,560
Just follow the way it should be!

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
I also know that

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
you're nobody, a model.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,440
Your life is tough, for sure.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Don't worry, I will compensate you!

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
Sister.

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
Stop it.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm leaving for work now.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,320
Why don't you leave first?

31
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,040
Can we talk about it later?

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Just talk about it later!

33
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,000
You have to go, ok?

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,570
Take your things, take them!

35
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,520
How about adding me on WeChat?

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,060
Done!

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,260
You can't afford to block me.

38
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,060
I won't do that! And go now!

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,060
Yes, that's right!

40
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,460
Then let's keep walking!

41
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,660
(One day ago)
Let's keep walking.

42
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,580
We take a rain check,

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,630
- Director Tang.
- to the afternoon?

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
There's a problem now.

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,820
We can't find Li Ben.

46
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,660
Li Ben?

47
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,060
- Yes!
- Tang.

48
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,340
We can't reach Li Ben.

49
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,420
I have no one else

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
for Li Ben's alternative.

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,900
Alright, you keep going.

52
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
I'll think of a way out.

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,920
Okay, then I'll...

54
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,460
(Li Ben: It's up to you today.)

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,100
Be careful!

56
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,420
Do you have a name?

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,380
Me?

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,780
I'm Li Shu.

59
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,820
How many years have you been in it?

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,140
Just a few times.

61
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,380
A few times?

62
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,340
Alright, you'd be on the stage later.

63
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,420
To where?

64
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,380
What are you waiting for?

65
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,300
Hurry up and get changed!

66
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,220
Newcomers must seize opportunities.

67
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,780
I think it's really good!

68
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,380
I heard

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,260
you went to Qingyu's show?

70
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,340
I should say hello first.

71
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,780
Come on!

72
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,100
15, 20, and 15.

73
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,500
15, 20, and 10.

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,100
- You got Li Shu?
- What?

75
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,730
You took Li Shu here, right?

76
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,500
15, 20, and 15.

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,820
- Pear trees?
- 15, 20, and 20.

78
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,860
What's that? I don't grow any of them!

79
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,620
Come on, keep going!

80
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,580
Li Shu, you just came back.

81
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,940
What do you plan to do?

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,500
Brother,

83
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,020
is it me, or

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,300
Tang Weiwei,

85
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
whom you worried about?

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
Stop talking nonsense!

87
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,860
You did bad things.

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,700
You must pay for what you've done!

89
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,580
Am I right?

90
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,900
If it weren't Tang Weiwei,

91
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,380
that promiscuous woman,

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,100
how did your brother get into trouble?

93
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,420
I've tried to convince your brother

94
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,460
a woman like her

95
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,620
tried to get close to him, that was just

96
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,980
for our family fortune.

97
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,380
Are you all right?

98
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,300
Who are you?

99
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,900
What do you want to do?

100
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
You can't walk properly.

101
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,180
I kindly support you.

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,580
I want to thank you.

103
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,100
I can manage.

104
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,940
Attention, the step!

105
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,140
I've arrived!

106
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,500
I've got to go.

107
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,860
Are you sure you can go back yourself?

108
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,740
Yes!

109
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,580
Relax!

110
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,430
I'm leaving.

111
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,460
Let me know when you get home!

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,740
Alright.

113
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,620
Miss, where are you going?

114
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,460
I can take you home.

115
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,620
Who are you?!

116
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
Come on, I can take you home.

117
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
- Let go of me!
- Take you home!

118
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,100
What's wrong with you?

119
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,780
You dare step on me, you stinky woman!

120
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,220
What are you doing?

121
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Just wait and see!

122
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,620
Are you ok?

123
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,100
Who the hell are you?

124
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,540
The designated driver. You called me.

125
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,500
Alright.

126
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,420
Here it is!

127
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,460
We have to go now.

128
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,590
(0921)

129
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,420
(0612)

130
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,940
I want to thank you.

131
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,980
You can leave me alone.

132
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,140
Shall I support you to get you in?

133
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,500
Show me your QR code.

134
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
What?

135
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,180
Are you my designated driver?

136
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
I'll transfer the money to you.

137
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,900
Have we

138
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,980
met before, right?

139
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,220
You have a good-looking

140
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,580
with a nice figure.

141
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,780
Do you want to be in the modeling field?

142
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,700
I'm now working on a show.

143
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,020
We could be friends on WeChat and

144
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,420
have a good chat later.

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,580
Is it the way you get close to a man?

146
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,860
Shiyu, don't leave me alone.

147
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,380
What did you say?

148
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,820
Shiyu, I missed you so much!

149
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,260
Shiyu!

150
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,940
Zip your hole!

151
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,580
What did you say?

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,020
What are you talking about?

153
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,020
Shiyu!

154
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
You are

155
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,460
not fit to speak his name!

156
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,140
