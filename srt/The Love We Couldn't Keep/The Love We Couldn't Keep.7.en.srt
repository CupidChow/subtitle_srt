It's done.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,040
Have dinner with me tomorrow night?

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,160
Tang, are you there?

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
If not, she'd take Li Shu to the hospital.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm ready, and let's go.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
Go now.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,320
Never forget your bag.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,720
May I ask who'll place the order?

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
For this side.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Miss Jiang.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
What do you want to eat?

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Miss Jiang.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
See what dishes would you like?

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
You still have something to do, right?

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,600
So, how about leaving us alone?

35
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,680
Take care, and I won't see you off.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
I recall that

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,560
there's still something for me to do.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,510
Guys, make yourselves at home.

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,450
Then I'll go with the Director.

40
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,240
Negative!

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,960
The schedule for me isn't tight.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
Fine, eat together.

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
Come on.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,720
- Have this.
- No need for that.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
Serve Miss Jiang a bit more.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,480
Miss Jiang, have a bit more.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Li Shu, I just want this!

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Have some.

51
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
And I also want this thing.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Have more.

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm going to the restroom.

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
Enjoy yourself.

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,960
Li Shu, I want some fish.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Alright.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
I also want to have this.

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
What are you doing?

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Let me go off.

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
Never!

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,560
What's wrong with you?

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,640
She'll misunderstand if watching us.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,160
I don't care.

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
But I care!

66
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,720
My chauffeur will be here soon.

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
Li Shu, let me take you back.

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
Well... Li.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,720
- You take her back.
- Yes.

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,960
My car is just in the parking lot.

71
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
I'll go home myself later.

72
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,160
Mr. Tang, take care!

73
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
- Bye-bye.
- Okay, bye-bye.

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Goodbye, Miss Jiang.

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,270
- Li Shu.
- Goodbye!

76
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,360
Stay with me.

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm afraid to be left alone.

78
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Alright.

79
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
Ask your chauffeur to see when he arrives.

80
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
I'll see you in the car later.

81
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,960
But I really have something to do.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
I need to go back to the company.

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,680
Fine!

84
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,710
It's too late!

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,160
You go alone that I can't feel at ease.

86
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,720
Li Shu!

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Relax.

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,400
As long as you go home, I'll leave.

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
Fasten your seatbelt.

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,200
What's wrong?

91
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
Shoulder pain.

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,520
Is it serious?

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Hold on, my hair got tangled.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,960
- Tangled...
- Try again.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Where?

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
It's pulled.

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,520
Here?

98
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,440
No.

99
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Where the hell is it?

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,240
Here?

101
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,200
No.

102
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Ouch...

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
So, do it yourself!

104
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Stop!

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,560
Are you seducing me?

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,360
Sister, are you...

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Seducing me?

108
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,080
What's going on?

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Nothing.

110
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,760
Is all the finishing work done?

111
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,720
All done!

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
All the remaining costumes are also done!

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,400
Okay.

114
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,240
Can I have the output next Monday?

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
They have over a hundred items to go.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,040
So, they won't make it, I think.

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Plus, they still need a confirmation.

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,250
We must strike while the iron is hot.

119
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,520
To schedule the promotion for next week.

120
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
Alright!

121
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,560
Goddamn Tang!

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Over there, I suppose?

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,480
- Miss Jiang.
- Hello.

124
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
Amy.

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,040
Drink a toast!

126
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
(The two guys are side by side.)

127
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,280
(Truly a golden couple!)

128
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,560
Tang Weiwei.

129
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,320
No wonder it took so long to come down!

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Turns out you're meticulously dressed up!

131
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
Meeting your friends is a reason.

132
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,120
Spent a long time on makeup!

133
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,440
- Really?
- Do I look good?

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,680
Look pretty!

135
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,800
See, who's coming?

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,480
It's been a long time to see you.

137
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Long time no see!

138
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,790
By the way,

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,880
I even don't know you have a sister.

140
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
It turns out it's Jiang Mi!

141
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
Yes, I never spoke of her.

142
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
- You.
- You.

143
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
You speak first.

144
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,600
Now.

145
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,280
How have you been?

146
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,680
Not bad.

147
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,960
Director.

148
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
Who's this?

149
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,900
President Jiang?

150
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes, President Jiang of Jiang Media.

151
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,120
The director and Jiang are old acquaintances.

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,400
How did you konw each other?

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,880
We...

154
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,240
You guys keep going.

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,760
I'm going to the restroom.

156
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
Okay.

157
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,800
Alright.

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,040
Shu.

159
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
What exactly do you want to do?

160
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,480
I know what I'm doing.

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
Don't get too close to her.

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,720
Am I getting very close?

163
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,440
Brother.

164
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,240
You've fallen in love with Tang Weiwei?

165
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,080
What nonsense are you up to?

166
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,560
You took much care of her.

167
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
Have you had a crush on her?

168
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
Brother, you're overthinking it.

169
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm leaving now.

170
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
Tang, I got some gossip.

171
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,200
What?

172
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,320
It seems Jiang Wen loves you, too.

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,680
How is that possible?

174
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,560
I heard it with my ears.

175
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
Jiang is Zeng Shiyu's childhood friend.

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
What?!

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
It's quite unbelievable, isn't it?

178
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,760
Such a coincidence!

179
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,880
Well...

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,760
Can I borrow Qu Wan'er for a moment?

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,400
Of course, you can.

182
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
Then I'll take my leave.

183
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,560
Tang.

184
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,080
There's always a bit of misunderstanding

185
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,200
between President Jiang and me.

186
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,090
But fortunately,

187
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,040
this collaboration went very smoothly.

188
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,120
How about I'll have three drinks myself

189
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,040
to express my sincere apologies to him.

190
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,960
Girls would better have a few drinks.

191
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
How can that be?

192
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,560
It's filled with my apologies.

193
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
As I said before,

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,920
no need for that.

195
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
President Jiang, look,

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm feeling a bit embarrassed.

197
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
You're so considerate!

198
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Are you President Jiang?

199
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I've heard a lot about you.

200
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm Lucy. Can we have a drink?

201
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,640
Lucy, he doesn't want any drinks.

202
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,080
Then, let's add each other on WeChat.

203
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,320
I already have Miss Qu's WeChat.

204
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,600
If there's anything to go,

205
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
just ask Miss Qu to reach me.

206
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Then I'm sorry for bothering you.

207
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,000
Jiang, tonight,

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,680
I've offended others because of you!

209
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
We only pick you as the intermediary.

210
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Is it worth it?

211
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,000
That's a deal!

212
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,160
Let Tang Weiwei know that

213
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,000
she can't get too close to Li Shu.

214
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Okay, President Jiang.

215
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
(Stinky man)

216
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
(Likes my sister)

217
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
(Also said not to get too close to Li Shu)

218
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
I'll block you on WeChat when I get back!

219
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,040
Tang Weiwei.

220
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,680
Sister.

221
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
It's only for males.

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Sorry.

223
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
I got it wrong.

224
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Sister, once you met Jiang,

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,920
you got flustered.

226
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,840
Is he also your ex-boyfriend?

227
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,640
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,080
There's nothing between us.

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
Do you have feelings for me?

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,480
Will you still fall for someone else?

231
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,240
Will you do that?

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,440
Li Shu!

233
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm sorry, sister.

234
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,760
It was because

235
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
after seeing President Jiang,

236
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,880
he's young and promising

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
and handsome. I shouldn't have

238
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,840
talked about him like that.

239
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,720
It's nothing.

240
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,880
Brother,

241
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
Weiwei is in a relationship now.

242
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,840
- Your BF is pretty.
- No.

243
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,920
Bye-bye.

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,640
Thank you, and we'll get in.

245
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,320
Stop.

246
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,040
Need to spray a few more times.

247
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,480
What are you doing?

248
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm really sorry.

249
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
I was just

250
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,320
so excited!

251
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,520
So, I finally hurt you.

252
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,040
Doesn't matter.

253
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,000
I was careless about it.

254
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,560
For the past few days,

255
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,640
thank you for accompanying Jiang Mi.

256
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
So,

257
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,920
have you been green-eyed?

258
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Of course not!

259
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
But I'm

260
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,480
very jealous of you and President Jiang.

261
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,680
There's really nothing between

262
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,040
President Jiang and me.

263
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,680
Really?

264
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
