20

Cheers!

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,000
I heard from Mimi that

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,200
you've been part of Qingyu.

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,600
Why didn't you tell me anything?

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,480
If tipping it off, I won't be allowed.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,520
I can recommend you to another one,

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,000
being an independent designer.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,960
No need for that.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
I like the job so much.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,360
In fact, I'm

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,520
a bit worried about you.

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,960
You overthought it.

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,320
I didn't plan to do anything.

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,320
Your brother and I just

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
wish you a happier life.

35
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,910
Relax.

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,900
I will.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
Tang!

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,800
Something went wrong today.

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,440
Wan'er.

40
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,050
Today, when Li Shu stared at me, that

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,360
reminded me of Shiyu.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,970
When the last time he saw me,

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,000
his eyes were also red.

44
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,240
Tang.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,760
Never mind.

46
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,440
Just keep drinking.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,920
Tang.

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Stop weeping.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,200
Wan'er.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,600
I miss Shiyu.

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,440
His death was just an accident.

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
Don't put all the blame

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,640
on yourself.

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
Where are you going?

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,680
To the restroom.

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
I'll go with you.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
No need.

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,520
I can manage.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,880
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,840
Are you Shiyu?

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Yes!

62
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,600
Really?

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,600
Shiyu!

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,240
Take a good look at who I am!

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
It's you!

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
What are you doing?

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Boss...

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,920
I felt so sorry about it!

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
I didn't mean to hit you!

70
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
It's my bad day, really!

71
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,080
It's not the way you look at it.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Stop weeping!

73
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,800
Shiyu!

74
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,560
Shiyu!

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,240
Shiyu.

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
What did you say?

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,360
Shiyu, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm sorry, Shiyu.

82
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,320
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm sorry, Shiyu.

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Take a good look at me!

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,160
You've framed Zeng Shiyu to death!

86
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,980
(Recording)

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
I was wrong.

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
It was my fault!

89
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,000
Sister.

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Sister.

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
What's wrong with you?

92
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Sister.

93
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
You got drunk. Why?

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Shiyu.

95
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Did I upset you?

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
Sister.

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
Do you hate me?

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Sorry.

99
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
I got you wrong. Sorry.

100
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,680
Sister.

101
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,000
I love you.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
Do you love me, too?

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
I love you.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
You are

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,320
a good guy.

106
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,800
But I...

107
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,640
What do you want to tell me?

108
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
What the hell do you want to say?

109
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,360
I...

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
I...

111
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm not as good as you imagined.

112
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,960
Love...

113
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
Love you...

114
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
I...

115
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm not as good as you imagined.

116
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm not as good as you imagined.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,880
Sister.

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,440
Sister.

119
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
What bad luck!

120
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,680
Stinky man!

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
- Doing what?
- Why you hit me?

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,760
You pervert! Looking for trouble!

123
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
You...

124
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
I did nothing.

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Do you think I'm blind?

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,120
Where did you put your hand?

127
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
What are you doing?

128
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
What? Looking for trouble!

129
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
What's going on here?

130
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
Pervert!

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
If having the guts, stay where you are!

132
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Thank you.

133
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,160
It doesn't matter.

134
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Mr. Jiang, this...

135
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Although the bag is broken,

136
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,960
the medicine inside is intact.

137
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,840
Boss, please don't mind!

138
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
Do you have a headache?

139
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,880
How about going to the hospital?

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
No need for that.

141
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm hard to kill.

142
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
Well...

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
I'll handle it for you.

144
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,960
Actually, there's no major wound.

145
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,840
Just a tiny scratch.

146
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,600
It shouldn't be a big problem.

147
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,600
Should be...

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,480
What is this?

149
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Alcohol, for disinfection.

150
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,920
You sprayed it in my eyes!

151
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
Here's some water.

152
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Are you okay?

153
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,440
Not good!

154
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,680
I'd blow on it for you.

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,120
How about

156
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,280
going to the hospital?

157
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
Just forget it.

158
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,400
Leave me alone.

159
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
Really?

160
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
From now on,

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,120
just keep three steps away from me.

162
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,360
I couldn't agree more!

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,280
Then I'm leaving.

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,480
Really speechless!

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,400
How did I end up sleeping here?
