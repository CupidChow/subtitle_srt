Weird! Have snacks!

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,560
I admire

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,960
that Li Shu person!

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,280
I want you here out of

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,080
Jiang Mi is the spokesperson.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,640
I'll take over Jiang Mi's issues later.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,800
But right now, what I'm concerned about

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
is still you.

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,520
I've already told you everything about

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,080
even the simplest things.

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,680
What else do you want to know?

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,800
I think

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
is not all over.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,280
No, it's done!

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,120
I made it clear to him last night.

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,360
But,

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
in line with my intuition,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
that guy won't give up so easily.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,600
He also said

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,040
He and Jiang Mi are just classmates.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,160
Why were you so heartless,

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
intimidating him?

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,120
Gosh!

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,520
You're still at work. Leave here now!

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,680
My intuition is really accurate!

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
Fine!

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,660
(Jiang Mi)

46
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,920
Hello, is this Miss Vivian?

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Hello, Miss Jiang!

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
Tonight, I want to know more about

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,760
your company's brand culture.

50
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,640
Can you ask Li Shu to accompany me?

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
I want to chat while eating.

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,800
No problem!

53
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,880
How about this

54
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,480
I'll go and let him know,

55
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
and for the rest,

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,880
you just talk in private.

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,320
Okay, thank you, Miss Tang.

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay, bye-bye!

59
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,080
You're really somebody!

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Giving him a rejection is ok.

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,000
But to use his rizz for yourself?

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
I did so for work, right?

63
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Besides,

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
having a meal is called using rizz?

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Apparently, Jiang Mi likes Li Shu.

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
You better not wait until

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
they two become a real couple

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,840
and then regret it yourself!

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
We're not supposed to be a couple.

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
It was just an accident.

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,560
Alright, I'll go and let him in.

72
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Director.

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Is there something?

74
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Well...

75
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,640
Jiang Mi wants more about our culture.

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Leave work early and go pick her up.

77
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,280
Have a meal with her and chat a bit.

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't want to go.

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,320
Why?

80
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
It's what you should do.

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,840
So,

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,880
Director, am I asked to

83
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,280
have a meal with her?

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Yes.

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,000
I also know

86
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,080
it might take up your time.

87
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
But,

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
you two are about the same age

89
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
with more common topics.

90
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,440
I really don't want to go.

91
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,200
I just want to

92
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,280
be with you.

93
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,280
I don't want to force things, either,

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,800
asking you to do what you don't like.

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,840
But she's now our new brand ambassador.

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,760
We really need to get close to her.

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,960
What do you think?

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
Well...

99
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,250
Fine!

100
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,700
You agreed with me?

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,960
As long as you still have me under you,

102
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,480
I can continue to like you.

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,520
It's getting late now.

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Go for preparations.

105
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Hurry to pick her up.

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Okay.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
(What's going on?)

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,680
(Why is my heart beating so fast?)

109
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,350
Tang!

110
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,440
I've already arrived.

111
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
I know it.

112
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
Relax.

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,160
(It's also her!)

114
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Sorry!

115
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,600
Sorry!

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Sorry!

117
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm truly sorry!

118
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,360
Look at this!

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,200
It's really...

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Take a step back.

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,520
(Why is this person so strange?)

123
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,620
(Certificate of Honor)

124
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,970
Director Qu, this way, please.

125
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay.

126
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,580
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

127
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,450
A moment. Our boss will be here soon.

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,400
Okay.

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Boss.

130
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
(Why is it her again?)

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Tang!

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,620
You did a good job!

133
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,780
(Jiang Mi, the new spokesperson)

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Thanks for contracting with her in time!

135
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Otherwise,

136
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
the effect wouldn't have been this good!

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,920
Don't even mention it!

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,920
Next time,

139
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,600
I won't go to Jiang Media

140
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,600
for the task of coordinating.

141
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
What happened?

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,120
Did the boss offend you?

143
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
That can't be right!

144
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
Jiang Mi is so beautiful.

145
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
Could it be her brother, who

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
is extremely unattractive?

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
Handsome!

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
So handsome, it's infuriating!

149
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,360
This contract signing is comparable to

150
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,760
the Waterloo of my career!

151
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,760
I'm a master of creating atmospheres.

152
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,080
I almost died of embarrassment.

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm Qingyu's PR director.

154
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,760
Just call me Wanda.

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,060
I'm sorry to hurt you accidentally.

156
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,000
After a bad start, we knew each other.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
We got acquainted in advance.

158
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,840
I believe we'll have a very happy chat.

159
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
He doesn't respond to me.

160
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,200
He doesn't respond to me!

161
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
Do you know how upset I am?

162
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,000
Even if he argues with me,

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,640
it's better than the deathly silence!

164
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,240
The contract has already been

165
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
electronically sent to you in advance.

166
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,360
It's the paper version.

167
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
See if anything that needs to be revised.

168
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,320
Something that needs to be changed...

169
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
You take two steps back.

170
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,480
Take two steps back!

171
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,660
(Celebrity Endorsement Cooperation Agreement)

172
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
I've gone through it.

173
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
There are still a few small issues.

174
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,840
Miss Qu, if you are tired,

175
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,200
then let's continue tomorrow.

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,120
Tomorrow?

177
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,880
No.

178
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm not tired at all.

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
What other issues are there within?

180
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,060
(Three full days of shooting is a must)

181
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Do you think

182
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,880
I might have somehow

183
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,960
offended him without knowing?

184
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,120
He has a bad temper and is demanding.

185
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
You know, later on,

186
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,560
in that contract,

187
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,840
how many places were marked?

188
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
It was my first business negotiation.

189
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,880
We talked until almost ten o'clock.

190
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,400
And they didn't even provide a meal.

191
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
You said those two siblings are

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,560
here to specifically mess with us, right?

193
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,520
You're wrong.

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
They're here to boost our careers.

195
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,100
(Diversity Emerging)
After the letter

196
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,680
(Focus on promotion)
and the speakperson

197
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
the mall's visit volume increased by

198
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,760
300 percent.

199
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,920
Our proof is detailed enough.

200
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,440
(Opinion trending)
It's one-sided.

201
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,720
Moreover, discussions have been heated.

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,200
Made it to the top ten trending searches.

203
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
(Trending Searches)
We used it

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,680
to enhance national awareness.

205
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
Good, very good!

206
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,760
As for Wanda, this time

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,080
completed the task I assigned.

208
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Very well!

209
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,360
Women are not inferior to men!

210
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,600
You got some of the styles I had!

211
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
Truly, it moves me deeply!

212
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,320
It's no longer just me charging alone!

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,440
We are, indeed, one big family!

214
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
This time, it was our united effort,

215
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
a manifestation of our cohesion.

216
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
I hope

217
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
to make our company's performance

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
brilliant once again!

219
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,280
As for this, Vivian,

220
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,720
why didn't she come to this meeting?

221
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,240
Mr. Zhang.

222
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,320
We heard Jiang Mi to be the spokesperson.

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
They added some new styles.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,880
Vivian, this morning,

225
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,720
hurried to contact the suppliers.

226
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
As for this, Vivian,

227
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,760
she's still too young!

228
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,640
Lacks experience!

229
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,600
Such a small occasion

230
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,440
should have been scheduled long ago!

231
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
Still not experienced enough!

232
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,160
You're right!

233
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
If there's nothing else, let's

234
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
adjourn the meeting.

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
It's nothing. Just let her pass again.

236
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,480
Okay.

237
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,040
Linda.

238
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
Director.

239
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Director.

240
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,760
You have noticeably declined!

241
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
You're also not in the right state.

242
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,280
Pay attention!

243
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,520
We don't keep people who slack off!

244
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm sorry, Director.

245
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,760
I definitely won't do this again.

246
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,220
(Qingyu Design)

247
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,720
Director, it's time to get off work.

248
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,720
Linda, still working overtime?

249
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm leaving soon.

250
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,480
Alright, go home early.

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,920
Li.

252
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,960
The follow-up with Jiang Mi

253
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,480
will need you to handle it personally.

254
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Of course, about other work,

255
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,240
there will also be others helping with it.

256
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,760
But,

257
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,440
you need to contact her personally.

258
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
You don't have a problem, do you?

259
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,360
If I have a problem,

260
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,680
Director, would you retract the order?

261
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,720
I'll fall for others; that doesn't matter.

262
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,080
What happened that night,

263
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,080
only I kept it in my heart.

264
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,880
Do you have no feelings for me at all?

265
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,160
Li Shu!

266
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
Alright.

267
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
I understand.

268
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
Director,

269
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,760
you don't casually provoke others.

270
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,270
What should I do?

271
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,040
Will the director fire me?

272
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,200
In line with his strictness towards work,

273
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,440
it's possible.

274
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
Amy.

275
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,020
Both of my parents are in poor health.

276
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,440
The household expenses all depend on me.

277
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,280
I really can't afford to lose this job.

278
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,840
Have you been taking freelance work outside?

279
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
No, I haven't.

280
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,720
We strictly prohibit taking freelance work!

281
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,520
Director, the latest financial budget.

282
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,520
Li Shu!

283
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,080
You...

284
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,280
Did something happen?

285
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,720
I mean, you look different today.

286
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,400
Didn't the Director want me

287
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,560
to keep my distance from you?

288
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm fine, you can rest assured.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,240
But Linda

290
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,320
seems to be not doing well.

291
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,640
You may leave.

292
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,400
Director!

293
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,280
Linda!

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
You took freelance work?

295
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,720
Director, I know I was wrong.

296
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
My mother is ill.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,380
The surgery costs are particularly high.

298
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
I really have no way out.

299
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,760
We explicitly prohibit taking private jobs.

300
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,400
You know about this, right?

301
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
Director!

302
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,000
I beg you, for the sake of

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,360
my many years at Qingyu,

304
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,280
please don't fire me!

305
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,040
How much?

306
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,040
What?

307
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
The surgery costs.

308
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
How much is still needed?

309
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,560
Director!

310
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
A department is a collective.

311
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,720
When someone within has an issue,

312
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,840
everyone should bear it together.

313
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,800
You can't shoulder it alone.

314
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Do you understand?

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,920
You said you

316
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,130
encountered such a big issue.

317
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,320
I don't even know how to tell us.

318
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm embarrassed.

319
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,880
I really didn't expect

320
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,640
the director would help me with it.

321
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,480
She's tough outside but soft inside.

322
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560
Yes!

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
From now on,

324
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,140
if the director tells me to go east,

325
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,040
I won't go west!

326
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,680
I'll follow her for a lifetime.
