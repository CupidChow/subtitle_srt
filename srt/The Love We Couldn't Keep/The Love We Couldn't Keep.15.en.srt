Why are you here?

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,240
Where have you been all this time?

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,600
Do you know I've long looked for you,

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,960
but failed, and that upset me?

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,240
Li Shu, where have you been?

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,560
Let's go home.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,500
Hey man standing opposite me!

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
What are you doing?

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
You touched my sister. Let her go!

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,440
- Let go!
- That's Li Shu!

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,640
Li Shu, it's you!

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Li Shu!

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
You still know how to come back, huh?

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,400
You're really something!

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,400
Tang is getting wronged!

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,280
But look at you!

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,220
You're playing hide and seek!

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,920
Wan'er, stop talking!

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,000
Stop talking!

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
No, I have to say!

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,320
For Xu Jing and Zhang Ruichao,

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,440
they bullied Weiwei so much like this!

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
Aren't you her boyfriend?

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Where are you?

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,840
Who are you?

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,800
Take a look at who I am!

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,080
Do you know that

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
you look

46
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,320
especially like someone else?

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,560
Like who?

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Like...

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,400
Someone's kept in my heart!

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,160
I'll take her back first.

51
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,320
- Okay.
- Come.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
Li Shu!

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
Don't go!

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,720
Okay.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
I won't go!

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
Do you know that

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,800
he died beacuse of me?

58
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
What did you say?

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,600
He got me wrong that I had an affair.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,360
We quarreled all day long.

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,480
Then he got drunk himself.

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,920
Drove out and got into an accident.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
It's all my fault.

64
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,640
It was my fault that he died!

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,440
Misunderstanding?

66
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,720
Having an affair with someone else?

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
Was it really a misunderstanding?

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,560
I don't know who took those photos.

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,800
I absolutely did nothing to betray him!

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,160
If I knew he drove out, then an accident

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,400
occurred to him on that day,

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,160
I wouldn't have let him go!

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,200
I really wouldn't have let him go!

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,080
It's all my fault!

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Shiyu.

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,120
Where did you go?

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,630
Why can't I find you?

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
What's wrong?

79
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,680
As for these photos,

80
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
are they real?

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Where did you get these things?

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,080
Doesn't matter about where to get them.

83
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,000
Just be honest with me that

84
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
are those real?

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,360
Of course not!

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
I know the person in the photo.

87
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,000
He's your senior, right?

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
He's been pursuing you for a long time.

89
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
I know that.

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,080
You just need to let me know,

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
whether you've

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,800
betrayed me.

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,280
Of course, I didn't!

94
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,000
Zeng Shiyu.

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,360
We've been a couple for four years.

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,480
You'd rather believe what others show you.

97
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
You don't want to believe me, do you?

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Weiwei.

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
I really...

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,480
I really love you!

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,320
As long as you're willing to admit it,

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
I can forgive you.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Admit what?

104
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
You're truly absurd!

105
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,200
You don't believe me, do you?

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
Fine!

107
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Let's break up!

108
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Break up?

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,520
It's your fault.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,760
But you want to break up with me?

111
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,280
My fault?

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,680
You're really unreasonable!

113
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,240
Stop drinking!

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
I haven't got drunk yet!

115
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
I can continue.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,200
Do you think who I am?

117
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,200
The Universe's Number One PR!

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,490
Who the hell can drink more than me?

119
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,520
You should have a range of releases.

120
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
Don't overexert yourself!

121
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Why are you so annoying?

122
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
So nagging!

123
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
I heard from Mimi that

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,520
there were rumors about us.

125
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,080
Is that why you ignored me?

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
Do you know which company's CEO has been

127
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240
fallen into Qu Wan'er's affection?

128
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
It's President Jiang of Jiang Group.

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,840
What, President Jiang?

130
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Yeah, I didn't even know!

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,360
Qu Wan'er is so plain-looking.

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
How did she win the favor of Jiang?

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
And many rumors run wild outside

134
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
that she got them all this way!

135
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,800
She really has some means.

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,480
She's quite sophisticated to use them.

137
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,800
How do you know?

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
Are you planting a spy

139
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,800
in my company?

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
To be honest, yes or no?

141
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes!

142
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
So what?

143
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
I don't want to give them a chance

144
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
to stab me in my back, spreading rumors.

145
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
What do others say that really matters?

146
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,280
Yes, it matters!

147
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
For someone as insignificant as me,

148
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
every step I take

149
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,960
should be cautious!

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
I fear I'd make a wrong step to ruin it.

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,200
But you're different.

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,140
I'd never believe the likes of you

153
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,680
could be sincere!

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
Do you want to try it?

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
No!
