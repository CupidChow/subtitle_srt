21

I'm your neighbor.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,380
I never noticed the rental information.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,400
How did you find this place?

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
Auntie!

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,200
Li,

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,060
look,

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,520
I've rented the apartment for you.

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
As the saying goes,

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,200
first come, first served.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,270
Just keep it up!

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
Alright.

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,240
My mother trusts you so much, really?

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Yes!

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,120
I promised Auntie that

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
I must win you over!

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
Come on.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,200
This thing...

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Look!

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,600
This color goes well with it,

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
right?

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Make this painting a bit brighter.

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Do you mean here?

43
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Weiwei!

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
Weiwei!

45
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,240
Time for breakfast!

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,200
Li Shu!

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,160
What's up?

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm a bit nervous.

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Come on.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,160
How odd you feel nervous?

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Why is that?

52
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,420
Just relax!

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
You're so amazing,

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,720
aren't you?

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
I found a way out.

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,160
Are you kidding me?

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,560
Still nervous?

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
A little better.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,560
After careful consideration,

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,320
we'd invite Qingyu

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
to be our

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
partner.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
Thank you, General Manager Fen.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
Congratulations! You secured the order!

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,800
Tonight,

66
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,040
shall we hang out for fun?

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,520
Tonight?

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,240
I won't go anywhere!

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
I have things to do.

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,320
I think your absence

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
is inappropriate, isn't it?

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,520
I plan to

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
let Li Shu know what happened.

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,480
Are you serious?

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,280
Exciting!

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
Then,

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
I'll follow up.

78
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,920
Be serious!

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,700
(Li Shu, ok for tonight's dinner?)

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,080
Weiwei.

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,040
Weiwei, what's wrong with you today?

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,480
I lost my lover on

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
that rainy day three years ago.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Your lover?

85
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,360
Yes!

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
He died because of me.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,080
Specifically, a set of photos.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
We querreled.

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,000
What photos?

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,320
Weiwei, I want to know all the details

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,840
from you.

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,780
Is that ok?

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,440
You can't drink anymore!

94
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
You've already had a lot!

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,640
Stop drinking!

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
I mean it!

97
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
Stop!

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,440
Come, look at me!

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,720
You make me hurt!

100
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Sorry, Weiwei.

101
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,480
I didn't mean to be rude to you!

102
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
I want to know everything about you!

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,240
You can utter them to me.

104
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,360
If tipping it off,

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,640
you'll feel better, won't you?

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,240
No matter what happens in the future,

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,080
we'll face it together.

108
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
I caused his death.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,200
If it weren't me,

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,200
he wouldn't have died!

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,280
(You're finally going to admit it!)

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,920
Weiwei!

113
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,840
Anything else you want to let me know?

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
No, and that's all.

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,440
Really?

116
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Yes, and I mean it.

117
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,640
I feel happy that you can utter them.

118
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,320
Then can I

119
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,000
add some more weight to your heart?

120
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
What's that?

121
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,240
To be with me,

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
is that ok?

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
Whatever we'll face in the future,

124
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,360
we'll confront it together.

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
Let's be together!

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Okay!

127
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,480
Okay!

128
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
Sorry.

129
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
Qu Wan'er!

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
Mr. Jiang!

131
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,360
What a coincidence!

132
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,240
Enjoy yourself!

133
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,200
See you later!

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,960
What's wrong with you?

135
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
You didn't text me back. Why?

136
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,820
You didn't even answer the phone.

137
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,920
My phone broke.

138
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
Are you a liar?

139
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
Lies come out of your mouth so easily!

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Yes, and so what?

141
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
You can't stand it, huh?

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,240
If so,

143
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,320
just stay away from me!

144
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,160
Why do you look down, ignoring the road?

145
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,120
What if you fall and I'm not around?

146
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,400
- Even if so.
- So annoying!

147
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
You can't keep falling all the time!

148
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,800
It's you seducing me first.

149
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Can I really not stay?

150
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,400
Yes, you can't.

151
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800
Well...

152
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
can I have a goodnight kiss?

153
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,520
Goodnight.

154
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
Goodnight.

155
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,780
(Destruction)

156
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,920
Okay.

157
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
Tang Weiwei,

158
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,120
have you really fallen for me?

159
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,160
How could a woman like you

160
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,440
fall for someone else?

161
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
A woman like you.

162
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,800
How could you fall for someone else?

163
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,060
