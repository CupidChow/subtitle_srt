Zhang Ruichao!

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
Let her go!

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,880
She ruined everything!

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Today, I will perish with her!

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,120
I reported you!

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,120
It has nothing to do with her!

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,240
Shut up!

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
Put it down. Have a quick word?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,200
Li Shu, don't come over!

29
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,050
Don't come over!

30
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,760
Put it down and talk it out?

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
Nonsense!

32
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,000
You guys forced things!

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,200
Then, you guys have to go to die!

- Sister Vivian!

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,320
Vivi...

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
Quick, call an ambulance!

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Let me go!

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
- Let go of me!
- Well behaved!

39
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,960
Don't move!

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,280
- Drug this one out!
- Let go of me!

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,160
Call the police now!

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,360
Are you okay?

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm fine!

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,440
- Tang Weiwei!
- Go!

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
Wait and see!

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,160
Don't move! Well behaved!

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Li Shu!

48
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,440
What's wrong with your hands?

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,880
It's nothing!

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Well...

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
What's wrong?

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
I... Let's say...

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,520
What if one day we encounter a criminal?

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,480
It's a society ruled by law.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,160
Where would there be any criminals?

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
I said just in case!

57
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,080
In case we encounter a thug,

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
I will

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
give you a wink.

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,440
Then,

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,680
give him an elbow strike!

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Then kick him with a flying kick!

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
When he gets disturbed,

64
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
I'll flee away!

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
How about that?

66
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay!

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
Mom!

68
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,600
Mom!

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Auntie!

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,600
About his wound,

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,520
better to have some treatments.

72
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
You guys keep going.

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,320
Do you know he'll come today?

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,640
So you've been worried all along.

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,320
Anyway, he got caught this time.

76
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
It's tough for him to be released.

77
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
You can relax now.

78
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Why have I been upset?

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
It's not me who's hurt.

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,760
It hurts a lot!

81
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm telling you that

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
if my hand becomes useless,

83
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
I'll put my life in your hands.

84
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,360
If it's useless, just forget it.

85
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
What?

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,320
If it's useless, just forget it?

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
Sister Weiwei!

88
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
Things go wrong!

89
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,920
Due to Qingyu's fabric renovation,

90
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,040
Moni lost market share,

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,960
so quite a few manufacturers result.

92
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
The one we previously cooperated with,

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,520
whose capacity was taken over by Qingyu.

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,920
Xu Jing, that wretched person!

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,320
Less capable, but always causing trouble!

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Wanwan, watch the public opinion and data!

97
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
Take down the stock once it runs low!

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,980
Let me know if things go wrong!

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
- Okay!
- Amy.

100
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,160
Keep reaching Moni's manufacturer.

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Linda.

102
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,400
Start communicating with the client.

103
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,760
If anyone wants to replace the fabric,

104
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,160
we'll give up ten percent of the profit!

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,040
- Okay.
- Chengcheng.

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,200
Go with me for another fabric.

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
I will contact the supplier.

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
You guys, do it now!

109
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Let's go!

111
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,040
(Ms. Cai)
Li Shu, let's talk.

112
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
Li!

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,520
I can't say yes to the relationship

114
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,920
between you and Weiwei.

115
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
Auntie.

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
I understand it.

117
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,760
I got half of my life's savings

118
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,280
in this card.

119
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
I want to have the shares you own.

120
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,360
If it's not enough,

121
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,440
I'll pay you back later.

122
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
Auntie!

123
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,720
What is this for?

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
I know

125
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,240
you're sincere to Weiwei.

126
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,680
But have you thought about it

127
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,200
as long as you stay by her side,

128
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
she won't let Shiyu's issue

129
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
go of.

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
It's the same for you.

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
I know you are a good kid.

132
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,320
I really hope you can understand that

133
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,680
I'm her mother, a selfish woman.

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Auntie.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,320
Grateful for you to tell me about this.

136
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Just wait.

137
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,040
Till I can help her with this issue,

138
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
I can give you my word that

139
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,080
I will never appear in front of her!

140
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,640
I really can't have your card.

141
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
Please take it back!

142
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,080
I hope

143
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,440
you can keep your word!

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Okay.

145
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I still have something to do.

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm leaving.

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,560
This arm circumference is okay.

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
15.1 centimeters.

149
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,760
Which one looks good?

150
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
I think this version is the best!

151
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
This one, huh?

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
I think this set is pretty good!

153
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
Well...

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,320
Why you come back so late recently?

155
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,320
Have you been snowed under?

156
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
No.

157
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Not busy.

158
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,760
Mom,

159
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,400
you're feeling much better these days.

160
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
Make sure to get plenty of rest!

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm fine.

162
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,320
You come, then I'll go to bed.

163
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Mom.

164
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
Once things are settled at the company,

165
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll take you to live abroad.

166
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
How about that?

167
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
I've thought about it.

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,240
A professional manager is needed.

169
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
That should be quite reliable.

170
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
Okay.

171
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,860
Now, two factories are on the list.

172
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,830
There is a small amount of Moni.

173
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,920
It might be due to low production,

174
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
so we could have them this time.

175
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,760
Relax. Get as many as they are.

176
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,720
Some customers canceled their orders.

177
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
But,

178
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,880
there're still 60% of customers who

179
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
agree to change the fabric.

180
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
We have some new customers.

181
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
And we've reached them.

182
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
Excellent!

183
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,800
Online sales are stable.

184
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,120
Promptly removed some items.

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,120
I also posted a new goods preview.

186
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,160
The pre-sale volume exceeded 10,000!

187
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,560
The discussion's popularity is ongoing!

188
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
Thank you for your effort!

189
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
And also,

190
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,520
Mr. Li arranged new fabrics for us.

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,720
I asked the factory to prepare new samples,

192
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,520
so we can keep up with the new orders.

193
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,360
Okay.

194
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,320
Let's all work hard together!

195
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,470
- Keep it up!
- Keep it up!

196
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Thank you for finding the supplier!

197
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,400
Is your injury feeling better?

198
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Remember, stay away from water!

199
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,420
(Go to bed early)

200
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,820
(Weiwei)

201
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Go to bed early.

202
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,440
There's good news tomorrow.

203
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,230
Come and see who’s here.

204
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,880
Why are you here?

205
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,080
Of course, it's...

206
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,960
Li Shu asked me to come to you.

207
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,040
She volunteered to come and help.

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,080
I...

209
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,120
I remember your contract with

210
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,400
Qingyu hasn't expired yet, right?

211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,840
My brother has already helped me with it.

212
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,000
And,

213
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,200
this outfit of yours

214
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,560
is designed so ordinarily.

215
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm only here because of my brother.

216
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
Li Shu.

217
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,720
And also,

218
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,440
for the sake of my future sister-in-law.

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,920
That's why I agreed to come over.

220
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,720
Chengcheng.

221
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Chengcheng.

222
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,680
Get that new outfit to get her changed.

223
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Chengcheng.

224
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,400
Chengcheng.

225
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,760
Get changed.

226
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay.

227
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Go now.

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,760
Is there something on my face?

229
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,400
Go now!

230
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,560
Get the clothes!

231
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,480
Come on!

232
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Let me have a look!

233
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
This one looks pretty good!

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,920
Did you take it?

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,040
Looks really nice!

236
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,720
Guys,

237
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,720
today's live broadcast ends.

238
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
Bye-bye!

239
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm exhausted!

240
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
Teacher Jiang,

241
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,480
let's take a break over there!

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,840
Where are we going?

243
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,760
To rest area.

244
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Let's go!

245
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,600
Teacher Jiang, sit and rest.

246
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,480
So tired!

247
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,790
Give it to me.

248
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,640
I can handle it.

249
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,120
Teacher Jiang.

250
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
You've worked hard, have some water!

251
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,360
Thank you.

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Choked!

253
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,800
Here it is!

254
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you.

255
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
This time,

256
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,920
with the help of Jiang Mi's popularity,

257
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,520

258
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,760
and offline orders

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
have already exploded!

260
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
And,

261
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,880
the fabric issue of the new product

262
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,480
has finally been resolved!

263
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,400
She volunteered to come.

264
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,960
I still want to thank you.

265
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
Can I ask for a reward, then?

266
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,800
What reward?

267
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400

268
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,960

How about that?

271
