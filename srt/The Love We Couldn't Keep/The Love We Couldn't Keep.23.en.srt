If so, will your mom go mad?

22

Actually,

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,520
since Li Shu got injured,

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,000
my mom hasn't mentioned

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,440
the break-up matters anymore!

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
What about you?

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,000
I used to think he was naive,

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,200
crazy,

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,720
and unreasonable.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
But the recent issues

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
make me feel

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,240
it feels like only he can make me

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,560
feel at ease.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,400
As long as we're a couple,

35

nothing is impossible.

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,760
But you've been apart for so long.

37

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
And also

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,400
about Li Shu's mother.

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,520
What do you plan to do about it?

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't know.

42

Let's take it one step at a time.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,120
I can't stand it anymore.

44

You're welcome.

51

Why did you have a ponytail today?

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Doesn't it look good?

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,920
Pretty!

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Come on, I'll take you to a place!

57

Hello, are you Vivian?

- Yes!
- Gosh, your fan!

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,320
I favor what you designed!

66
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
I am filming a video.

How do tiny firms like yours

117
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,560
have the nerve to compete

118
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,280
for cooperation with Geng Di?

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
Perhaps you forgot that

120
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
the contract with Geng Di last year

121
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,240
was signed by the two of us.

122
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,560
At that time,

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
perhaps, Xu, you should be a nobody.

124
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,040
Indeed,

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,920
the designs from this past year

126
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,080
are really bad-looking.

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,840
If you could spare time,

128
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
why not focus your energy on design?

129
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880

192
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,520
You have a whole set of tricks.

193
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Where did you learn them?

194
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
This collaboration with Geng Di

195
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
was actually as what we expected.

196
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,320
We already had a very solid foundation.

197
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,960
I heard about this bidding.

198
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
Another brand is called Starry Sky.

199
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,520
You two once had unpleasant things.

200
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
In this bidding,

201
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,920
did they give Qing Yu

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,160
any kind of pressure?

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
Pressure?

204
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,720
Our Qing Yu is a leading national

205
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,280
fashion design brand.

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,520
If talking about pressure,

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
it should be we force them!

208
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
Geng Di secured domestic funding.

209
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,520
Guess which company we got from?

210
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,880
Which one?

211
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,160
Zeng's!

212
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,520
Isn't that Li's company?

213
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
Shouldn't Geng Di

214
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,320
choose us instead?

215
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,700
Forget it!

216
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
What do you mean by forget it?

217
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,720
When Li Shu comes back, I'd make it clear.

218
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,320
I said forget it!

219
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,720
I'm going out for some fresh air!

220
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,550
Mom!

221
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm back, Mom!

222
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
Mom!

223
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
Mom!

224
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,640
Around Starry Sky Studio.

225
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,780
(Gold digger, unfaithful woman)

226
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,580
(Unfaithful woman)

227
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
Why?

228
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,600
Are you okay?

229
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
It's okay!

230
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Hello everyone.

231
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,920
Hi!

232
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,360
Who are you?

233
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,800
I want to know about what happened to

234
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,480
Tang Weiwei and Li Shu at Qing Yu?

235
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,760
Weiwei!

236
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
How is it?

237
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,440
Do you feel any better?

238
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,880
Weiwei!

239
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,840
I'm really sorry.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,920
You also know that

241
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
since my brother passed away, my

242
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Mom's mental state has not been good.

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,520
She had improved a bit during this time.

244
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,360
But now...

245
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
I had always planned

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,320
to take her abroad when I had the time.

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,680
Take a good rest for a while.

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
It might help with her condition.

249
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Take your mom abroad with you?

250
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,760
Yes!

251
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,650
When?

252
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,420
Wait till things in Starry Sky Studio

253
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,600
are stable.

254
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,960
Then, we'll go for the plan.

255
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,520
But I wonder why things go wrong.

256
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,920
She suddenly knew about your things.

257
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Weiwei.

258
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
I have to find her now.

259
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
Too dangerous for her to be alone.

260
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,320
Will you wait till I come back?

261
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,600
Wait a moment.

262
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,720
I'll go with you.

263
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,520
Along with Jiang Wen

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
and Wanwan.

265
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,320
More people will make it easier.

266
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
Okay!

267
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,800
Go over there and take a look.

268
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,480
Let's go over there!

269
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
Shiyu.

270
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,800
I'll definitely avenge you!

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,680
Aunt!

272
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,680
You asked me here for something else?

273
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
I'll say no to the relationship between

274
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,080
you and Shiyu!

275
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
Why?

276
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,120
It's been for more than three years!

277
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
We get along well with each other!

278
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
I do not agree!

279
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,640
Do you think Shiyu will

280
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,720
listens to me, his mother,

281
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,200
or listen to you?

282
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,720
But we

283
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,720
truly love each other!

284
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,920
I know quite well about

285
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,360
your little schemes!

286
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,200
Shiyu is a kind guy.

287
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,320
I can see him through.

288
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Aunt!

289
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,880
I finally got you.

290
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,560
Auntie, let go!

291
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,880
Calm down!

292
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,520
Li Shu is coming over soon.

293
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,000
Li Shu?

294
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,960
He can't be here!

295
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,640
He can't see you!

296
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,480
You will get him killed!

297
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,280
- Auntie!
- Definitely kill him!

298
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,120
Mom!

299
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,920
Shiyu, now, Mom avenges you!

300
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,780
