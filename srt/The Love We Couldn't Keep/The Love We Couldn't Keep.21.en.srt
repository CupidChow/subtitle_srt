=Episode 21=

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,800
It's already two o'clock.

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,030
Are you all tired?

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,360
Why not go to bed early?

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
I'll sort out the company's structure,

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,560
then sending it to you.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,680
So,

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,360
thank you, Mr. Li.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,920
I also have connections with factories

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,960
and fabric suppliers.

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,200
I can recommend them to you all.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
Ye Chengcheng can manage all of these.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,200
About designing,

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,630
I can also be part of it.

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,640
I have to go for a livestream.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,640
I think you haven't snowed under?

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,400
Yes.

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,680
Mr. Li.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Take care.

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Alright.

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,400
Then, good night.

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
Go to bed early.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,040
Why did you speak of Ye Chengcheng?

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,600
I did it on purpose.

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
What's wrong?

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,960
You made me speechless, really!

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,360
I hate to talk to you.

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,480
Fine, and he's left.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,800
You...

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Also,

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
good night.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Good night.

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
See you tomorrow.

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,200
This outfit really suits your style!

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,360
How about trying it on together?

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
You have such a good eye.

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Look at these things.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,280
They're all bestsellers in our store.

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
How about taking them all?

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Alright!

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,770
- A piece of cake!
- This way, please.

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Are you insane?

60
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
Hello, welcome!

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,480
These are all our new styles.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,320
You can take a look and try them on.

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,000
How handsome you are!

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
I'll take all of these!

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Can I take a picture with you?

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
Take them all, really?

67
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
Fine.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
Come on!

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,040
Pervert!

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,600
First, an introduction.

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,600
Look, these are all new arrivals.

72
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,520
Tang Weiwei.

73
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,040
You won't be resurfaced, I promise!

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,840
Tang, you really have lots of rizz!

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
Indeed, good-looking is everything.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
Hurry to the warehouse to restock!

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
There will be nothing left later.

78
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
You said it!

79
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,400
I need to take inventory quickly, then

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,320
arranging for a reorder!

81
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Go ahead!

82
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,200
Wolfdog CEO.

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
Puppy university student.

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Do you think which one is better?

85
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
Haven't you exhausted?

86
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
You still spare energy to gossip!

87
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,520
I think you still have some feelings

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,040
to Li Shu.

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,520
What the hell do you think?

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
What do I think?

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Right now,

92
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,720
I just want to go home and sleep.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm leaving.

94
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,000
The likes of women...

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Next piece of clothing.

96
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
Hello.

97
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,200
- The next one?
- Look at this one.

98
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,720
We make it a dress.

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,840
Then, we put a lace upon it.

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,680
The gold thread design is also the latest.

101
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
If you like it, you can try it on.

102
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Guys, you'll notice that

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
this sort of shirt...

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
We can't buy their clothes!

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,080
Wearing it causes a rash!

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,240
There is a problem with their clothes!

107
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
What's wrong?

108
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,220
(Tip: 9 people are watching. End it now?)

109
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
This clothing is our bestseller now.

110
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,080
Many people favor it so much.

111
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,840
Do you think it's her?

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,000
It seems you're right.

113
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
There is a problem with their clothes.

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
Then, let's go.

115
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,480
Our clothes need to be fixed.

116
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
Sister Weiwei.

117
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,560
My uncle and aunt saw the livestream.

118
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,360
Now, they want to terminate the contract.

119
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,520
I'll try to get them convinced.

120
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,840
Just wait.

121
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,880
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,400
How could you cancle it as you pleased?

123
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,640
The order has been placed.

124
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,000
Rumors run wild.

125
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
All fake news.

126
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,830
Hello!

127
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,630
Hello!

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
Xu Jing should be held accountable!

129
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, it must be her!

130
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,560
She just can't stand others doing well.

131
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,560
- I'd get her!
- You better not go.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
We don't have any evidence.

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,080
Even if we go, she won't admit it.

134
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,920
Do we just have to suffer in silence?

135
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,520
I think

136
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,480
we'd stop live streaming for a few days.

137
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,040
We'll make some improvements.

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
It's getting late.

139
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
Just go back and have some rest.

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
- No! We...
- It's ok.

141
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,800
Let's go.

142
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
What comes next Is a dress that

143
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,600
our brand is heavily promoted.

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,900
Lace and this kind of fabric splicing

145
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,680
make of the overall design.

146
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,480
(Quality Issues )
You take a look.

147
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
(It's inferior.)
Very exquisite.

148
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,040
We...

149
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,220
(Cause allergies. It doesn't look right)

150
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
Weiwei.

151
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
Have you eaten?

152
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
Let's eat something together.

153
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm not hungry.

154
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
Alright.

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
I'll keep you company.

156
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,480
You two guys.

157
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,760
I won't rent the house anymore.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Move out by tomorrow!

159
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,280
I'll handle it.

160
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,240
Our contract is for three years.

161
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
We've only moved in for a month.

162
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
If you want to terminate it,

163
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,280
pay double the remaining rent!

164
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
And,

165
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
if you have the money ready,

166
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,680
we can move out immediately!

167
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Why are you so self-righteous?!

168
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,920
What kind of people are we?!

169
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,920
I can understand your sense of justice.

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,110
But to be honest,

171
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,880
what happened is just a rumor.

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
Relax.

173
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,920
Give me a week.

174
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,320
We will clarify everything.

175
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
So, you...

176
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,520
Alright, I'll give you a week.

177
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,960
If you can't clear your names,

178
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
you move out!

179
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,360
I won't refund a penny!

180
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,720
As soon as you came here,

182
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
I drug you into such big trouble.

183
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,120
As long as you're okay.

184
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,320
Are you sorting out the evidence?

185
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Regarding the previous plagiarism issue,

186
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,680
although the other party denied it,

187
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,720
luckily, there is evidence.

188
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,520
Someone will trust us!

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
As for us,

190
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
from the very beginning,

191
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
I got close to you on purpose.

192
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,400
I bugged you.

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,080
It was not your fault.

194
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,680
Li Shu.

195
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,360
Tang, I thought about it.

196
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,480
You guys keep going.

198
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm leaving.

199
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
Hello everyone, I'm Tang Weiwei.

200
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,600
Today, I'm here to clarify some things

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
that were spread online before.

202
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,600
You can see the whiteboard behind me.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,920
We don't cause trouble.

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,400
But we fear nothing.

205
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
I hope someone can put their time

206
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,500
and energy into truly meaningful things.

207
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,960
Let's work hard together to contribute

208
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,200
to promote our national brands.

209
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,460
Finally,

210
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,680
our commercial time for you guys.

211
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,600
Brand Starry Sky is about to come out.

212
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,080
Stay tuned!

213
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,360
When it ends,

214
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
let's have a gathering at my place.

215
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,160
- Okay.
- Sure!

216
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
Hello everyone, I'm Tang Weiwei.

217
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm here to clarify some rumors online.

218
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,000
(So seriously)
See the whiteboard.

219
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,480
We don't cause trouble.

220
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,880
But we fear nothing.

221
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,120
Wan'er. Linda and I won't come over.

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,760
We're working overtime tonight.

223
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,920
Okay, thank you for your effort.

224
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
No problem, bye-bye!

225
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,200
Bye-bye!

226
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,120
Amy and Linda went to watch the factory.

227
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,080
They won't come over tonight.

228
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
Okay.

229
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
- Aunt!
- Wan'er is here!

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
Come in quickly!

231
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Mom.

232
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,280
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

233
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
We felt there's nothing much fun abroad.

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
So, we came back early.

235
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,720
You bought so many things!

236
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,320
Luckily, I met this young man downstairs.

237
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,600
He helped me carry them up.

238
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,960
Aunt, so you're Vivi's mom!

239
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,320
I am Weiwei's employee and partner.

240
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
Who's he?

241
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,560
He is Weiwei's new apprentice.

242
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,080
Also major in fashion design.

243
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
What about Li?

244
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
He...

245
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
- Aunt.
- Li...

246
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Your skin looks even better.

247
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,180
And you've become more beautiful!

248
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Li always knows how to flatter.

249
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,760
I'll make you more delicious dishes.

250
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,760
Just a moment, and it won't be long.

251
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,640
Okay!

252
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
- You and Li now...
- Mom!

253
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll help him!

254
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,240
I see Li as my son-in-law.

255
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm so happy about him!

256
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,800
Aunt, but...

257
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,920
Isn't Mr. Li

258
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,600
Weiwei's boyfriend?

259
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,520
Aunt, we'll go back first.

260
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,430
- Okay.
- Bye, Aunt.

261
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

262
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,680
You should go back now.

263
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,240
It isn't very easy.

264
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,120
It's difficult for her to take in.

265
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
Fine.

266
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,620
I understand.

267
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,200
We're leaving.

268
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
Okay.

269
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,480
When did this happen?

270
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
Before you went abroad.

271
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
Why do you let me know

272
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,280
such a hard story at this moment?

273
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,480
And pretended that nothing happened.

274
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
Is this guy still bothering you now?

275
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm telling you that

276
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
you two can't reconcile!

277
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
I won't agree to you being with him!

278
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
There's no reconciliation.

279
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
What the hell is it?!

280
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,440
Do you try to provoke me to death?

281
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,480
You can't reach this guy anymore!

282
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,840
You must keep your distance from him!

283
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
Do you hear me?

284
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,440
Mom!

285
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Maybe it's impossible.

286
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,560
He is now my investor.

287
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,350
- A shareholder.
- What?!

288
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Last night,

289
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
didn't Aunt give you a hard time?

290
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,520
I'm sorry, Weiwei.

291
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,520
I knew nothing about it.

292
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
What a complex relationship it is!

293
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
It's not your fault.

294
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,360
It's the new design.

295
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,640
Place an order for sample production.

296
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Take a look at it.

297
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
Go ahead.

298
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,400
Okay, I'll do it right now.

299
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,830
Zhang Ruichao was remanded in custody.

301
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,240
I don't care whatever it takes,

302
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,680
and you must find him out!

303
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
With everyone's effort,

304
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
our Starry Sky studio

305
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
is officially set up today!

306
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,800
- Good!
- Excellent!

307
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,760
Great!

308
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,120
Also, a big thank you to these customers

309
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,200
to support our business

310
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,440
on our opening day!

311
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
Thank you!

312
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,000
From design to production,

313
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,720
everything is domestically made!

314
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,280
I hope we can truly achieve Made in China!

315
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,990
-Good!
-Wonderful!

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
