19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,650
You're awake.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,880
Morning.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Put it on.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Are you shy?

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
And,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,120
since yesterday, there have been

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,800
many suppliers are reaching me.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,120
The rain has just stopped.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
Let's go and examine them.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
Okay.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Hurry up!

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Be careful!

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,960
Let's work later.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Many guys involved are waiting.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
We can't delay.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Besides,

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,720
I have you to protect me.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,760
Wan'er called me.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,980
It should be news from the factory.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
(Tang Weiwei)

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,400
(If you hadn't betrayed my brother)

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,840
(How great it would be)

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Mr. Tang, please come in.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,000
You can take a look around.

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
These are all processed by our factory.

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
These are the latest models.

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
This way, please.

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,960
These have been very popular recently.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Take a look!

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Mr. Tang.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,800
Let me recommend something to you.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,400
We made sort of materials.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
It's called Moni.

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
It's not much worse than Tian Song.

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,080
I touched it, and it's really nice.

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
But,

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Tian Song is our priority this time, and

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,800
we won't consider others.

57
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Mr. Tang.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
Rarity increases value.

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,440
Now, Tian Song

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
is 30% more expensive

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
than usual.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,640
Director, I think

63
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,920
it doesn't make sense.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Because the price…

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,520
it's really way over budget!

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,240
Just now, when I was at the door,

67
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,390
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wang called and said

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,040
they hope we can visit their factory.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
How about going there?

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,320
I almost forgot it.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,750
Sorry, boss.

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,950
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
The thing is

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,040
the quantity is large, and

75
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,400
they're highly needed.

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Suppose, if your stock is complete,

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
and the price is also ok,

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,520
we'll order what you produce.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Right.

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,080
How urgent must that be?

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,480
Once it's decided, we can

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
immediately pay the deposit.

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,280
But,

84
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,880
I'm afraid our company

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,560
won't agree with the price.

86
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,680
Sorry, there're still alternatives to go.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,240
Shall we cooperate next time?

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Let's go.

89
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
No.

90
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,480
Hold on.

91
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,320
Doing business

92
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,480
is not easy, either.

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
How about this?

94
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,040
Just 10% more expensive.

95
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
If you can accept it,

96
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,440
pay the deposit.

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,480
I'll then ship immediately.

98
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
The point is

99
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
it depends

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,960
on my director.

101
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,560
Just 10% more expensive?

102
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,240
- That's fine.
- That's ok.

103
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,840
Alright.

104
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,440
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

105
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,620
There was a bit of traffic on the road.

106
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,360
Doesn't matter.

107
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,680
Let's see what to eat.

108
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,920
I still have to thank Mr. Jiang

109
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,160
for providing me with the information.

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

111
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,760
See what you want to eat.

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,840
Let's talk about our matters.

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,240
What matters could we have?

114
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
How about we order first?

115
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,720
We'd go separate ways after dinner.

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
I will take responsibility for you.

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,440
Responsible?

118
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
No need.

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,560
We're all adults, right?

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
President Jiang doesn't need to

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,600
make such a big deal out of it?

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,560
Qu Wan'er, you...

123
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,720
What do you mean?

124
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,600
What do you take me for?

125
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Well... Yes.

126
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
It's all my fault.

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
I think

128
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,440
he seems to have lost his appetite.

129
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,120
How about leaving first?

130
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
We'll meet again if fate allows.

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you doing?

132
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
You won't go back on your word, will you?

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
That depends on how you behave.

134
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,520
What are you thinking about?

135
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,160
Why is your smile so disgusting?

136
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,440
Li Shu and I

137
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
have been a couple now.

138
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
What?

139
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,140
Come on, let me know the details!

140
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
It is

141
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
like what you imagined.

142
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,480
What do you mean?

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
That's where you're wrong.

144
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,680
We're in the honeymoon phase now.

145
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,120
You two should be like

146
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,360
a blazing fire.

147
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Under the moon and flowers,

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,240
you fall deeply in love.

149
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,320
Is it because that boy is too immature?

150
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,480
I said it!

151
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,080
Too young is still not good!

152
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
How about this?

153
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
Next time,

154
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll teach him how to do it.

155
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
- When it comes...
- Enough.

156
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
Full of dirty thoughts!

157
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,000
Is this how you treat your benefactor?

158
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,320
I told you about where my factory is.

159
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Yes!

160
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,160
This time, you are

161
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,240
really reliable!

162
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,560
But it's not the way

163
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,240
you do things.

164
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Speak out!

165
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Who told you where the factory is?

166
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
What are you looking at?

167
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Come on and say something.

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,040
It's time to go to work.

169
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,280
Go back now.

170
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,640
Insane!

171
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,000
You planned to help her.

172
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Why did you tip it off

173
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
with the help of me?

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
I just fear

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,400
she'd affect the whole division.

176
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,720
You apparently wanted to help her.

177
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,780
I don't.

178
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,280
Have you

179
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,640
fallen in love with her?

180
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Shiyu has been gone for a long time.

181
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
You should move on, too.

182
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,640
But can I really let it go?

183
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
She had an affair with others.

184
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,000
That caused my brother's death.

185
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,360
Had an affair with others?

186
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,520
Did she admit it herself?

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,320
Could it be...

188
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,080
Some misunderstandings?

189
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,960
But I have photos.

190
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
What can photos prove?

191
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,360
You've been by her side for so long.

192
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,760
Do you think she's that kind of person?

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,210
Since you've been caught in the middle,

194
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,960
you need to make it clear,

195
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,920
seeing what really happened back then.

196
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
Li Shu.

197
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
What's wrong?

198
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,800
Close your eyes.

199
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,600
Come.

200
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,360
Okay.

201
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
You bought it?

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,200
I found you really favored it.

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,520
I just saw it that day.

204
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,480
So I bought it back.

205
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,640
How cute it is!

206
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,040
Isn't it?

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,840
Every time I saw it,

208
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
I bought it back to you.

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Okay.

210
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,740
What's wrong?

211
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Thank you.

212
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
You had some drinks?

213
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
Weiwei.

214
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,880
Do you love me?

215
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,440
Of course!

216
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,320
And,

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,920
meanwhile,

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,280
would you have an affair with others?

219
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
Of course not!

220
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,960
Why do you say so?

221
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,400
(Weiwei)

222
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
(Can I really trust you?)

223
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,200
For the next one month,

224
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
we'd focus on

225
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,640
(Weekly Meeting)
factory affairs

226
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
and feedback on Gengdi.

227
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,280
Mr. Zhang.

228
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,520
Didn't you sleep well last night, huh?

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,840
It's a big company.

230
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,280
Many things are about to occupy me.

231
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
They're strangers to you guys.

232
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
By the way,

233
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,000
and today,

234
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
(Meeting Room)
one thing comes out.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
Mr. Zhang!

236
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,120
I forgot to let you guys know about it.

237
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,080
This is Michelle.

238
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
A very talented guy.

239
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
From today,

240
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,360
she'll be in charge of Design Department 2.

241
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,360
The Design Department 2?

242
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Hello, everyone.

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
I am Xu Jing.

244
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,200
You can also call me Michelle.

245
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm the new director.

246
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,640
Mr. Zhang.

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,160
What does it mean?

248
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,640
Since you've set up a new division,

249
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,200
are newcomers under your consideration?

250
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
Vivian.

251
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,680
I planned to pick some of our veterans

252
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,920
for this new division

253
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,320
based on

254
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,400
the existing design department.

255
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,790
Right.

256
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Michelle is right.

257
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,050
From now on, you should get along well,

258
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
and work together.

259
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
Strive to make our fashion design department

260
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,870
flourish and grow,

261
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,720
going out into the world.

262
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,800
It's today's regular meeting.

263
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
That's all.

264
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
Meeting adjourned.

265
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,240
Weiwei.

266
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
Please guide me in the coming days.

267
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,880
It's not about guidance.

268
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,200
After all, we all have our KPIs.

269
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
I'd ask you to

270
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,280
check it out,

271
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,120
so as not to delay the progress.

272
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,400
Of course!

273
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,120
Cora.

274
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Kevin.

275
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
Linda.

276
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,800
Wait in the meeting room for me.

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,840
As for you,

278
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,400
do you have a name?

279
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
Li Shu.

280
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,800
Li Shu.

281
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,400
Sounds pretty good.

282
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
Join them, waiting in the meeting room.

283
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
I still have things to do.

284
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
You are now part of my team.

285
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,840
It's on me about what to do.

286
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,200
I won't go there.

287
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
You are now part of my team.

288
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,400
I want you to go to the meeting room.

289
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,360
I said I won't go there.

290
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
You!

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
Sister.

292
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,680
Come in.

293
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,720
What's wrong?

294
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm telling you that

295
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,960
Xu Jing, that arrogant woman,

296
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,280
called Cola

297
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
Kevin, Linda, and Xiao Li

298
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,960
to a meeting.

299
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,000
I think

300
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,190
she doesn't have good intentions.

301
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,890
She wants a whole new division.

302
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,180
Just go and have newcomers.

303
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,040
How could someone be so poached?!

304
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,660
Forget it!

305
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
Let's wait and see.

306
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,150
What capabilities could she have?

307
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,940
Be capable of seducing?

308
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,500
