Come this way!

20

Take your seat!

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,800
Hide for a moment!

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
He failed to follow our steps.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,360
You even got the nerve splash!

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,370
Why are you still running?

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,480
I don't have time for the prologue.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,760
Splash him, and it'll be all over.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
You just put in on.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,680
I want you to have it.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Today,

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,280
why did you suddenly show up?

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,280
I saw you leaving the company in a hurry.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,520
I could roughly guess what might happen.

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
So, I went after you.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Actually,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,360
there's no misunderstanding at all!

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,810
They just want to steal from our show,

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,560
using it as a stepping stone

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
to increase the brand's visibility.

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,800
So, what should we do then?

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,960
What do you plan to do?

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,280
Go for more to prove ourselves.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,040
Before the hard evidence,

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,440
these are all just excuses!

44
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,890
My dear director,

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
eat first!

46
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,280
Put work aside for a moment.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,160
Is what I presented enough?

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,040
The way of posting is under discussion.

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
After all, the creative matters,

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,520
it's hard to take their chips down.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,840
I also have a presentation.

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,120
Just relax.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Leave it to our PR Dep.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400
Well...

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,520
Or I'd ask Amy for an explanation.

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,000
You signed a life-long contract?

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
Worked overtime for a whole day!

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,520
But you're still talking about work.

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Then, what else to talk about?

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,280
I heard

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,280
Li Shu came here for just one day.

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,960
He won much favor because of

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,160
his interpersonal skills and ability.

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,840
He's still working overtime with you.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,040
It seems

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,680
he really has feelings for you!

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
Still outside now?

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,560
Why don't you give him a chance?

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
That also means a chance for you, too.

71
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,160
Stop it!

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
I think you left your work unfinished.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,320
Mr. Zhang hasn't signed them, right?

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Who has so much free time?

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Fine!

76
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,760
No wonder you don't have a companion!

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Enjoy your meal alone!

78
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,080
Your first day here, still working overtime?

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,240
Amy assigned you so much work, right?

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,520
I'm getting proofs for you.

81
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,680
I want to help you.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,560
Look!

83
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,700
(Design Department)

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
I've been on it all day long

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
to get these things

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
for you.

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,520
The guy in charge of the IDMV

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,680
whose previous works

89
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,370
are mainly in the French country style.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,840
Look at these things.

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
But what's strange is

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,080
what they posted this time

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,360
are completely different from old ones

94
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,300
in terms of brushstrokes.

95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
What does it mean?

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,520
You want to

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,160
prove ourselves through design style?

98
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
(You thought the same as I did.)

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
(It seems he's something.)

100
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,360
Good job!

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,360
To me and CC PR Dep.

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,120
Really?

103
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,560
Then can I ask for a reward?

104
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,420
What is that?

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
I want to go home with you.

106
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Sure!

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,200
No, you can't!

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,960
You just said yes!

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
You said sure!

110
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,640
I...

111
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,420
(Design Department)

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,520
Hello!

113
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you Ms. Jiang Mi?

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Li Shu!

115
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,080
Li Shu, I texted you many times!

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,560
Why didn't you reply?

117
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,840
I've been working overtime...

118
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I didn't check my phone.

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,480
Are you

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
Li Shu's boss, right?

121
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,160
Why did you assign him so much work?

122
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,640
Sorry, Miss Jiang

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
I wasn't told someone was awaiting him.

124
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
Sorry about delaying your date.

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,000
No, it's not a date.

126
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,880
We are just college classmates.

127
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,180
We've known each other for a long time.

128
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,920
It may change in the future.

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Miss Jiang.

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Today is his first day at work.

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
He indeed won much favor from us.

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Good to know about him!

133
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Right?

134
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm telling you that

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,560
he was really impressive back then.

136
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Please, stop the nonsense!

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,960
I still have to work overtime later.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,320
How about going back home first?

139
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,640
Li Shu!

140
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,600
Jiang, are you available later?

141
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
If possible,

142
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,360
please feel free to come to my office

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,480
for some chats.

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,040
I think your rizz perfectly suits

145
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,800
our products for the next season.

146
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm not in a hurry at all!

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
This way, please.

148
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,160
About Qing Yu,

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
I think it's not a stranger to you.

150
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,560
Our goal is high-end luxury fashion design.

151
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,600
At first glance,

152
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,760
mountains of

153
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,990
wild peonies suddenly occurred to me.

154
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,480
Rich in beauty with a hint of sweetness.

155
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
In line with your rizz,

156
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
it perfectly aligns with our 2025 design

157
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,780
without prior consultation.

158
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,200
Li Shu, what do you think?

159
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes, you said it, and

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
a high degree of compatibility.

161
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,320
Miss Jiang, trust me.

162
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,960
You're definitely the right fit for us.

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,010
She said it!

164
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,200
I want Li Shu for the following issues.

165
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,080
- I...
- No problem!

166
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,560
Li?

167
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,200
I told you that it's all on you!

168
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,240
No problem!

169
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,160
Okay!

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,160
Why are you here?

171
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,280
Didn't you take Jiang Mi back?

172
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,550
Yes.

173
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,440
After that, I just came back to you.

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Alright.

175
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
Actually, I told you before.

176
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,200
It's an accident.

177
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,480
Then it happened.

178
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,520
After that,

179
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,360
things will go back on track, right?

180
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,480
- Sister!
- Well...

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,200
Is it because of Jiang Mi?

182
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,440
She's really my college classmate.

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
I have only you in my heart.

184
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't mean that.

185
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,320
We're strangers, not a couple.

186
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,120
So,

187
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,520
you want to leave me alone?

188
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,920
I think someone in your age

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
should focus on their career

190
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,480
with all their time and energy.

191
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Instead of...

192
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,680
I understand.

193
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,160
I'll work harder.

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
Even if it's truly for you,

195
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,880
I'll try to stay at this place.

196
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,440
(That's not exactly what I meant.)

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Sister.

198
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm sorry, sister.

199
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
It's chilly.

200
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,160
Let me take you home.

201
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
No need.

202
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
I can go back myself.

203
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
And,

204
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
it'll be the end of what we spoke of.

205
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,200
Don't keep entangling.

206
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
If you feel like you've suffered a loss,

207
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,940
- what do you want?
- Sister...

208
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,000
I never thought

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
to do anything to hurt you.

210
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
Are you hungry?

211
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
Yes.

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Then...

213
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
Grab something to eat together?

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,920
Sure, something I've been longing for.

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Have some sweet potatoes!

216
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
It's so late.

217
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,540
Are you sure we're about to have it?

218
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Yummy! Have a taste!
