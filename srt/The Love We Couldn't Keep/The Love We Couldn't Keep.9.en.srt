=Episode 9=

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,200
I've got a full schedule today.

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
I can't spare you much time.

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,990
Sorry.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm not here for some chats.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Check your WeChat.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,740
(Order: Some Requirements)

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,960
I think I can challenge the leader,

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
taking over his place.

27
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,190
What is this?

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,320
A big order.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,880
Gengdi is about to be in China.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
They want a local brand for co-branding.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,280
Gengdi?

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,400
Absolutely true!

33
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,400
That's great!

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
If we can cut a deal with it,

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,920
it'll help Qingyu gain much visibility,

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
also good for our internationalization.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Exactly!

38
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,880
But, a competitive bidding is needed.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,440
Their requirements are very simple.

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
To emphasize Chinese characteristics.

41
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Director Tang,

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,320
are you confident to take it?

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
You've done your part quite well.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,720
How could we not seize the chance?

45
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,580
Counting on you.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Amy, Gengdi came here yesterday

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
for the details of the collaboration.

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
Did you know that?

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,920
Vivian, my friend told me that

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,520
Gengdi went to their place

51
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
for some details of the collaboration.

52
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,120
Alright, and we don't force things.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,040
I need to confirm it.

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay.

55
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,500
Hello!

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Liliy!

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,640
I heard about your company...

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,360
Do you know who handled the Gengdi issue?

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Who is that guy?

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
Doukou!

61
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,680
Doukou?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Are you sure?

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,240
If it were Doukou,

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,560
we definitely have no chance!

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Yesterday, people from Gengdi

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,160
went to Doukou for a face-to-face talk.

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,840
I want to go home and catch up on sleep.

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
There's no chance left for us!

69
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,010
Exactly!

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
What do we have to compete with Doukou?

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,280
Making a wedding dress doesn't count!

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Not even making sure before bidding?

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
Isn't it wreaking havoc on us?

74
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,200
Yes, exactly!

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Enough.

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,480
What are you afraid of?

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,280
I know she has a young lover.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Li Shu.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
We have been in contact with Gengdi.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,720
(Doukou (Business))
But unconfirmed.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
Yesterday, Gengdi's men went to Doukou

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
for a good conversation.

83
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,200
As long as there's no contract and payment,

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,440
we still have a chance.

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,590
Set up a meeting with their business team.

86
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,920
Try to meet their boss,

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
having a face-to-face talk.

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
Alright.

89
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm really impressed.

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,280
Our leaders

91
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,720
are all like hidden talents.

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,260
They still want us to work overtime for

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,680
projects that were predetermined long ago.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
So annoying!

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,880
Qiu Wan'er from PR should handle it!

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,140
She's in charge of it, and

97
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
now there's such a big mess.

98
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
She can't shrink from responsibilities.

99
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,760
She's so good at seducing.

100
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,680
Didn't you see, at the last cocktail party

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,440
President Jiang from Jiang Media

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
couldn't take his eyes off her?

103
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
What are you doing?

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,480
Let go of me!

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm tired of this nonsense!

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
I'm telling you that

107
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,960
they must have an affair with each other.

108
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,040
Or, why did Jiang Mi make it so fast?

109
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,400
She should be chosen to do it.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
Send her to seduce the boss and then

111
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
wouldn't it be solved, would it?

112
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Do you think Gengdi's boss is desperate?

113
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,330
Were you just talking about Manager Qu?

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
We just had some chats.

115
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,520
It's about whoever takes it personally.

116
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
Okay.

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,120
I was recording what you spoke of.

118
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,400
I give you two choices.

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
One,

120
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
you should quit yourselves.

121
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,520
And give me your words that

122
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,000
you won't spread rumors.

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Two,

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
it's about defamation.

125
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
I will hire the best lawyer

126
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,360
to ensure you're gonna rot in prison.

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Vivian, we were just joking!

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
Yes, joking. And don't be like that!

129
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,960
Choose one or two.

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Sorry!

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
We'll quit tomorrow.

132
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,760
Where did your usual arrogance go?

133
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm sick of arguing anymore.

134
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,760
We have so many members here.

135
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,760
Can I really shut each of them up?

136
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
Such a big heart?

137
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
But I'm in charge of PR.

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
And it's my daily routine.

139
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
If I were really that fragile,

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
one person with a mouthful of spit

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
could drown me!

142
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,380
(Meet and discuss the collaboration)

143
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,320
Tang, Gengdi's boss, wants to see us.

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
Really?

145
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
That's great!

146
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
My high performance can be delivered.

147
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
General Manager Fen.

148
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,840
Just leave me here.

149
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,600
Your proposal is very bold.

150
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
And also very innovative.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,960
I like it very much!

152
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
But for the final result,

153
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
it'll depend on your bidding.

154
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,540
Thank you for

155
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,120
leaving us a chance to bid.

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,240
As you said,

157
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,650
we'll definitely give it our all!

158
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,920
Looking forward to working with you!

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
Thank you.

160
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Then we'll take our leave.

161
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,760
I brought our previous design drafts

162
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
and went to Gengdi.

163
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,120
The boss over really favored our style

164
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,810
and granted us a chance to compete with

165
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,560
Doukou for the final co-branding rights.

166
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,240
- Yes.
- You're amazing!

167
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,560
You're impressive!

168
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
By the way, Li Shu,

169
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,840
you'd put all of our design drafts

170
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,820
together during this period.

171
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,560
I'll make some adjustments.

172
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
- Okay.
- Tomorrow at 10 AM.

173
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Wait in the meeting room for you all!

174
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,280
Why are you following me?

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm on the way.

176
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,400
On the way?

177
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm your new neighbor.

178
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,720
I just tidied up half of my house.

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,400
It seems like that's the case.

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
But I'm not usually this messy.

181
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,600
I can see it through.

182
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,040
It's indeed quite rushed.

183
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,480
I'll buy something

184
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,760
to make dishes for you.

185
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,360
Then,

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,560
I shall accept your offer.

187
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,120
Wei...

188
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,480
This...

189
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,120
It's dirty, and I haven't wiped it yet.

190
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,960
So you like wooden sculptures, huh?

191
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Yes!

192
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,200
I played with it when I was a child.

193
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,840
I saw it as an apple of my eye.

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,080
A gift for your birthday.

195
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,000
Brother,

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,720
come on, I've been in college!

197
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
You're still my younger brother.

198
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
You'll have it every year from now on.

199
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
Okay.

200
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,560
Did your ex-girlfriend give it to you?

201
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,520
My brother.

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,840
Do you have another brother?

203
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
I've never heard you speak of him.

204
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,600
He

205
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
passed away.

206
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,400
- I...
- It's okay.

208
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,480
Why don't you eat first?

209
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
It'll get cold soon.

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
