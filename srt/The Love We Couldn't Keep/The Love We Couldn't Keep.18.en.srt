I am Zeng Shiyu's younger brother.

49
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,670
I didn't know a car accident occurred

50
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
to him because of this.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
All these years,

52
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,630
I have also felt very guilty.

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,320
So, have you and Tang Weiwei ever...

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,320
No!

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,010
At that time,

56
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,080
someone gave me a sum of money

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
asking me to pursue her.

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,240
I was also momentarily bewitched.

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,680
I got it.

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,920
Thank you.

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,880
I almost...

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,880
I almost told her in person.

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,880
If you want to blame someone, blame me!

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,360
I told Director Tang about it.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,960
How odd I choose to blame you?

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,640
You spoke of the truth.

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,880
I don't want to see you in so much pain!

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
Let it go, please!

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,560
Look,

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,440
will Tang Weiwei ever forgive me?

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,840
Even if you got drunk to death,

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,720
she still wouldn't know.

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,120
Let alone forgive you!

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
Li Shu, don't be like this!

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,680
She said she never loved me!

78
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,760
In her heart,

79
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,120
there was only my brother!

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,880
But it's also good this way.

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
At least she won't suffer like I do.

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Since Shiyu passed away,

83
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
auntie's mental state has been poor.

84
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,920
That day, Shiyu came to you.

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,320
It was Li Shu who secretly let him go.

86

Zeng Shiyu tormented her for three years.

135
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,320
Yet she refuses to tell me anything.

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,240
What are you doing?

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,560
Isn't it just for a man?

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,080

149
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,560

158
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,360
(Let's put an end to it.)

159
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
(Weiwei)

160
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
(You must live a good life.)

161
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
Tang, you finally showed up!

162
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
You probably don't know

163
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,000
we received an anonymous email accusing

164
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,080
Zhang Ruichao's embezzlement,

165
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,360
molesting female subordinates,

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,640
abuse of power, and so on.

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,200
One accusation after another,

168
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,360
and too numerous to record!

169
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
We reported it directly to the police.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,240
Now,

171
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,000
he has already been fired!

172
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
Who did it?

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
Do you think

174
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,280
Li Shu might do so?

175
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,650
There's another piece of not-so-good news.

176
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,960
Xu Jing secured her job here.

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,320
I heard that

178
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,200
Zhang Ruichao

179
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,380
took all the blame upon himself.

180
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,000
He has now been released on bail.

181
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
This Xu Jing

182
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,960
has quite a lot of influence!

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,840
She's the wife of a major shareholder.

184
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
She rose to the top as a mistress!

185
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,130
These days, she officially got promoted.

186
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,340
So she had backing all along!

187
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,740
When will you marry into a wealthy family?

188
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,340
So that I, as your sister

189
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,540
can also benefit from it.

190
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,780
What's going on with you?

191
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,500
This is Mr. Li.

192
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,300
The shares of Jiang's and Zeng's

193
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,580
exceed 51%.

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,340
From today,

195
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,780
Mr. Li officially takes over as the GM.

196
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,820
Any questions?

197
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,500
Hello, Mr. Li!

198
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,120
Your design drafts are all quite good!

199
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,980
Excellent!

200
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,380
Especially Linda, particularly good!

201
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,660
Keep up the good work!

202
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,900
Thank you, Director.

203
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,860
Director,

204
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,860
I heard about the restaurant downstairs

205
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,740
newly opened is pretty good.

206
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,860
Shall we eat there someday?

207
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,110
You go ahead.

208
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,560
Send me the design drafts on time!

209
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,180
Okay!

210
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,140
Vivian.

211
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,140
About the previous matter,

212
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,860
there was a bit of a misunderstanding.

213
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,580
But it's been a thing of the past.

214
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,700
In the future, the two of us

215
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,940
still need to fight side by side.

216
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,140
Fighting side by side.

217
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,340
Zhang Ruichao forced me to do

218
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,780
what you spoke of.

219
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,620
I've been investigated thoroughly.

220
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,820
That's why I can secure my job

221
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,140
as the director of the No.2 Department.

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,500
Additionally, the company also plans to promote you

223
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,740
to the vice president.

224
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,060
I'll need to learn more from you.

225
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,060
Things like being coerced,

226
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,540
you have the nerve to speak out.

227
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,580
Working in the design department,

228
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,180
that's a bit of a waste of your talent.

229
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,060
Why not turn to become an actor?

230
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,980
Vivian!

231
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,060
Today, I came with a good attitude

232
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,460
to ask for reconciliation with you.

233
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,540
You should be reasonable!

234
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,300
Don't drag it out,

235
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,460
overstepping boundaries!

236
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,740
What a coincidence!

237
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,940
I'm here to resign today.

238
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,660
Your performance

239
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,980
is somewhat wasted!

240
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,300
People are acting,

241
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,380
god is watching.

242
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,860
I advise you

243
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,140
to fend for yourself!

244
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,100
(Qu Wan'er, have you eaten?)

245
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,620
(Are you hungry?)

246
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,100
(Qu Wan'er)

247
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,420
(Qu Wan'er)

248
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,580
Wan'er

249
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,780
Wan...

250
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,580
Tang.

251
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,220
Wait for me!

252
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,020
What are you doing?

253
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,100
I'll go with you.

254
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,940
For a company like this,

255
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,910
it's better not to stay.

256
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,400
