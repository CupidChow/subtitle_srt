(Qingyu Design)
I have to say

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,320
as I spoke of it,

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,680
you can't add too much Tian Song

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,200
to Geng Di's design.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Look, it's all messed up!

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,880
There's a heavy rainstorm in Guangzhou.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Tian Song is all flooded out there!

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,080
What should we do now?

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Mr. Zhang.

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Relax.

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
I'd go to Guangzhou for alternatives.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,160
Hopefully,

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,880
you'll find a way out.

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,560
And,

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,720
if you have things you can't handle,

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,320
just let me know.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
No need.

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll do my best to solve it.

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,080
Please don't worry.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,720
I will go right now.

40
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,480
Zhang Ruichao is really a jerk!

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
He strongly recommended Tian Song!

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,840
He's not only shirking responsibility,

43
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,200
but also getting handsy with you!

44
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,240
Hasn't he always been like this?

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,360
We're not at the end of our rope yet!

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,640
Let's give it another try!

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,600
Alright, I'll also work on it.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,860
I'll let you know if there's any news.

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,640
How about taking Li Shu with you?

50
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
No need.

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
I can manage.

52
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,840
- Hello, Boss Li.
- Hello.

53
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
Can you deliver more Tian Song?

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,840
No, we can't.

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
It's raining heavily in Guangzhou.

56
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,440
The typhoon is coming.

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
More than half a month earlier!

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,690
I can't do what you requested.

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay, thank you!

60
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Boss Zhou.

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
May I ask if you have more Tian Song?

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
- Yes!
- How many are left?

63
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Whatever you ask, it'll be ok!

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
Great, then I'll fly to Guangzhou today!

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,920
Can I visit your factory tomorrow?

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Of course, you can!

67
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Reach me as soon as you're here.

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,440
Okay, thank you, see you tomorrow!

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
Alright.

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,400
Amy.

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,390
Book me a flight to Guangzhou.

72
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,800
If not, a high-speed train is fine, too!

73
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Alright.

74
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
Come in.

75
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,080
Are you going to Guangzhou?

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,560
Do you know the typhoon is out there?

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
We don't have any replenishments!

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,480
It'll seriously slow down our plans!

79
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,960
Do you know how dangerous it is now?

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,440
Haven't you watched the news?

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
I won't allow you to go!

82
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,710
Li Shu!

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,660
You can't be childish at this moment!

84
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,960
Childish?

85
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Do you think I'm naive?

86
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm worried about you!

87
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,650
You can go.

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,240
But risk your life just for work?

89
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,080
I must take responsibility for it.

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360
Fine!

91
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Do as you wish!

92
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
The user you are calling...

94
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,960
Answer the phone!

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Tang,

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
is everything all right?

97
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,680

(School suspension)
or extremely heavy rains.

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
Gusts of wind reaching levels 13 to 15.

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
Please take precautions against them.

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480

Hey, Boss Zhou!

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
You finally answered the phone!

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,840
Shall I come to check the goods?

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
No, the rain suddenly got heavy!

120
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,680
The workers have all gone off-duty!

121
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm not there either!

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,080
Let's take a rain check.

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,120
Sorry.

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm really anxious to confirm it!

125
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,360
Could you please make an exception?

126
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
It's not about making an exception.

127
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,480
My house is flooded.

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,720
I can't take care of the factory.

129
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
Why don't you try another?

130
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560

Are you her...

140
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
I am her...

141
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,640
I am her husband.

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,560
The last digits of my ID card are 12671.

143
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
We quarreled.

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,920
Hello, we cannot tip it off.

145
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,840
As for Ms. Tang,

146
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
I just checked, and

147
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
she's indeed staying here.

148
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
This is your room, 606.

149
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Okay, thank you.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,720
It's temporarily unavailable.

152
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,440

153
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,560
Answer!

154
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,280
Weiwei!

155
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,600
Weiwei, can you hear me? Where are you?

156
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Yes, I can hear you.

157
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,760
I'm currently at..., going to...

158
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
- What noises?
- To find Boss Zhou.

159
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
- Don't come.
- Can you hear me?

160
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,600
- Weiwei.
- The car stalled.

161
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Car...

162
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
The car stalled!

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,680
Give me your real-time location.

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,200
Send me your location.

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
- I also...
- Can you hear me?

166
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,400
Bad signal.

167
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,400
Send me your location.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know where I am.

169
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,880
Just on the way to Boss Zhou's factory.

170
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,240
Don't come!

171
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,400
You...

172
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Then you send...

173
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Weiwei!

174
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,040
Will we always be together?

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Of course!

176
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,000
Once we could have our home,

177
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
there'll be a dog inside,

178
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
and also a cat.

179
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay?

180
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,160
Okay!

181
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Shiyu!

182
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
Is it you?

183
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,000
You came back, Shi Yu?

184
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Weiwei.

185
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,520
I came to say goodbye to you!

186
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
No!

187
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's all my fault!

189
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
I threw a tantrum back then.

190
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,480
I didn't make it clear to you.

191
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,520
I broke up out of a momentary pique.

192
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,040
Shiyu, I shouldn't have let you go!

193
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Stop weeping.

195
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,640
If so, you make me concerned.

196
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
No.

197
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Shiyu.

198
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
Shiyu, I was wrong!

199
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
Please forgive me!

200
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,040
Don't go, come back!

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,760
I miss you so much!

202
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,480
It's dawn.

203
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
I have to go!

204
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
No!

205
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,640
Don't, Shiyu!

206
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,600
I don't want you to leave!

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,960
Take good care of yourself.

208
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't go!

209
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,240
I have to go.

210
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,000
No!

211
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
Please, don't...

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
I don't want you to leave, Shiyu!

213
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,640
Shiyu!

214
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,040
- Weiwei!
- Shiyu!

215
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
Weiwei!

216
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,600
Weiwei!

217
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Weiwei!

218
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,210
Weiwei...

219
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
Wei...

220
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm late.

221
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Are you okay?

222
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,520
Fine.

223
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,960
Didn't I tell you not to come?

224
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,280
So headstrong!

225
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,520
You went so far alone.

226
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,680
I'm worried about you.

227
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,480
Can it work if I don't come over?

228
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,560
Don't look at me like that!
