Perhaps,

170
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,140
shall we check our timelines,

171
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
and see

172
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,100

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,340
we stole your design.

180
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,980
Then, you have to show us your proof.

181
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,980
Or, it should be malicious defamation.
