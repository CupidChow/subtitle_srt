00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,150
That's good.

so you can look forward to the future.

I feel

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,560
I might really be in love with Li Shu.

Mom.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,960
Shiyu.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
You're back.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,560
Come.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Mom.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not your brother.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm Shu.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
Look at me.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
Are you Li Shu?

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,320
Yes!

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,120
So you're not Shiyu.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,880
Your brother will never come back.

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,240
- Mom.
- It's Tang Weiwei!

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,160
Could there be some misunderstandings?

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,760
I mean

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,400
Tang Weiwei is not that kind of woman.

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,000
Why would you mention that woman?

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
Did you go to see her?

46
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,480
I did not.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Did you go to find her?

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
Mom, I really didn't.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,240
Has she bewitched you?

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,880
Mom!

51
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
Calm down!

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,600
I have never gone to see her!

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,440
You must stay away from that woman!

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,920
I only have you now.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,320
I can't lose you again!

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,760
Or, you're forcing me to die!

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
Alright.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
I promise you

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,960
I will!

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
(Tang Weiwei,)

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,000
(We are destined not to be together.)

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Tang Weiwei,

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,920
you used inferior Tian Song to save money!

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, Geng Di has already called

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,560
the chairman.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,080
How is that possible?

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,480
We both inspected the goods back then!

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,280
Stop talking nonsense!

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Now Geng Di is accusing us

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,840
and demanding we pay for it!

71
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,960
You must take full responsibility!

72
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,600
Mr. Zhang, relax.

73
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Give me some time. I can manage.

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,990
How else can this be investigated clearly?

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,320
You should be in full charge of it.

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,520
So what you mean is

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,120
to fire me, that's

78
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
to protect the entire department?

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
If this matter escalates,

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,720
not only is Vivian's reputation at stake,

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,520
but the reputation of Qingyu!

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,520
For the sake of the company,

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
I have the authority to do so.

84
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay.

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,040
If you are willing to resign,

86
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
and considering your years of service,

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
for the sake of the company,

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
I can subsidize you with

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,360
six months' salary.

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Please do it as soon as possible.

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
Complete the handover with Michelle.

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,240
(Current company)

93
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
(It's okay not to stay)

94
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
(But even if I have to leave the company)

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,280
(I want to leave with a clear conscience)

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Michelle, you'll still take the lead

97
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,400
within the design department.

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,920
Vivian made such a big mess this time.

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,920
The entire design department will suffer.

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,760
She was only asked to resign!

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,320
That's too easy on her!

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,480
Vivian had good intentions, too.

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,080
Wanted to save money for the company.

104
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,160
It's just a quick fix.

105
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,320
It's really short-sighted!

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,840
Exactly, as you said.

107
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
I know something more.

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
Speak quickly.

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Vivian,

110
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,920
you're really something!

111
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
At this point,

112
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
still have the nerve to stay!

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
Of course!

114
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,520
Geng Di's matter is not all over.

115
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
Don't worry.

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
I will definitely find out the trick.

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
By the way,

118
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
just a reminder for you,

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
be careful!

120
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,080
Take care of yourself!

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,120
As for Zhang,

122
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
who knows?!

123
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
I don't believe it.

124
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
She left.

125
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,260
(Li Shu)

126
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,160
It's weird!

127
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,120
Why is there no news at all?

128
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,760
Are you saying

129
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,720
you're asked to admit your mistakes,

130
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,960
but the company doesn't investigate?

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes!

132
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,000
Zhang Ruichao insists on it.

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
He just needs an attitude.

134
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,760
Isn't this too obvious?!

135
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,360
You can't take the blame for this!

136
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Of course!

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
I will definitely clear my name!

138
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
By the way, Wan'er.

139
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
As for the contract,

140
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,680
I still need you to make a backup.

141
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Leave it to me.

142
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,840
After this matter is officially over,

143
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,520
I plan to resign from the company.

144
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
I support you!

145
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,280
The company is in chaos now.

146
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,280
It's better not to stay!

147
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
Li Shu.

148
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,240
Are you at home?

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm at your door now.

Then give her two more days.

193

If she is unwilling to resign,

194
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,000
then don't blame me for being rude!

195
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,880

200
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,600
I would get what I got today.

201
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
As for such a company,

202
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
it's better not to stay!

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,000
Come on, tonight,

204
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,320
we won't go home until we're drunk!

Today,

210
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
I now announce,

Xu Jing and Zhang Ruichao,

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,320
I will obstruct with all my might,

214
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
destroying them completely!

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Set traps and play dirty tricks!

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
I won't let them have a good time!

217
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,040
I should remember today,

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,920
and constantly remind myself that

219
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,400
I'd never endure this!

220
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
