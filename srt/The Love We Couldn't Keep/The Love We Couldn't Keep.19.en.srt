Come.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,360
Let's celebrate our departure from Qingyu.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,560
=Episode 19=
Get rid of them!

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,560
Cheers!

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
But to be honest,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,800
you don't have to go this far for me.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,520
I saw your plan at your house that day.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
After that,

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,360
I just felt at ease!

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,120
Have you

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,960
hooked up to another partner,

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,040
then, leaving me alone?

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,520
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,120
Actually,

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,240
all along,

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,360
no matter what decisions you make,

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
you've been by my side,

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
supporting me, whatever it takes!

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Wan'er,

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,920
thank you.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
We're best friends.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,480
Why are you being so sentimental?

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,720
In the future,

41
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,720
you focus on domestic affairs,

42
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,900
and I'll handle the outside things to

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,840
build our business empire!

44
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,880
Okay!

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,040
To the business empire!

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,720
Who are you?

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
I am the landlord of this house.

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,360
When did he move out?

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Today!

50
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,080
Young people are

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,440
never consistent!

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,600
Move out as they wish!

53
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,240
Girl, do you have any friends

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,040
looking to rent a house?

55
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
No!

56
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,600
No, not at all!

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, goodbye then.

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
(Moved away.)

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
(That's fine, too.)

60
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,900
(Mr. Jiang)

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,110
Go ahead.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
I can manage.

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,280
Tang.

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
Relax.

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
I really can do it!

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
Go ahead.

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
Go now!

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,000
Then, I'm leaving.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
Go ahead.

70
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
See you tomorrow.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,660
Hello.

72
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,080
Hello, Weiwei.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,650
Have you had a lot of fun?

74
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,040
Why did you get to call me?

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
Well... Mind your tongue.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,640
I have something to discuss with you.

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,680
It's...

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Speak, and I'm working overtime.

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,480
I've been with Uncle Wang

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,320
for quite some time.

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,480
He proposed to me today.

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,320
I agreed with him.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
That's great!

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
And then,

85
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,080
we want to take the chance to travel

86
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,400
around the world because we're healthy.

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Sure, as long as you're happy.

88
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
But,

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
if so, it'll be a long time.

90
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280
I just want to have a meal with

91
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,420
you and Li before

92
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,260
departure.

93
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
Well, Mom...

94
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,120
Li Shu and I...

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,360
Uncle Wang is calling.

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
I'll hang up now.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
See you tomorrow night.

98
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll have a group chat,
sending you the location later.

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Bye-bye.

100
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,360
(A Loving Family)
Tomorrow at 5:30,

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
don't miss it.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
I'll send the address later.

103
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
(Li Shu)
Okay.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,040
(Forget it, just a meal!)

105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,680
(Better not upset her.)

106
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Come on.

107
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
Have some.

108
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,700
(Live-Stream)
Just eat first.

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm now coming to a head.

110
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,400
Besides,

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,520
I haven't forgiven you yet.

112
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,620
(Live Stream)

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
You want to be in a live-stream field?

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,600
Don't underestimate me.

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
Our company this year

116
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,840
just ventured into this field.

117
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
And now all the data shows

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,280
it's a good trend.

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,400
Do you want to have chats with

120
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
our Operations Director?

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,320
Really?

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
I mean it.

123
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
So now,

124
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
have you forgiven me a little?

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,240
There is

126
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,520
a little bit.

127
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,800
Now, eat.

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Have this.

129
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Yummy!

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
When I was in my school days,

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,960
I used those firecrackers to

132
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
blow up that septic tank.

133
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,760
- Really?
- I mean it.

134
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
I threw it in there, and then

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,120
boom, it exploded!

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
Everything flew up to the sky!

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
Weiwei.

138
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
Why did you come so late?

139
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Mom.

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
I worked overtime today.

141
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,040
So I came late.

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
It's okay.

143
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
Li told me everything.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,180
You quit your job to start a business.

145
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,240
But you told me nothing about it.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
I fear you'd be worried about me.

147
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,840
Now, Li is taking care of you.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
What do I have to worry about?

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,200
But you've really lost a lot of weight.

150
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
Li has also lost weight.

151
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,640
How about this?

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll return the tickets,

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,960
stay and take care of you two?

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,640
No need. You should go out and have fun.

155
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,760
Yes. We can take good care of ourselves.

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
Really?

157
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,840
Look, you guys.

158
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,640
Have you quarreled?

159
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,240
No, not at all!

160
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Auntie.

161
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,240
It really is my fault.

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
She started her business and got tired.

163
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
I care less about her.

164
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,240
Relax, and I won't let it happen again.

165
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,720
Just leave it to me.

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,320
From tomorrow,

168
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,840
report your three meals to me.

169
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,040
Although I'm abroad, I'll ask about it.

170
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
- Okay.
- No need, Mom.

171
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Auntie, it's no problem.

172
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Leave it to me.

173
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
Li's words made me feel at ease.

174
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Okay!

175
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,320
Waiter, serve the dishes!

176
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
Open the door!

177
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,680
Open the door!

178
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
Weiwei.

179
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,880
Weiwei!

180
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,040
Weiwei!

181
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
Weiwei!

182
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,320
Can I embrace you again?

183
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,640
Let me go!

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,640
Let go of your hands!

185
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
I told you what I should say.

186
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
Weiwei.

187
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
I really...

188
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,760
Do you think we are doomed to be parted?

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,280
You got hurt many times because of me.

190
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
Weiwei, I'm willing to do so.

191
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,200
Stay away from water these days.

192
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
Alright.

193
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
- It's getting late.
- You'd better

194
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,040
go back and rest.

195
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,240
Okay.

196
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,880
You go to bed early.

197
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,400
Good night.

198
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,880
Thank you.

(Weiwei)

200
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
(Even if we can't be a couple,)

201
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,160
(just let me shield you.)

202
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,720
Who is that?

203
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,040
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

204
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Actually,

205
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
you don't have to listen to my mom.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
She asked me to take good care of you.

207
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
We can't afford to upset her.

208
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,840
Can I take a look?

209
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay.

210
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,920
Tang, I'm telling you that

211
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
the investors were really cunning.

212
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
And he was truly

213
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,320
petty!

214
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,000
