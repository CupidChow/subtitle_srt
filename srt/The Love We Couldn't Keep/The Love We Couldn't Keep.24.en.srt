Shu, what's wrong with you?

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,760
Quickly, call an ambulance!

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,800
Come on, make a call!

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
- Okay!
- Shu, what's wrong?

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Li Shu, wake up!

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
- Li Shu!
- Don't sleep!

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,880
Luckily, his internal organs are intact.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,440
Later, when the anesthesia wears off,
he will wake up.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,480
These days, I will come regularly

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,440
to treat the wound.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Thank you, doctor.

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

40
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,800
If there's anything, let me know.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Thank you.

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,080
I'll check if Auntie is awake.

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,160
You'd take Weiwei to go later.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
Or, if Auntie wakes up,

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,600
there will be new trouble!

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,760
I won't leave.

47
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
I stay here till he wakes up!

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
Tang, Li Shu's mother, is insane now!

49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm worried she'll hurt you!

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
No!

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,080
I won't leave!

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,240
We can't let what happened today go!

53
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
We must call the police!

54
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Wan'er!

55
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
After all, she is Li Shu's mother.

56
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Is she part of Shiyu's death?

57
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Why put all the blame

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
on Tang alone?

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
For the past few years,

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,960
his mother's life should be tough, right?

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,840
Have you forgotten that

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,160
his mother insisted on
breaking you two apart back then?

63
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,200
Wan'er, stop talking!

64
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
I have to speak it out!

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
If she hadn't got someone to pursue

66
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,600
Tang Weiwei, taking misleading photos,

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
would Zeng Shiyu have died?

68
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,440
If she hadn't locked Zeng Shiyu,

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,680
would Li Shu feel guilty for a lifetime

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
for letting his brother out?

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Anyway, it's all her fault!

72
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,600
What does this have to do with Tang?

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,320
Auntie, when did you wake up?

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,320
Shu.

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,240
It's my fault!

76
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,280
It turns out I was wrong.

77
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Mom!

78
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Shu!

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,080
I remember everything now.

80
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm sorry!

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,040
Shu!

82
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,920
Shu!

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Mom!

84
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,880
It's good that you're okay!

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
Mom!

86
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Weiwei.

87
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,520
Have a good rest.

88
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll go back now.

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,640
Why are you pulling me?

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
Why won't you let me finish?

91
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
Do you think it's not chaotic enough?

92
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,960
His mother's still kept in the dark!

93
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
That's why his mother has been in a daze.

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
What if something happens?

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
Can you take responsibility for it?

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
I...

97
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
Have you considered the consequences?

98
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,390
Wan'er.

99
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,940
Let's go!

100
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,080
How are Li Shu and Auntie doing?

101
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,720
You'd stay here to

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
take good care of them.

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,440
I'll go with you.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,280
Our boss's life isn't romantic, isn't it?

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
It feels like it's not just his life,

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
his career is also full of obstacles!

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,680
What are you talking about?

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
Come on! Spit...

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Spit...

110
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,000
Everyone is here!

111
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
Good news!

112
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,520
Qing Yu was involved in plagiarism issues.

113
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
So, Geng Di has already

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
canceled the contract with Qing Yu,

115
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
and has already reached me, wanting

116
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,120
to follow up on the agreement.

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
Then, we must be ruthless on the price!

118
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
Otherwise,

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
we won't be able to let it go!

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Don't worry. It's up to me!

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
But Tang,

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
you must pull yourself together!

123
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,600
Isn't it just a man?

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
At worst, I'll break up with Jiang Wen,

125
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,680
being single with you!

126
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,980
You better not!

127
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
I fear with the help of Jiang's hints,

128
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,120
our studio will be wiped out right now!

129
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,400
How many nutrient-less

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
short videos have you watched?

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Not as many as you have.

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,800
Stop nonsense!

133
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,120
Go back to our business!

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,200
Does Geng Di have any new requests today?

135
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Still the same as always.

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,680
They want Jiang Mi to be the spokesperson.

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,320
I have to go over the contract with him?

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
Yes!

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
So, you can't break up with him!

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,800
Think of the bigger picture!

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Just consider it for the sake of us!

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
It's so infuriating!

143
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
