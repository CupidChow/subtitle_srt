No, I didn't do that!

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
You asked me to do so yesterday.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,640
I asked you to do so?

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,960
I ordered you to do it?

I, I...

27

Have I asked you to take me back?

You insisted on coming back with me!

I, you...

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,120
Even tricked me into posting on Moments!

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,080
You posted it yourself!

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,480
Why would I post it?

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,880
You're quite thoughtful!

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,680
You even changed my clothes!

That Tang Weiwei.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
She wouldn't suffer a loss!

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
No problem.

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,030
Think about it.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
She reviewed the contract herself.

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,840
She also handled the goods.

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,320
How could we possibly know these are

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,040
water-stained defective products?

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
You are the intern, right?

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
I've listened to Mr. Zhang's recordings.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
What do you want?

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,920
I want you and Xu Jing

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,560
to apologize to Tang Weiwei!

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
I can give you a large sum of money.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,240
You must apologize to Tang Weiwei!

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,960
You don't want the money?

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,120
I got confused that at such an age,

52
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,980
what did you want from her?

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,080
At your age...

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,640
Right? Completely...

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
- Stop it!
- Let go! Hurt!

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
Apologize to her!

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,080
I can get you, and think about it.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,360
So, as you said, I...

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,920
- Go now!
- If apologizing...

60
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Alright.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
I'll go right now!

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,920
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
(What's going on?)

64
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
(I don't know!)

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,960
Director Tang,

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm really sorry!

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,520
Previously, I got insane.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
I hope you can forgive us.

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
Okay.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,560
How about

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,240
going out now, you guys?

72
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,400
I hope you can forgive us.

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,480
Surprisingly, Li Shu is quite reliable!

74
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,840
How could they be together?

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,040
Li Shu must play his part!

76
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,460
He wanted to break up with me.

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,060
And I don't even know the reason!

78
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,900
Then let's find him to make it clear.

79
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,300
He definitely has feelings for you!

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,540
He doesn't reply to me!

81
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,340
I can't reach him at all!

82
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,300
Hold on!

83
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,260
(Three)

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,620
Let's go. I'll take you to find him.

85
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,460
Shu, stop drinking!

86
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,300
Shu, don't!

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,540
I told you to stop drinking!

88
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,820
Have another drink!

89
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,700
Negative!

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Brother Wen,

91
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,540
do you think it's funny?

92
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,300
Turns out she never betrayed my brother!

93
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,420
She is so nice,

94
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,700
but I've never trusted her!

95
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,860
And I've been lying to her all along!

96
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,900
Li Shu.

97
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,060
Shunning won't solve the problem!

98
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,820
You should go and explain it to her.

99
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm too ashamed to see her!

100
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,620
I am not worthy of her.

101
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,860
(They should be arriving soon, right?)

102
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,060
Here it is!

103
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,660
Where is he?

104
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,780
Bathroom.

105
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,220
I'll go find him.

106
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,700
I'll go, too.

107
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,980
You better not go and mess it up.

108
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,020
Come with me.

111
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,230
You asked Zhang Ruichao and Xu Jing

112
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,140
to apologize to me?

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,780

I want you to know that

155
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,460
we've already been a couple.

But for some things, you know

160
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,860
I can't explain it to you.

I want to drag

Tang Weiwei down with me!

181
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,540
It's not easy for them to be together.

182

184
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm the one who's heartbroken now.

185
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,940
You're still speaking for Tang Weiwei!

186
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,020
Did you guys know each other long ago?

187
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,940
Anyway,

188
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,660
Li Shu is not your special someone.

189
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,100
I'll bring someone nicer to you.

190
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,860
I don't want anyone else!

191
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,820
I just love Li Shu!

192
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,220
Just leaving?

193
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,460
Is it all over?

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,180
What are you doing?

195
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,180
Having some fruit.

196
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,500
Okay.

197
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,460
But you need to keep away from me.

198
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,940
I'm busy handing over affairs.

199
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,540
Annoying!

200
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,100
Hand over?

201
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,130
But,

202
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,980
hasn't everything been resolved?

203
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,180
Are you still going to resign?

204
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,260
Although it's mostly resolved,

205
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,420
I want to create my brand,

206
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,620
also a national brand, which is

207
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,420
fully domestically produced.

208
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,580
That's great!

209
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,260
Then I can help you with it.

210
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,620
Alright.

211
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,820
But not today, alas.

212
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,580
Auntie is coming over later.

213
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,240
When will you

214
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,900
get along so well with Ms. Cai?

215
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,980
It's a secret.

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,620
Anyway, we get along with each other.

217
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,300
I told you that I want to be

218
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,020
a good supportive partner for you!

219
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,220
So well-behaved, huh?

220
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,140
