=Episode 20=
Just confess!

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,000
Listen up.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,600
I just went out for a while,

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,680
and you dared to let him in!

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
Are you insane?

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,720
I guess you've done so

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,760
for many times, right?

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,960
It's I came here

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,480
to get Weiwei.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
- Don't blame her.
- Shut up!

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,920
You're talking nonsense!

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,100
You have the nerve to call her Weiwei!

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,240
Your turn!

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,080
Speak it out!

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,320
Don't you need investments?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,320
- Maybe I could.
- Negative!

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
I really can.

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,080
I really can do it.

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,120
Tang.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm back.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,760
Feeling pretty good!

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Getting ready to go live?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
Well...

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,600
Learned from a big name, then coming back?

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm gifted.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,040
So, it's just a matter of time!

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
Look!

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,320
I've met a few people these days.

46
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,470
They're in big channel network companies

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
and from platforms that get many views.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,040
I'll capitalize on them if I have to.

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,200
My goal is to have fans
exceed one million by next month.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,600
Do you think

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,920
if we go live with

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,520
more daily commutes and

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,280
tutorials on new Chinese-style outfits,

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,840
would that work better?

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,960
I think it's workable.

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
Really?

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,240
We already have a certain number of fans.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
And items related to OOTD, which

59
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,800
will enjoy extensive popularity.

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,720
In our current fan group, most of them

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,640
are young professionals from the 2000s

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,940
and students. So daily commuting

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
will be a necessity for them.

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,760
New national-style outfits

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
are a trend.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
I just knew it.

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
You understand me.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,480
Who is this Ye Chengcheng?

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
He has added me several times.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You recommended him.

71
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
I don't know!

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Ask him after accepting.

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,560
Take your seat.

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Well...

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Sister, I'd like to introduce myself.

76
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
I'm one of your fans.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
My name is Ye Chengcheng.

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Hello!

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,080
My name is Tang Weiwei.

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,600
This is my partner,

81
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Qu Wan'er.

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Well...

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,160
Are you an adult?

84
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
I am already twenty.

85
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,040
A junior at the Central Fashion University.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
Also majoring in fashion design.

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,720
It's as if you're mini Li Shu. Why?

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,480
Sister.

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
I think

90
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,880
you're prettier than that in the video.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
I came to meet you, not to

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
hear your compliments.

93
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Leave our business alone once meeting you.

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Well...

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
I want to join your team.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,120
I'll be in charge of

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
production and sales.

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,260
You're responsible for the design.

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
And you're in charge of production.

100
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
From sewing to quality inspection,

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
from tags to wash labels,

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,480
from shipping to packaging,

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
do you know how many workers are needed?

104
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,960
What is the labor cost for these workers?

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,040
What's the cost of
the simplest plain white T-shirt?

106
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,560
Do you know all of this?

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
I...

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Young guys do great deeds. That's great!

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,320
But if you haven't been on it,

110
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
just relying on passion,

111
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
you can achieve nothing!

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
My family owns a factory.

113
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,760
What?

114
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
My family has a factory.

115
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,520
We do OEM for foreign trade.

116
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
Although I have no idea about it,

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,080
my uncle and aunt are veterans.

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,520
Sister,

119
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,640
I really like sort of clothes from you!

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
I'm willing to do the best of my capacity

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,140
to make the garments as you request.

122
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,360
As for sales

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,200
and

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
profit sharing,

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
we can bring them to the table.

126
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,920
What are you waiting for?

127
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Come on, say yes!

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
Let me think about it.

129
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
So these days,

130
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,480
can you take me as your apprentice?

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,320
I... I really like you!

132
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,240
Now, young guys

133
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
are pretty brave!

134
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,280
I... I mean

135
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,080
I really like the clothes you design!

136
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,780
No salary, available 24/7!

137
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,400
And all the odd jobs are left to you.

138
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
Can you accept that?

139
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,360
No problem!

140
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
Welcome to join us!

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,710
We are short of staff now.

142
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,320
We have no money to hire interns.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Alright.

144
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Send you the address on WeChat later.

145
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
- Okay.
- Just tomorrow.

146
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Well...

147
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,520
I have one thing that you can let

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
Jiang Mi be the face of our future?

149
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,640
Review and remember all of these,

150
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
plus the differences between them.

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
- You take a look.
- Okay.

152
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Thank you, sister.

153
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,320
This one...

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,840
About the ingredients...

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
Each of them is labeled.

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
Did you see it? There are differences.

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,200
Tian Song is imported Tencel.

158
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,000
And there's a domestic one called Moni.

159
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,040
Sister, I'm going to open the door.

160
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,240
Hello, are you...

161
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm the delivery person.

162
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Give it to me.

163
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,120
It smells so good!

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,760
It turns out you're Weiwei's friend!

165
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
So,

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
how could a delivery person

167
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
dress like this?

168
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,600
Chengcheng, come over and eat together!

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
Alright!

170
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,920
Eat while it's hot.

171
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
Come on.

172
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,600
I made this for you.

173
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,120
It's okay.

174
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,110
Have some together!

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,960
Take it.

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Thank you, sister.

177
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
- Here it is!
- I'm hungry, too.

178
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Can you tell Tian Song from Moni?

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
- I'll try.
- Try it!

180
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
This is Tian Song.

181
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,960
This is Moni.

182
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,760
You got it fast!

183
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
In our factory,

184
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,880
Moni is commonly used now.

185
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,280
It's not only cheaper than Tian Song,

186
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
but also less likely to shrink.

187
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
It's easy to clean.

188
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,280
Yes, and it's for next season's fabric.

189
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
And it's very suitable for winter.

190
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
Right, there's also Xinjiang cotton.

191
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,160
- Also, for winter.
- Can we eat first?

192
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,720
Sure, let's eat first.

193
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
Come on, Chengcheng.

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,560
Have more.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
Thank you, sister.

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,000
You have more, too.

197
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay.

198
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,880
Brother Wen,

199
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,400
you never changed.

200
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,240
I heard that you've been

201
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
going to Weiwei's place these days.

202
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Yes.

203
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,720
I also heard she got a new apprentice

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
with a good looking.

205
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,360
Brother Wen,

206
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,960
why did you speak of these things?

207
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,240
What you've got in the cup?

208
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Orange juice!

209
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
Orange juice?

210
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,400
Oh, gosh!

211
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,880
You just have orange juice!

212
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
The likes of you won't understand.

213
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
I'll go pick up my girlfriend later.

214
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
And you,

215
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,960
you better go home early.

216
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
Alright!

217
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
By the way,

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
Xu Jing from Qing Yu is now a director.

219
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
In the old days,

220
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,880
those few old-timers who followed Weiwei

221
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,040
were all fired by her.

222
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
These days, Tang Weiwei

223
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,400
really want to hire people, right?

224
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
This is as much as I can help you.

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
Alright.

226
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
Goodbye.

227
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Sister Amy.

228
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,160
Can you spare time to meet?

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
When was it changed?

230
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
Hello, Mr. Li.

231
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,200
Have you found the venue?

232
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,480
I got it.

233
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,520
Okay.

234
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,080
Look, who came here?

235
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
- Amy Linda!
- Vivian!

236
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Why are you here?

237
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
This Xu Jing is really too much!

238
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
I dragged you into this situation.

239
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,280
It's not your fault.

240
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,080
Now, Qing Yu is in a mess.

241
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,520
Even if she wants us to stay,

242
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
we've planned to leave for a long time.

243
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Director.

244
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,360
Can we join you to start over again?

245
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Yes, Director!

246
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
We want to continue working with you!

247
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,520
Look!

248
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Now,

249
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,920
I don't even have a regular studio!

250
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,120
We don't need to be paid back at first.

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
And we're not afraid of hardship.

252
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes, Director.

253
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,000
We can join you. That's ok!

254
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,200
Weiwei.

255
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,080
I have a plan. Do you want to hear it?

256
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,320
Come over here with me.

257
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
You can think about it.

258
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,280
No need to be confused.

259
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
All the contract terms and conditions

260
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,360
will be prescribed.

261
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
And, after

262
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,200
Wan'er and Ye Chengcheng coming back,

263
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,800
we can discuss it together.

264
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,880
Alright.

265
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,360
But,

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,200
no need to have Ye Chengcheng in, right?

267
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
He's still a student.

268
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,480
He knows nothing!

269
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,320
You're not much older than him, either.

270
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,120
Fine!

271
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,800
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

272
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,120
Take you to a nice place!

273
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,600
Where'll we up to?

274
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,920
You'll know once you get there!

275
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,960
Li Shu knows how to seize every chance!

276
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
Have you decided to accept his investment?

277
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,040
Still haven't made up my mind.

278
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
Actually, you've already forgiven him,

279
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,600
right?

280
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,680
As your best friend,

281
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,800
I listen to you.

282
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,480
Just have your second thoughts on it.

283
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,440
I'm leaving.

284
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,920
I'll give you a chance to explain.

285
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Three...

286
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,480
Three years ago...

287
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,280
Go back and have some rest.

288
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,680
Okay.

289
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Go to bed early.

290
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,040
Good night.

291
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,040
How about the surroundings?

292
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
I put a lot of thought into it

293
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,680
to find this place.

294
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,920
Do you think it's ok for your studio?

295
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,560
How did you know I'm on it?

296
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Of course, I know!

297
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,160
You definitely wouldn't

298
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,360
ignore Amy and Linda.

299
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,520
But now, our brand needs to be promoted.

300
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,240
It reaches the limit of having many guys.

301
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,760
You need a bigger venue.

302
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,360
Look at this place!

303
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,560
Downstairs is an internet-famous café.

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,720
Put ready-made clothes on both sides.

305
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,000
This area can be laid out, including

306
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,800
these empty spaces on the walls.

307
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,680
You can hang brand promotional posters

308
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,640
and catalogs upon it.

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, after buying coffee,

310
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,200
the customers downstairs...

311
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,640
- Li Shu.
- wander here...

312
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
Thank you.

313
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
It's my pleasure.

314
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,520
If you feel it's nice,

315
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,160
come to sign the contract this afternoon.

316
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,400
Just relax.

317
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,880
I haven't rented it in advance.

318
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Because I know

319
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
you don't want me to do that.

320
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,920
Let's have some talks.

321
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
Alright.

322
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,680
Talk about what?

323
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
Talk about investments.

324
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,880
