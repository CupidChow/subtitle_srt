=Episode 17=
What a surprise!

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,240
Li's so good at cooking!

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,480
Our Weieei, well...

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,680
She's really gotten a great deal!

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
Auntie, you're kidding!

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,280
Weiwei did me a great favor!

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,040
She, huh

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
would never do that!

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,420
How many pieces of meat do you want?

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Depends on how many you give me.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
When will you get your certificate?

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,720
Mom!

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
We just started dating!

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,240
Look at you, kid.

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
Li is still young!

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,320
But you're already twenty-eight!

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,280
If you round it,

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,800
you're practically thirty!

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,680
Y'd be considered an older mother!

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
This issue

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
cannot be ignored.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,760
- Here it is.
- We feel ok now.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,280
No plans to get married.

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,640
Since things are going well now,

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,800
marriage is a must for you!

45
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,560
Getting married a bit earlier,

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
that isn't a bad idea, right?

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Li,

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,360
am I right?

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,180
You said it!

50
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,260
I think you're right!

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
Li,

52
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
what does your family do?

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Do your parents know about this?

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
What about your family?

55
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Auntie, I have only my mother.

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,040
When my father passed away,

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
he left some inheritance.

58
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,920
We're considered a middle-class family.

59
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
How about this?

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,960
I'd ask your mom out someday.

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
So our parents can meet

62
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,760
and have a meal together.

63
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,440
Sure!

64
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Okay.

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
But my mom hasn't been feeling well.

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,760
She's been recuperating.

67
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
It might take...

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
What's wrong?

69
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
It's nothing.

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Let's go.

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
(Weiwei)

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
(If you knew who I am,)

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,000
(would you be willing to marry me?)

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,240
I told your brother that

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,920
someone the likes of her is getting

76
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,600
close to your brother for money.

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,360
What's wrong?

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Had a nightmare?

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
It's nothing.

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Weiwei,

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll go home tomorrow.

82
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
Alright.

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
Shu!

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
For the past few years,

85
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
I've always been a burden to you!

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,480
Don't say it like this!

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
You're my mom, and I'm your son!

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,160
These days, I

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
have gotten a lot better.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,640
You're not that young anymore.

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Do you have a girl you love?

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
You can bring her home.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm afraid the one I got, whom

94
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,520
you'll hate!

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
How could it be?

96
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,320
As long as you fall in love with her,

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,840
I'll be happy.

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Really?

99
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
It's getting late.

100
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Your brother should be back soon.

101
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Mom.

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,800
Shiyu.

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
Shiyu, you're back.

104
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,680
Mom, it's me.

105
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
I remembered that

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,120
your brother will never come back.

107
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,080
Mom!

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Everything is alright now.

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,120
It's okay now.

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,200
I will always be with you.

111
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
I'll always stay with you.

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,160
Li, fixed an appointment with Zhou.

113
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,740
(Jiang Mi)

114
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm waiting at the café for you.

115
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,560
Come alone.

116
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
Miss Jiang.

117
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
I'm currently on vacation.

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,600
If you're talking about business...

119
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,840
It's something personal.

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
If you're talking about Li Shu's matter,

121
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,240
- then I am...
- About Shiyu.

122
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
I know

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,080
you're Shiyu's ex-girlfriend.

124
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,760
You're Jiang Wen's sister.

125
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
These things are no strangers to me.

126
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
It seems

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
there's still something you don't know.

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,640
What do I need to know?

129
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
Li Shu is Shiyu's biological brother.

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,720
He can't let his brother's death go.

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,600
I wonder why Li Shu is doing this.

132
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
But I hope you can leave him.

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080

174
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,600
It's a big day today, right?

175
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
You presented me with a lavish dinner

176
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,640
and flowers, too!

177
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
It's a big day for the two of us.

- Weiwei.
- It is quite important.

179
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,600
I knew everything.

180
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
When did you know?

181
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
You are Shiyu's younger brother, right?

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,560
You thought I killed him, right?

183
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,240
So you schemed to get close to me,

184
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
gaining my trust step by step,

185
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,580
finally making me fall in love with you,

186
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
then crazily taking revenge on me?

187
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,200
It was all to avenge Shiyu, right?

188
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Weiwei,

189
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
at first, I...

190
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
I did deliberately get close to you.
