19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,840
Hello, how are you?

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,580
Yes, I am.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,860
Good.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,540
Can you help me with this report?

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,060
Li Shu.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,380
Just take your seat here.

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,150
Never mind, and I'd stay where I am.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,000
The sunshine here is nice.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,540
Yes.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,620
Alright, then, I'll take another look.

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,630
Thank you.

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,500
Linda.

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,300
Can you buy me some coffee?

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,980
Today, I'm treating everyone to coffee.

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,900
Great.

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,020
Michelle is new here.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,460
How can we let you treat us?

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,220
I've ordered coffee for everyone.

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,620
Li Shu.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,940
Can you get them to everyone here?

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,980
Alright, Director.

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,420
Vivian is really nice.

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,860
Stop flattering.

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,220
Li Shu.

44
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,820
Keep it up.

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,820
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,100
Li Shu.

47
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,180
How do you feel

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,260
working in my department?

49
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,740
It's my plan.

50
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,020
Take a look.

51
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,540
Not bad.

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,860
Can I return to Division One?

53
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,420
What's wrong?

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,980
Isn't that Xu Jing quite nice to you?

55
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,780
No.

56
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,500
I just didn't expect it

57
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,620
as for male interns now,

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,620
they also experience office harassment.

59
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,580
Then, why don't you help me?

60
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,300
I can't help.

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,460
You didn't help me.

62
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,020
I'm not that capable of helping.

63
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,500
You didn't help me at all!

64
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,340
I... I can't help!

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,300
Why didn't you help?

66
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,380
- I...
- You didn't help!

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,500
- No!
- You hated to help!

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,380
You just didn't help me.

69
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,780
I must punish you!

70
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,580
Help!

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,620
Li Shu.

72
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,940
Enough.

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,460
Why did you reject his application?

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,900
Li Shu is now in Division 2.

75
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,340
About when he will be regularized,

76
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,860
whether he can be regularized,

77
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,740
and why he can't be regularized,

78
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,860
Division 1 won't butt in, right?

79
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
Alright.

80
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,820
(CV, Xu Jing)

81
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,540
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,570
Vivian.

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,700
Come to the meeting room.

84
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,740
Vivian.

85
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,180
How do you manage people?

86
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
That Li Shu person,

87
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
he always disobeyed his supervisor,

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,560
and never listened to advice.

89
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,850
With this kind of performance,

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,420
do you still want him to be promoted?

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,500
Mr. Zhang.

92
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,100
From the initial plagiarism

93
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,980
to Jiang Mi becoming the ambassador,

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,340
and then later on,

95
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,480
collaborating with Geng Di

96
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,060
to solve the fabric issue with Tian Song,

97
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,100
all his efforts are evident to everyone.

98
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,820
How come

99
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,540
it has become passive slack?

100
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,900
One thing is one thing.

101
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,580
It's what he's supposed to do.

102
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,740
There's nothing to argue about.

103
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,980
But within our company, shouldn't

104
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,940
a harmonious environment be built?

105
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,860
You guys are arguing all day long.

106
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,380
Isn't this a slap in my face?

107
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,260
Part Two came to complain so quickly.

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,300
It's not called complaining and

109
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,700
it's called reporting the situation.

110
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,100
This time, I've decided that

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,260
I will conduct

112
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,700
a department-wide criticism.

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,100
If this happens again next time,

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,420
it won't be that simple to handle.

115
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,980
You should also pay attention.

116
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,020
A public criticism?

117
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,980
What the heck?

118
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,500
What exactly is Zhang Ruichao doing?

119
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,380
Obviously, trying to protect Xu Jing?!

120
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,300
What do you think about it?

121
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,500
If you were not here, the whole company

122
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,620
would be losing money.

123
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,140
Now, they've come up with something that

124
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Xu Jing takes things for nothing.

125
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,260
Why do you look angrier than I do?

126
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,220
I'm standing up for you!

127
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,340
You work tirelessly for the company.

128
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
The company treats you like a donkey!

129
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,620
What kind of person is Xu Jing?!

130
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,780
I have read her CV.

131
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,260
It's not even considered a diploma mill!

132
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,540
Let's see her in the future.

133
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,980
How will she mess it up?

134
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,100
Don't ruin the fruit!

135
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
You say...

136
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,900
I want to go out on my own,

137
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,500
and create a personal brand,

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,940
what do you think?

139
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,540
Are you serious?

140
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,060
Actually, I've been thinking about it.

141
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,180
Someone's knocking; go check it out!

142
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,180
Mr. Jiang.

143
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,540
Why are you here?

144
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,420
Li Shu said you ate together.

145
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
I'm hungry, too.

146
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,020
You don't mind, do you?

147
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,380
Never mind.

148
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,580
Please come in.

149
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,220
Mr. Jiang, long time no see.

150
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,660
Indeed!

151
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
Long time no see!

152
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,180
Dinner is ready!

153
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,180
- Dinner is ready.
- Come.

154
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,080
We're having crab today!

155
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,620
Come, have a seat. You've worked hard.

156
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,380
Which one do you think has the most roe?

157
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,020
- This one.
- This one.

158
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,780
I'll peel it for you.

159
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,740
There really is quite a lot!

160
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,580
Try this.

161
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,820
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

162
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,260
Are you hiding something from me?

163
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,900
(It's a long story)

164
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,140
I'm leaving now.

165
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,940
Stop!

166
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,660
Do you have any other instructions?

167
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,420
If I hadn't come to find you today,

168
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,220
were you not planning to talk to me?

169
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
Ignoring you

170
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,020
means rejecting you.

171
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,260
I want to have nothing with you.

172
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,100
But that day at the hotel,

173
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,420
you didn't say that.

174
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,700
I got drunk.

175
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,620
So, I wasn't serious, right?

176
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,500
Just consider me a bad woman.

177
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,420
Can you stop contacting me

178
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,380
and following me?

179
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,420
Well...

180
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,140
Brother!

181
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,420
Brother!

182
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,460
Why are you drinking alone at home?

183
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,540
By the way,

184
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,700
when will you go for shooting?

185
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,460
You realize you need to take care of me!

186
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,980
About next week.

187
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,100
Take two days when you're free.

188
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Next week?

189
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,980
Alright.

190
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,500
Why is it so strange?

191
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,900
Do you have something going on?

192
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,900
Do I?

193
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,420
Do you have something going on?

194
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,980
Quickly tell me what's going on.

195
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,860
Nothing.

196
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
I don't believe it.

197
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,460
How's the strength?

198
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,860
Not bad, right?

199
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,260
For this technician,

200
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,340
you're so impressive!

201
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,540
Help me extend the session later.

202
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,380
Got it.

203
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,780
So do you want it to be serious or...

204
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,660
Stop nonsense and press properly.

205
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
Hurry up!

206
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,660
- Press here.
- Okay.

207
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,140
But to be honest,

208
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,380
where did you learn this technique?

209
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,520
It's really quite professional.

210
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,900
I used to massage my mom often.

211
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,300
Your mom?

212
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,860
What kind of person is she?

213
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,700
You've never told me about

214
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,980
your mom.

215
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,140
In the past,

216
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,460
she was very strong-willed.

217
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,620
But later,

218
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,900
she fell seriously ill,

219
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,060
and became somewhat frail.

220
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,140
It's okay.

221
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,220
She will get better.

222
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
How about this,

223
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,460
if there's time later,

224
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,540
I'll go back with you to see Auntie.

225
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,900
Okay.

226
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,620
At some moment.

227
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,380
By the way, how come

228
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,220
you're so familiar with Jiang Wen?

229
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,020
He's a friend of my brother.

230
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,620
Come.

231
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Let me massage your back again.

232
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,900
(What a coincidence)

233
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,510
Confess, and you'll be treated leniently.

234
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,240
Resist, and you'll be treated harshly.

235
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,420
There's no relationship at all!

236
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,740
There won't be any relationship.

237
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,140
Nonsense!

238
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,860
Last night, Jiang Wen's eyes

239
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,980
were almost glued to you!

240
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,860
Do you think I'm blind?

241
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,380
I won't listen!

242
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,780
Just take care of yourself and Li Shu.

243
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,780
Why do you butt in my affairs?

244
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,860
Speaking of which, these days,

245
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,020
do you still think of Zeng Shiyu?

246
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,580
Actually,

247
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,100
ever since Li Shu appeared,

248
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,700
I yearn Shiyu

249
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,340
less and less.

250
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,740
Especially after returning from Guangzhou,

251
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,180
Shiyu has been lost in my dreams again.

252
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,020
(Turns out I'm just an alternative.)

253
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,500
