1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,790
Shirasaki, it's starting.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,670
Okay.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,380
Here you go, Asami-san.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,710
Thanks.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,830
So, today's "Daytime Dream"...

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,000
is the spin-off starring
Sakuma-san and Yamase-san, right?

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,380
Yeah.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,670
We hardly filmed with them at all.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,750
I'm excited to see what they've done.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,250
Me too.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,130
It's starting.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,880
After quitting his job for personal reasons, Ryoji...

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,920
found himself at a café,

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,250
where he had a fateful encounter
with the owner, Takumi.

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,290
Drawn to each other,

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,960
they found themselves in a love triangle
with Takumi's childhood friend, Yamato.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,330
After a series of misunderstandings and heartaches,

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,130
the two finally found their way to each other.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm Teppei, Ryoji's best friend and ex-coworker.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,170
I don't have much to do
with their love story.

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,250
I'm just the nice-guy supporting character.

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,630
Delivery!

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,330
Oh, that's for me.

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,040
Thanks for waiting.

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,630
- Yamato...
- The food from this place is great, isn't it?

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,170
Tell me about it.

27
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,960
Here you go.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,170
Yamato.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,380
Teppei?

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,420
Wait, you work here?

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,330
Yeah, small world.

32
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,500
Yeah, it's been a while.

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,960
You could at least text back, you know.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,580
I get way too much spam.

35
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,080
So you're doing deliveries now.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,460
I just started recently.

37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,330
I totally underestimated Tokyo summers, though.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,670
Doing deliveries this time of year must be brutal.

39
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,790
Oh, right.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,080
Here.

41
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,880
Hey...

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,960
Thanks.

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,210
Hang on a sec.

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,790
Here.

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,710
Here, take this.

46
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,170
You look exhausted.

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,580
Office work is no walk in the park either.

48
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,500
Have something sweet. It'll give you a boost.

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,500
And this is the love story
that happened to a guy like me.

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,170
"25:00, in Akasaka Season 2 Daytime Dream Another Side"

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,830
(One Month Later)

52
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,960
Excuse me.

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,790
Oh, hey, Yamato.

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,250
Funaki-san, thanks for your hard work.

55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,710
You too, Miyamori-san.

56
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,460
You've worked hard.

57
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,330
Teppei is waiting for you.

58
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,500
Delivery's here!

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,250
The smell of this kebab is bringing me back to life.

60
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,960
I'm digging in.

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,460
This is so good.

62
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,130
What about you? Which sauce did you pick?

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,380
I got the garlic yogurt sauce.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,580
Garlic... yogurt sauce?

65
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,210
Yep.

66
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,880
What the heck? Is that even a thing?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yep.

68
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,130
It's amazing. Want a bite?

69
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,500
An indirect kiss...

70
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
Wow, this is good.

71
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,130
I never would've thought of this flavor...

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,580
I had no idea.

73
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,380
See? Hang out with me
and you'll discover new things.

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,880
I guess so.

75
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,330
By the way, why do you always eat lunch here?

76
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,290
Because it's nice and cool in here.

77
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,330
Besides, eating alone is no fun.

78
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,580
It's always better to eat with someone, right?

79
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,670
Yeah, you've got a point.

80
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,040
Oh, I heard that for their next trip, Takumi and Ryoji...

81
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,880
are going here.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,540
That's pretty fancy.

83
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,710
So, how are Ryoji and Takumi

84
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,460
doing these days?

85
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,420
No idea.

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,580
Actually, Takumi said something weird the other day.

87
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,080
He said, "When you truly fall for someone..."

88
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,710
"you'll know exactly where your heart is."

89
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,210
I have no idea what that's supposed to mean.

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,750
Your heart, huh...

91
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,790
What? It fell through?

92
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,830
The client had a last-minute change of heart.

93
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm so sorry.

94
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,210
But just yesterday, they said
we were good to go with this proposal.

95
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,670
I know.

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,460
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,420
Could you please draw up
a new proposal as soon as possible?

98
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,880
That's completely unreasonable.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,210
Everyone's worked so hard
on this proposal...

100
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,130
It's all right.

101
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,130
Understood.

102
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,250
We'll submit a new proposal by the end of the week.

103
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,000
Sorry about this.

104
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,460
I'll help out.

105
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,250
Miyamori-san, you've been putting in
a lot of overtime lately, haven't you?

106
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,880
You should head home for today.

107
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,460
Delivery.

108
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,380
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,460
Miyamori-san told me what happened.

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,420
Thought you could use this.

111
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,960
Thanks.

112
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,670
So, got a lot on your mind?

113
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,630
It's just so frustrating.

114
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,420
It's okay to vent once in a while, right?

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,460
Not that I can do much to help, but...

116
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,500
It's just...

117
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,330
I'm always trying so hard, being nice to everyone,

118
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,460
shouldering all the pressure by myself.

119
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,790
Honestly, it gets exhausting sometimes.

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,420
Yeah.

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,960
I'm always considerate of others and the mood,

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,290
always holding back, playing the supportive one.

123
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,630
Am I just going to be the supporting character my whole life?

124
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,080
The guy who does all the work
behind the scenes?

125
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,420
It's nothing.

126
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,420
Sorry for dumping all this on you.

127
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,380
Well then, when you're with me,

128
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,790
you can just do whatever you want.
Be yourself.

129
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,420
If you have at least one person you can be like that with,

130
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,750
it should make things a little easier, don't you think?

131
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,920
Hey, what's with that look?

132
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,710
It's... nothing.

133
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,290
Nothing.

134
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,960
A trip... I'm really looking forward to it.

135
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,580
A camping trip.

136
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,380
What is this?

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,250
Why do we have to go
on a trip with those two?

138
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,580
It's going to be so awkward, isn't it?

139
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to...

140
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,170
make my move.

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Huh?

142
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,040
Nothing. Forget I said anything.

143
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm heading out.

144
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:29,040
I totally forgot. That guy is in love with Takumi.

145
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,210
He's going to make another move on Takumi.

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,250
Oh? You're not getting delivery from Yamato today?

147
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,830
Oh...

148
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,500
Yeah, it's... not a good day for it.

149
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,500
Teppei has been eating alone
every day lately.

150
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,630
I wonder what's going on with him.

151
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,710
Hey.

152
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,250
Huh?

153
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,080
What are you doing here?

154
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,170
Miyamori-san told me.

155
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,880
How come you haven't been ordering from me?

156
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,920
Oh, it's not that.

157
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,080
I've just been grabbing stuff from the convenience store.

158
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,670
It's quick and easy.

159
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,960
Sorry. I'll order from you next time.

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,790
Didn't I tell you?
You don't have to force a smile around me.

161
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,960
I told you last time, didn't I?

162
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,880
When you're with me, you can just be yourself.

163
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,500
There's no way I can do that!

164
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,460
What?

165
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Whenever I'm with you, my heart aches.

166
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,790
What's with you? Are you in love or something?

167
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,710
Don't mess with me.

168
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,920
I've never seen you make that face before.

169
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,920
Are you okay?

170
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,580
You don't mean...

171
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,920
Not at the office.

172
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,250
Sorry, I was just kidding.

173
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,000
What do you mean, "kidding"?

174
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,710
Is that how you joke with people?

175
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,040
No, I just...

176
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,130
You should go.

177
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,790
Just go.

178
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,130
Please.

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,130
I can't face you right now.

180
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,000
I see.

181
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,960
I get it.

182
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:05,460
There's no way Yamato could ever like someone like me.

183
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,630
What was I thinking, getting my hopes up?

184
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,960
Delivery.

185
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
- It's hot today, isn't it?
- Yeah.

186
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,790
Here's your order.

187
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,500
Guess I can't go on the trip now.

188
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,750
So you're really not coming?

189
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,210
Sorry, I can't make it.

190
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,920
Morning.

191
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,750
Morning.

192
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,330
Aren't you off today?

193
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,830
Weren't you supposed to be on that trip?

194
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,460
I decided not to go.

195
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,000
Why not?

196
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,170
You were so looking forward to it.

197
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,040
I did something awful to Yamato.

198
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,460
I'd feel too awkward going.

199
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,790
I think he probably hates me now.

200
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,130
What?

201
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,960
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,130
There's no way he hates you.

203
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,080
That guy is totally into you, too.

204
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,670
Huh?

205
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,000
You like Yamato, too, don't you?

206
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,080
What's that supposed to mean?

207
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,750
Then that's all the more reason for you to go, right?

208
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,960
Well...

209
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,830
Teppei, you're so dense.

210
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,380
The only reason Yamato comes here every day
is because he likes you.

211
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,960
We'll take care of work today.

212
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,750
At least let us help you out this time.

213
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,420
But...

214
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,960
Teppei.

215
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,290
Miyamori-san and I...

216
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,580
we both want you two to be happy.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,170
It'd be a shame to miss out. Don't work too hard.

218
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,330
I...

219
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,630
I'm on my way.

220
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,460
Teppei?

221
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,250
I came to do what I wanted to do.

222
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,830
I want to have dinner with you.

223
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,420
You came straight here.

224
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,330
Everyone else is here, too.

225
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,880
Let's eat.

226
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,830
Yeah.

227
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,830
Here you go.

228
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,080
It's ready.

229
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,250
Thanks.

230
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,830
Let's have a toast.

231
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,210
Yeah.

232
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,880
Cheers.

233
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,750
Ryoji and Takumi seem a little awkward.

234
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,420
Are they okay?

235
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,920
Whether they're fighting or what,

236
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,920
those two will be fine.

237
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,170
Huh?

238
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,670
I thought you liked Takumi.

239
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,880
What? That's ancient history.

240
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,130
Then what was all that talk about "making your move"?

241
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,080
I just assumed that on this trip,

242
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,750
you were going to make a move on Takumi.

243
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,580
No way.

244
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,830
Um...

245
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,210
This is what I meant.

246
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:19,960
I wanted to confess in a romantic place.

247
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,580
You said...

248
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,670
that when I'm with you,
I can just be myself.

249
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,210
That made me so happy.

250
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,750
I've always wanted...

251
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,080
someone who would say that to me.

252
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,330
That day...

253
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,290
the day you delivered food to my office,

254
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,790
I...

255
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,250
I fell for you.

256
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,290
Me too.

257
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,040
When I'm with you,

258
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,580
it hurts, right here.

259
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,080
I know.

260
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,630
I like you.

261
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,710
I like you.

262
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,670
If you dare say you're kidding,
I'll kill you.

263
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,630
Did that get through to you?

264
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,330
Huh?

265
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,670
Should we eat?

266
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,880
Yeah.

267
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,670
I'm starving.

268
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,920
Huh?

269
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,630
- We had the same idea?
- Looks like it. What'd you bring?

270
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,630
Uh, sandwiches today.

271
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,460
Oh, nice.

272
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,920
All right, let's eat.

273
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,830
No one's in here.

274
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,130
Huh?

275
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,130
Shirasaki, are you crying?

276
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,630
It's just...

277
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,130
Sakuma-san's performance was incredible.

278
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,290
It really was.

279
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
It's Sakuma.

280
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,130
Huh?

281
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,380
Hey, I'm watching.

282
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,960
You are? Thanks.

283
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,420
Yamase and I are watching it live over here, too.

284
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,210
Sakuma-san.

285
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,080
You were amazing.

286
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,580
Oh, Shirasaki's there with you?

287
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,210
Thanks.

288
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,290
I was so happy to see
a drama starring Sakuma-san.

289
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,830
How did it feel, starring in the spin-off?

290
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,000
How do I put this...

291
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,250
It's the happiest I've ever been in my life.

292
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,460
See? That's why I said you were amazing.

293
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:14,630
People who have fun with their work
are the coolest.

294
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,960
It means a lot to hear you say that.

295
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,170
Hey, Yuki, what about me?

296
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,330
As for Yamase-san...

297
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,080
you were so-so.

298
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,580
Hey, Yuki!

299
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,670
Next time, the four of us have to do
"Daytime Dream" together again.

300
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,250
Yeah. It's a promise.

301
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,420
Until then, let's all give it our best.

302
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,330
Hayama, good luck in the UK.

303
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,250
Yeah.

304
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,290
I will.

305
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,920
I'll do my best, too.

306
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,290
Why don't you two come over here?

307
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,790
We can have a drink.

308
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,580
Well...

309
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,330
No.

310
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,170
Let's do it next time.

311
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,170
Okay, fine. I get it.

312
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,380
What gives? Just the two of us again?

313
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,580
Lame.

314
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,250
Sakuma, you got a problem with me?

315
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,960
Not at all.

316
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,880
When Hayama gets back from the UK,

317
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,170
we're all going out for drinks. You have to be there.

318
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,380
It's a deal.

319
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,920
Yeah.

320
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,130
Same place as always.
