1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,750
Hayama, I have a favor to ask.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,170
Regarding this audition...

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,960
I want you to drop out.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,460
("Last Note," directed by Imai Gen)

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,540
I'm sure you already know,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,330
Director Imai...
didn't his movie last year do really well?

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,460
This is his next film.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,210
The lead actor had to drop out due to a sudden illness.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,170
Dropped out...

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,710
Originally,

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,830
they were supposed to start filming in two months.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,250
So, they're looking for a new leading man.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,330
The director mentioned one actor in particular.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,540
He said, "If he's the one playing the part, I have no objections."

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,630
He wants you for the lead role.

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,380
However...

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,380
If filming starts in two months, your schedule...

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,710
Exactly.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,920
If you're chosen in the final audition
for "Rain and Confession"...

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,040
the film's shooting schedule

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,630
will completely overlap with the play.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,630
I...

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,710
I want to see the audition through to the end.

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a project I've always wanted to do.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,130
Akeno-san.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,960
Hayama, I think...

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,000
for your acting career...

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,250
this will be a major turning point.

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,170
If you star in this film,

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,500
your recognition and reputation as an actor

31
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,750
will rise to a whole new level.

32
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,000
I know.

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,290
I know you want to do "Rain and Confession".

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,170
And you've already made it to the final audition.

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,170
It's cruel of me to bring this up now,

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,710
but...

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,170
you absolutely cannot pass up this opportunity.

38
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,080
Hayama.

39
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,710
I believe what you should do right now

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,920
is take this movie role.

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,380
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 5)

42
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,580
(New message from Sakuma)

43
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,540
How's it going?

44
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,670
I just got off work. I'm in Akasaka now.

45
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,250
Hayama, are you free?

46
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,210
So, how have you been?

47
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,460
- How have I been about what?
- Oh, nothing.

48
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,960
Hayama, you made it to the final round too, right?

49
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,420
Yeah.

50
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,710
I made it to the end too.

51
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,290
We might get to be in the play together.

52
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,380
- Sakuma.
- Hm?

53
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,500
If the job you want to do

54
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,460
conflicts with the job you should do,

55
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,420
what would you choose?

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,750
You've been in this business a long time.

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,710
I'm sure you've faced that kind of situation before.

58
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,710
Huh?

59
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,500
What are you smiling about?

60
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,380
Oh, nothing. It's just... this is a rare sight.

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,080
What do you mean?

62
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,420
Hayama, you're actually coming to me for advice.

63
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,750
- Is that so strange?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,210
I know it's not right for me to say this
when you're so troubled,

65
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,290
but I'm honestly happy.

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,250
Just forget I asked.

67
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,080
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,580
Well...

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,330
About your question,

70
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,880
I've been there.

71
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,420
What did you do then?

72
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,960
Well... after talking it over with my agent,

73
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,210
I ended up choosing the job I was supposed to do.

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,250
- I see.
- Yeah.

75
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,880
After all, when it comes to your so-called "status"...

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,460
to some extent, until you're on solid ground,

77
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,000
it's best to take whatever work
comes your way, isn't it?

78
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,170
Besides, my agent was just trying to make me a star,

79
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,710
so they were looking out for my best interests.

80
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,210
Right.

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,210
That makes sense.

82
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,000
But you're different, Hayama.

83
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,920
Huh?

84
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,540
I mean, you're not like I was back then.

85
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,960
Where you are now,

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
I think you have the right to choose.

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,330
Because you, Hayama,

88
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,920
have already established yourself, haven't you?

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,920
That being the case,

90
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,130
the "selfishness" of sticking to the work you want to do...

91
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,920
Well... maybe "selfishness" isn't the right word.

92
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,670
How should I put it?

93
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,000
It's your will.

94
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,630
- My will?
- Yes, your will.

95
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,130
The will to follow through on what you want to do.

96
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,920
I think you're in a position to make that choice.

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,540
Choose the job you truly want.

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,790
(Expressing the novel's beauty through physical performance)

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,420
Are you going to get in my way too?

100
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,790
Asami-san.

101
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,710
I'm home.

102
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,130
Welcome home.

103
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,540
Shirasaki.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,670
If you're going to sleep, go to bed.

105
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,290
I'm sleeping with Asami-san.

106
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,130
That's great.

107
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,210
Looks like our "in-house separation" is over.

108
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,750
Oh, right.

109
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,750
That's right.

110
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,380
We're still separated.

111
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,670
That thing...

112
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,710
it's not over yet?

113
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,750
Nope. Still on.

114
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,750
I see.

115
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,920
Sorry.

116
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,960
I was half-asleep and forgot.

117
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,000
It's fine.

118
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,920
I was kind of hoping you'd stay half-asleep.

119
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,580
No need.

120
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,290
It's fine, I'm wide awake now.

121
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,170
I see.

122
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,330
Hmm?

123
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,670
Huh?

124
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,960
I heard that for this brand's
new spokesperson,

125
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,960
Shirasaki's name is on the list of candidates.

126
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,710
Oh, this?

127
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,670
It's a lipstick I got from a commercial shoot.

128
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,500
Do you want it?

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,380
No, thanks.

130
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,380
Huh?

131
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,210
I'll get it on my own.

132
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,130
I see.

133
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,380
Yes.

134
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,330
Besides, the colors that suit you and me are different, right?

135
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,130
That's not what I meant...

136
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,330
It's fine.

137
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,670
Good night, Asami-san.

138
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,080
("Last Note")
This has also been a long-term project for Director Imai.

139
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,170
And there's not much time before filming begins.

140
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,460
We know this is a difficult thing to ask.

141
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,580
However...

142
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,540
if we could have you in the leading role, Hayama-san,

143
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,210
I believe this will undoubtedly be a wonderful film.

144
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,250
Hayama-san.

145
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,710
Hayama-san, I have seen many of your works.

146
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,670
You have a glamorous aura,

147
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,790
but deep down,

148
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,000
there seems to be this undercurrent
of lingering sadness and loneliness.

149
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,170
If you were to portray
this protagonist, Hayama-san,

150
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,580
I know we can create a fantastic film.

151
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,380
We've revised the script
with you in mind, Hayama-san.

152
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,380
Hayama-san.

153
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,460
This film will absolutely be brilliant.

154
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,040
To make that happen,

155
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,790
we sincerely ask you to lend us your strength.

156
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,170
Excuse me.

157
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,130
Please give me some time to think.

158
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,630
Shirasaki.

159
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,920
Why are you apologizing?

161
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,210
About that commercial.

162
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,920
The cosmetics brand
that Hayama-san also endorses.

163
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,250
They've decided to go with another actor.

164
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm sorry, Shirasaki.

165
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,210
Why are you apologizing to me, Shinoda-san?

166
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,710
Because I'm not capable enough as your manager.

167
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,750
No, that's not it.

168
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,880
It was my fault.

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,880
I wasn't chosen.

170
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,130
I just wasn't good enough.

171
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,920
("Rain and Confession," "Last Note")

172
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,790
I really love a novel
called "Rain and Confession".

173
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,210
It makes me wonder...

174
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,580
how I would interpret that character.

175
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,710
I guess that makes us
true rivals now, doesn't it?

176
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,250
(Play: "Rain and Confession"
Final Audition)

177
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,960
Alright, if there is anything you feel you must say,

178
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,460
or any questions, please ask.

179
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,170
Um...

180
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,290
Well...

181
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,000
It's all right.

182
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,330
Go ahead.

183
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,670
This is the final audition.

184
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,830
Feel free to say whatever is on your mind.

185
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,040
I think...

186
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,670
I think I understand now.

187
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,920
Muroga's feelings.

188
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,130
Like... why he had to kill.

189
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,290
Why did he keep committing murder?

190
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,880
Even though he was tormented by guilt,

191
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,460
why couldn't he give up on connecting with people?

192
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,710
He longed to be chosen.

193
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,330
Muroga...

194
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,580
all this time,

195
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,290
has he just been hoping for someone to need him?

196
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,420
He just...

197
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,540
wanted to be chosen.

198
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,250
But that wish was never granted.

199
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,670
Muroga's heart...

200
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,080
must have slowly become twisted.

201
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,580
That's what I believe.

202
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,750
So that's how you see Muroga?

203
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,710
Yes.

204
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,750
I see. Thank you.

205
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,670
Thank you.

206
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,210
Excuse me.

207
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,250
I'm home.

208
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Asami-san, welcome home.

209
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
Thanks.

210
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,130
Shirasaki, welcome home to you too.

211
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,170
I gave it my all.

212
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I don't know if it was good enough,

213
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,170
but I did everything I possibly could.

214
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,380
What about you, Asami-san?

215
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,250
Asami-san?

216
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm sorry, Shirasaki.

217
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,880
I...

218
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,380
didn't go to the final audition today.

219
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,130
What?

220
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,250
I dropped out.

221
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,080
What do you mean, you dropped out?

222
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,500
Why?

223
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,540
I got a movie offer.

224
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,580
And the shooting schedule for that film...

225
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,040
was a direct conflict with the audition.

226
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,040
So you chose the movie?

227
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,130
Yeah.

228
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,750
Akeno-san.

229
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,540
I'll...

230
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,210
take the offer.

231
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,380
Are you sure?

232
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,460
Yes.

233
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,420
Understood.

234
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,830
Hayama...

235
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,710
Thank you.

236
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,380
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

237
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,290
But...

238
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,000
I didn't want to say anything
to distract you before your audition.

239
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,000
Asami-san...

240
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,710
Are you really okay with this?

241
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,750
The director... out of all the actors,

242
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,790
chose me.

243
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,630
If he wants me that badly,

244
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,580
and has such high hopes for me,

245
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
I want to live up to those expectations.

246
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,290
I completely understand
why people have such high hopes for you, Asami-san.

247
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,710
But are you sure you're not ignoring
what you truly want?

248
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,580
Thank you.

249
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,790
Shirasaki.

250
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,790
But it's alright.

251
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,210
Living up to others' expectations...

252
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,960
is my job.

253
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,170
Asami-san.

254
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,670
Can I sleep with you tonight?

255
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,670
What about our "in-house separation"?

256
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,000
Is that over now?

257
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,580
Yeah.

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,290
It's over.

259
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,330
I see.

260
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,920
Shirasaki.

261
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,210
The audition results are in.

262
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,920
Yeah.

263
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,170
Hello?

264
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,960
Asami-san?

265
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,250
I... I got the part.

266
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,210
Congratulations.

267
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,710
Shirasaki.

268
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,710
I still can't believe it.

269
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
This calls for a celebration.

270
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Huh?

271
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,750
Wait...

272
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,040
Oh, you don't have to.

273
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,000
I want to celebrate you.

274
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,670
Okay?

275
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,960
Okay.

276
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,710
Shirasaki.

277
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,670
I need to discuss the rehearsal space...

278
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,790
I'll head over now.

279
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,290
Okay.

280
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,130
Good luck.

281
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,130
Right.

282
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,580
(Rain and Confession)

283
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,290
(This is a work of fiction.)

284
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,750
(Next Episode)
I told you, I did nothing!

285
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,330
A standard performance won't cut it.

286
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,580
Hayama-san, what I need from you on set
is your raw, honest emotion.

287
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,670
What's wrong?

288
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,630
Did something happen?

289
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,630
Am I really there for Asami-san?

290
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,500
I can't believe someone attacked me in my sleep.
