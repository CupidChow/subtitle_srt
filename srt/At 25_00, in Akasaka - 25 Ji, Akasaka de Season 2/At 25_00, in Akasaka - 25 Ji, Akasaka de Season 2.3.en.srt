1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,670
Let's break up.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,630
Break up with Shirasaki.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,880
Thanks for everything.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,630
Goodbye.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,710
That was just an act.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,250
I have no intention of breaking up.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,540
You have to protect...

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,170
protect Shirasaki.

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,750
And yourself.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,040
Shirasaki.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Want to move?

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,130
Huh?

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,250
Want to live together?

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,880
With me.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,830
Huh? B-But...

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,000
If we get caught...

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,710
Besides, Akeno-san will never agree.

18
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll take care of Akeno-san.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,170
If it's a place with good security,

20
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,960
it'll be harder for paparazzi to get photos.

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,420
It'd be safer than us going
back and forth to each other's places, right?

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,880
And...

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,040
we could be together all the time.

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Yeah.

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,710
Yeah.

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,130
This is so stylish.

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,830
- Asami-san.
- Hmm?

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,670
You have something like this at your place, right?

29
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,750
I do.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
I don't have anything like this at my place.

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,250
Ah.

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,880
It's beautiful. So cool.

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,380
Asami-san, this one.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,750
What do you think?

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,540
How does it feel to sit in?

36
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,750
It's perfect.

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Really?

38
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,750
Ah...

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,790
This is nice.

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,830
Yeah.

41
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,750
So we're going with this one?

42
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,830
Okay.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,580
I can't believe it.

44
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,460
We're actually going to live together.

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,960
Hold on tight.

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Okay.

47
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,420
Okay.

48
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,710
Is this the last box?

49
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,830
Yes.

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,750
This place is bigger than I thought.

51
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,580
Well, my bed took up most of the space before.

52
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,330
This was the first ordinary room
I rented after coming to Tokyo.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,540
But...

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,960
it's filled with so many memories.

55
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,710
This will also be the last time
Asami-san comes to this room.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,460
Yeah.

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,670
Um...

58
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,290
Every time you came here, Asami-san,

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,920
it made me feel like all my past struggles
had finally paid off.

60
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,630
Every day that you visited

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,880
was a special day for me.

62
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,290
Do you...

63
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,500
not want to move?

64
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,250
No, that's not it.

65
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,670
It's just that so much has happened here.

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,330
The next place...

67
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,080
will become just as special in no time.

68
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,210
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 3)

69
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,330
Good work today.

70
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm so glad you were able to move.

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,130
I was always worried about
the security at your old apartment.

72
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Sorry about that.

73
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,630
I also spoke with Akeno-san.

74
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,540
As long as you're happy, Shirasaki,

75
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,920
I'll support you quietly.

76
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,080
Thank you.

77
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,790
The rent is higher, so I'll have to work harder.

78
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,290
Right.

79
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,250
Here.

80
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,920
What's this?

81
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,290
The play, "Rain and Confession".

82
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,960
The director is Aoyama Ruiichiro.

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right, the Aoyama-san
who's won countless theater awards.

84
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,670
Please, tell me more.

85
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,630
Aoyama-san...

86
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,170
He's always worked exclusively with veteran actors.

87
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,960
I heard he's holding auditions
for the first time in ten years.

88
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,920
Alright, that's all for today.

89
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,630
Akeno-san.

90
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,080
What does my schedule look like
around this fall?

91
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,250
We're currently in talks for one TV series
and one single-episode drama.

92
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,960
There's also a film offer.

93
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,960
But we haven't responded to it yet.

94
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,290
Why do you ask?

95
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,920
This.

96
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,380
I want to audition for this.

97
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,040
"Rain and Confession".

98
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,630
What kind of story is "Rain and Confession"?

99
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,380
The original work is a novel
by Kogure Prize-winning author Ogikubo Satoshi.

100
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,580
The protagonist commits murder
and impersonates the man he killed.

101
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,750
It's a work that depicts human desire and tragedy.

102
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,630
Like "Purple Noon"?

103
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,380
Yes...

104
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,540
Sounds interesting.

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,920
There are only four actors in the entire cast.

106
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,710
I hear that regardless of experience,

107
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,750
everyone will be chosen
through the same audition process.

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,920
Shirasaki.

109
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,750
What do you think?

110
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
- I'll do it.
- So decisive.

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to be on Aoyama-san's stage.

112
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,580
Please let me audition.

113
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,960
I understand you want to do this play.

114
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,210
But... for Hayama right now,

115
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,790
is this really necessary?

116
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,290
Rehearsals will take over a month.

117
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,710
On top of that, there's the show itself
and the regional tour.

118
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,710
That's three months in total.

119
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,420
During that time,

120
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,170
you won't be able to take on any other jobs.

121
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,460
Even so, I want to do it.

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,230
Because I believe this is something
that's necessary ​for me right now.

123
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,460
I understand.

124
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
I'll adjust your schedule.

125
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,080
Thank you.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,170
("Rain and Confession" by Ogikubo Satoshi)

127
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Asami-san.

128
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,960
Can I get some help?

129
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,790
Yeah.

130
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,170
Shirasaki.

131
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,210
Did you know they have furniture assembly services?

132
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,330
Asami-san, please get the other side.

133
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,790
- Yeah.
- For stuff like this,

134
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,790
you can just ask the company,
and they'll send someone to build it.

135
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,750
Please fit it in there.

136
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,710
Not here, over here.

137
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,040
Sorry.

138
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,630
Okay.

139
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,040
That's good now.

140
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,420
Okay.

141
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,920
Next up is...

142
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,540
Use screw A...

143
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,380
to connect the side panel and the bottom panel.

144
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,420
This is it, right?

145
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,830
Which one is the screw?

146
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,920
Come on, help me.

147
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,880
I am helping.

148
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,670
Do you enjoy this?

149
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,250
Assembling things.

150
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,830
It's not that I like or dislike it.

151
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,420
With two people, stuff like this
gets done in a flash.

152
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,880
You just naturally assumed
I'd be helping, didn't you?

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,540
Isn't that a given?

154
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,250
Besides, you'll be using it too, Asami-san.

155
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,790
"Using it" isn't quite the right word.

156
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,040
Huh?

157
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,250
It's nothing.

158
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,420
You'll let me borrow it sometimes, right?

159
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,830
Jeez.

160
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,750
We'll never finish this.

161
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,000
This way, even in Shirasaki's room,

162
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,920
we can do all the naughty things we want.

163
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,580
All we want.

164
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,250
Then let's hurry up and build this.

165
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,880
Suddenly, you're motivated.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,420
So where were we?

167
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,380
We just finished step six.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,630
Use screw A...

(Stage Play "Rain and Confession"
Second Round Auditions - Waiting Room)

170
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,040
Morning.

171
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,830
Morning.

172
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,170
You're Shirasaki-san, right?

173
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,580
Yes.

174
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,040
I loved you in "Daydream".

175
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,750
I've always hoped I'd get to act with you someday.

176
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,000
Thank you.

177
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,710
My name is Kuroki Keita.

178
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm Shirasaki Yuki.

179
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,790
I wonder how many people will pass this second round.

180
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,500
I have no idea.

181
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,880
I heard there were about two thousand applicants.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,170
What?

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,540
That many?

184
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,830
But it seems the auditions aren't just today.
They'll continue tomorrow as well.

185
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,130
Will numbers 16 through 20 please
proceed to the audition hall.

186
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,210
Yes.

187
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,880
Excuse us.

188
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,790
Good morning.

189
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,380
Good morning.

190
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,750
Good morning.

191
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,040
Good morning.

192
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,880
Please, have a seat.

193
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,790
Thank you.

194
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,290
I'm the producer, Nozawa.

195
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,380
Thank you all for coming today.

196
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,580
For the protagonist, the core of this production,

197
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,080
we are looking for someone who can portray complex emotions
with both subtlety and strength.

198
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,250
Most importantly,

199
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,500
we hope to find someone
who can share in Director Aoyama's passion

200
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,920
and build this play together.

201
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,420
We look forward to your performances.

202
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,630
Let's begin with self-introductions.

203
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,830
Number 16, Mr. Kuroki.

204
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,290
Yes.

205
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,710
I'm Kuroki Keita.

206
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,330
I plan to make this project
my signature role.

207
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,460
I hope to connect with the main character,
Muroga Jun, more deeply than anyone.

208
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,170
His loneliness and his vulnerability.

209
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,710
I want to get closer to him than anyone else.

210
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,080
My name is Keita.

211
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,750
The "Kei" in my name means firefly.

212
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,750
But unlike a firefly, I don't shine,
and I'm often overlooked.

213
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,460
I hope that like a firefly,

214
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,920
even if it's just a little,

215
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,170
I can light a spark in someone's heart.

216
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,920
Thank you for your consideration.

217
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,290
Thank you.

218
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,040
Next, number 17, Mr. Shirasaki.

219
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,540
Yes.

220
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,040
I'm Shirasaki Yuki.

221
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,880
The reason I wanted to be in this production

222
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,960
is because I learned the director is Aoyama Ruiichiro.

223
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,830
The first...

224
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,170
Um...

225
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,250
After I came to Tokyo,

226
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,670
the first play I ever saw

227
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,170
was Mr. Aoyama's "The Silent Spiral".

228
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,460
I was completely blown away.

229
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,000
I hope that,

230
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,040
together with Mr. Aoyama,

231
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,500
I can help shape and
bring the character of Muroga Jun to life.

232
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,210
Thank you for your consideration.

233
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,420
Thank you.

234
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,000
Alright, number 18, Mr. Inoue.

235
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,250
Yes.

236
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,130
Thank you.

237
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,250
That concludes today's auditions.

238
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,830
Could you wait a moment?

239
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr. Kuroki, and... Mr. Shirasaki.

240
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,250
Could you show us a little more?

241
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,500
Huh?

242
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,500
- Well... how about a little improv?
- Yes.

243
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,710
There's no script,

244
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,210
but I'd like you two to play Muroga and Mitarai.

245
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,460
Okay.

246
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,670
Okay.

247
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,000
Then I'll play Muroga.

248
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,000
And you can be Mitarai.

249
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,920
Excuse me.

250
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,330
Could you please try to imagine

251
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,420
and act out a scene that isn't in the script?

252
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,330
- Yes.
- Okay.

253
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,420
- I look forward to working with you.
- Same here.

254
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,960
Here we go.

255
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,920
And... action.

256
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,540
It's been... two years, hasn't it?

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Two years already...

258
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,540
Mitarai.

259
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,040
When I first came to this village,

260
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,290
do you remember?

261
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,750
I'm home.

262
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,540
Welcome back.

263
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Huh?

264
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,040
What are you doing?

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,380
Making your favorite gyoza.

266
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,790
Awesome!

267
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,420
Let me help.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,380
The meat...

269
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,790
Is that all you're putting in?

270
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,880
They're better with mostly vegetables.

271
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,250
Sorry.

272
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,670
Can you get the oyster sauce from the fridge?

273
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,920
Hmm?

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,540
As you can see,

275
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,420
my hands are a little full right now.

276
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,290
Even if you try to sweet-talk me like that,

277
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,670
there's nothing I can do.
You're putting me in a tough spot.

278
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,920
But your mouth is free, isn't it?

279
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,920
Hey, stop it...

280
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,830
That tickles.

281
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,960
If you don't help wrap, you don't get to eat.

282
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,130
Fine...

283
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,750
Oyster sauce, right?

284
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Yeah.

285
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,420
Time to eat.

286
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,790
Go ahead.

287
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,580
These are delicious with mostly vegetables.

288
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,380
You have a unique way with compliments.

289
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,920
Delicious.

290
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,500
They really are.

291
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,880
Cheers.

292
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,330
This is nice, though.

293
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,080
Hmm?

294
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,250
Now that you've moved,

295
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,750
I'm so happy we can see each other anytime.

296
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,540
Everything's so good.

297
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,460
Oh.

298
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,670
Good work today.

299
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,000
You too.

300
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,040
Are you here today for...?

301
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,880
An interview for a drama series.

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,630
Um... do you mind if I sit here?

303
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,080
Of course, please do.

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,920
Thank you for taking such good care of our Shirasaki.

305
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,460
I should be the one saying that.

306
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,790
Ever since he worked with Hayama-san
on "Daydream",

307
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,460
Shirasaki has really grown as an actor.

308
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,170
It seems they've had
a great influence on each other.

309
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,960
You know, Hayama...

310
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,250
almost never complains about work.

311
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,960
Is that so?
Yeah.

312
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,290
He's been like that since his modeling days.

313
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,830
Whatever job comes his way, he takes it.

314
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,880
And once he takes it, he gives it his all.

315
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,330
That's impressive.

316
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,210
However,

317
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,330
the one time he decided to take on an acting job,

318
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,130
was the rare occasion he asked for it himself.

319
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,630
Alright, that's all for today.

320
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,210
Good work.

321
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,880
Yes.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Akeno-san, um...

323
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,290
Yes?

324
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,130
I want to try acting.

325
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,170
And now,

326
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,170
he's the lead in a drama series.

327
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,250
He's really a blue-chip talent, isn't he?

328
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,170
That's a strange way to put it.

329
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,000
Good morning.

330
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,080
Actors auditioning for Mitarai,

331
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,790
please wear this name tag on your chest
before entering the waiting room.

332
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,580
Good morning.

333
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm Shirasaki Yuki.

334
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,670
Okay, actors auditioning for Muroga,

335
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,790
please wear this name tag on your chest
before entering the waiting room.

336
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,130
Okay.

337
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,920
Yes!

338
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,750
Good morning.

339
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,460
Shirasaki-san.

340
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,130
Oh... hello.

341
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,580
I knew we'd meet again.

342
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,920
Let's do our best in the third round.

343
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,500
Let's.

344
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,500
Hey, isn't that Shirasaki?

345
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,330
Sakuma-san...

346
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,380
So you're auditioning too.

347
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,170
Are you also here
for the role of Muroga, Sakuma-san?

348
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,580
No, I'm trying out for the role of Fukuyama.

349
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,750
See? The color is different.

350
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,330
You're right.

351
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,880
I hope we can perform on stage together.

352
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,670
Yeah.

353
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,630
Look.

354
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,580
Wait...

355
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,920
He's here too?

356
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,960
No way.

357
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,290
You've got to be kidding me.

358
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,040
What are we gonna do?

359
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,380
(This story is a work of fiction.)

360
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,960
(Next Episode)
The acting evaluation will proceed in numerical order

361
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,630
in pairs of two.

362
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,670
No, that's not what I was thinking.

363
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,880
No.

364
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,540
Are you trying to get in my way too?

365
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,380
Asami-san.

366
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,330
Until this audition is over,

367
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,130
could you please keep your distance?

368
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,500
I don't want to lose to you, Asami-san.

369
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,500
Asami-san, what are you...

370
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,210
