1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,000
He's here too?

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,700
No way.

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,000
For real?

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,970
What a rare sight.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,000
Hayama, at an audition?

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,130
Sakuma, you're here too.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,530
Yeah.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,530
You're in the same boat.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,070
Looks that way.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,970
Yes.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,530
Honda.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,200
Huh? It's Sakuma.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,300
What do you mean, "huh?"

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,130
You guys know each other?
Yeah.

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,200
We used to run into each other at auditions all the time.

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,500
For a while, every audition I went to...

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,430
we'd end up seeing each other like this.

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,770
So you're a rival of Sakuma-san's?

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,530
Uh...

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,700
I guess you could say that.

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,700
But if you're going to put it that way...

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,300
then we all are.

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,770
Everyone here is a rival.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,200
Anyway, let's both do our best.

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,570
Honda.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,770
- Um...
- Sorry to keep you all waiting.

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,530
Now, if everyone could please move to the audition room.

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay.

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,330
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 4)

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,970
I will now explain the scene you'll be performing.

32
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,930
Having killed the real Muroga Jun...

33
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,870
the protagonist takes his place.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,670
His real name is Nakamura Yusaku.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,330
However, one day,
a man who knows the protagonist's past...

36
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,300
a man named Fukuyama, arrives from Tokyo.

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,630
This scene is where Fukuyama confronts Muroga
about his crimes.

38
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,430
The acting evaluation will be conducted
in pairs according to your number.

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,800
We'll be calling you in order.

40
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,300
Please check your number.

41
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,800
Let the evaluations begin.

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,630
I know everything.

43
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,970
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.

44
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,470
I don't know.

46
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,370
It wasn't me.

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,170
It was you, Muroga.

48
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,330
No.

49
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,200
Nakamura Yusaku.

50
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,170
I knew it.

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,000
You're the one who killed Muroga.

52
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't understand what you mean.

53
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,870
You and Muroga were rivals, weren't you?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,030
That's not it.

55
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,700
Muroga was always one step ahead of you.

56
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,530
So you always saw him as a threat.

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,700
You were annoyed, envious,
and even wanted him dead.

58
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,700
No.

59
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,570
I never thought that.

60
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,870
You're not gentle at all.

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,330
You're actually a cunning,
cold, and despicable person.

62
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,970
That's why you killed him and took his place, isn't it?

63
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,500
You too?

64
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,370
Are you also here to get in my way?

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,700
If that's the case...

66
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,430
Okay, thank you both.

67
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,070
Next group, please.

69
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,330
I know everything.

70
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,000
Stop pretending you don't know.

71
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
I don't know.

73
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,300
- It wasn't me.
- It was you, Muroga.

74
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,500
No.

75
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,000
Nakamura Yusaku.

76
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,870
I knew it.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,570
You killed him.

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,330
You killed the real Muroga Jun.

79
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,700
I don't understand.

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,970
You and Muroga were rivals, right?

81
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,970
That's not it.

82
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,000
Muroga was always one step ahead of you.

83
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,530
So you always saw him as a threat.

84
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,430
Annoyed...

85
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,800
envious...

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,930
and even wanted him dead.

87
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,300
No.

88
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,800
I never thought that.

89
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,330
You're not gentle at all.

90
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,430
You're actually a cunning,
cold, and despicable person.

91
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,800
That's why...

92
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,970
you killed him and took his place, isn't it?

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
You too?

94
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,430
Are you also here to get in my way?

95
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,830
In that case...

96
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,770
Okay, thank you both.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,330
Hayama-san.

98
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,800
That part in the beginning where you tried to
brush it off with a smile...

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,770
really brought out the cunning nature
of Nakamura Yusaku.

100
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,800
I thought that was excellent.

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,130
Thank you very much.

102
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,670
No, thank you.

103
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,270
Enjoy your meal.

104
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,370
What the heck?

105
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
Why was I the only one who didn't get it?

106
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,500
How long are you going to keep this up?

107
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,200
I'm so frustrated.

108
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,970
- I'm the only one who lost.
- Come on...

109
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,700
There's no winning or losing in an audition.

110
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,130
It's about whether you're right for the role.

111
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,430
And your chemistry with the other actors.

112
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,470
It's a combination of all those factors.

113
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,630
I know all that in theory.

114
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,130
But it still sucks.

115
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,170
What's wrong?

116
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,330
Oh, it's nothing. Just remembered something.

117
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,500
What is it?

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,830
Remember Honda?

119
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,000
The one I did the scene with today.

120
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,370
Right.

121
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,370
We competed against each other in auditions many times.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,170
Sometimes I'd get the part...

123
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,670
and sometimes he would.

124
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,500
Once, at an audition for a certain project...

125
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,870
I was the one who got chosen.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,830
But it never sat right with me.

127
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,030
Why?

128
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,470
Because I saw Honda's performance at the audition...

129
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,370
and I thought he was so much better than me.

130
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,930
It's a world without clear winners or losers.

131
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,800
That makes it tough, doesn't it?

132
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,000
After all, what's considered "good" is subjective.

133
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,370
Exactly. There's no absolute right or wrong.

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,870
No real wins or losses.

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,570
So it makes you wonder...
what you should hold onto to keep going.

136
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,200
Sakuma, what keeps you going?

137
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,700
I don't know. But for me...

138
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,200
it's not that I'm thinking...

139
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,070
"I have to beat Hayama."

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,630
Or Shirasaki, or Yamase.

141
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,030
I've never thought about beating any of you.

142
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,370
But...

143
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,200
I don't want to lose either.

144
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,500
Sorry, that was random. Here.

145
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,700
Drink up.

146
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,370
Then it's your treat today.

147
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Yeah, yeah, I know.

148
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,370
Alright...

149
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

150
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,630
Why didn't I get the part?

151
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Asami-san.

152
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,070
Hmm?

153
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,130
Until this audition is over...

154
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,930
should we maybe keep some distance?

155
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,930
I want to keep our distance for now.

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,630
Let's try not to see each other.

157
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,470
Even for meals...

158
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,870
we should eat in our own rooms.

159
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,470
Isn't that basically like living separately?

160
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,930
We only just started living together.

161
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,130
No, it's not forever.

162
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,870
Just until the audition is over.

163
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,070
Sakuma-san said it too.

164
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,830
We are, for all intents and purposes, rivals.

165
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,870
Rivals.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
At least, that's the mindset I want to have.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,330
I want to catch up to you,
Asami-san, as quickly as I can.

168
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,930
Regardless of the audition's outcome...

169
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,030
I want to be able to stand beside you
with my head held high.

170
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,770
I can't just... switch gears that easily.

171
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,930
If things stay as they are...

172
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,700
I might end up just relying on you.

173
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,270
I understand.

174
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,870
If that's what you want, Shirasaki...

175
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,130
then let's do it that way.

176
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,370
Thank you.

177
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,030
Asami-san.

178
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,200
Well then...

179
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,500
Good night.

180
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,270
Asami-san.

181
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,270
I don't want to lose to you, Asami-san.

182
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,430
Asami-san...

183
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,530
What are you thinking?

184
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,300
It's nothing.

185
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,070
Never mind.

186
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,970
Good night.

187
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,570
Morning.

188
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm heading out for work.

189
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,000
Is there any point to this?

190
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,170
I want to touch Shirasaki.

191
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,870
It's been so long. I just want to touch him.

192
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,570
Ta-da!

193
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,700
I heard that for this brand's
new campaign...

194
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,470
Shirasaki's name is on the list of candidates.

195
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,370
- Huh? Me?
- Yep.

196
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,300
The spokesperson for this brand...

197
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,570
Asami-san used to be it, right?

198
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,130
That's right.

199
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,130
The person in charge also said...

200
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,870
that when Hayama was the face of the brand,
it was a huge sensation.

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
They said sales went up quite a bit.

202
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,070
Being the spokesperson for the same ad as Hayama-san.

203
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,130
If I actually get the part,

204
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,070
the pressure would be insane, right?

205
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,770
Huh?

206
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,530
Because we'd definitely be compared.

207
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,330
You're amazing too, Shirasaki.

208
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,700
I don't think you'd lose.

209
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,030
Thank you.

210
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,430
Shinoda-san.

211
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,270
I want this job.

212
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,530
Let's work together and make you the spokesperson.

213
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,430
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,070
Okay.

215
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,800
Look who's here. How long has it been?

216
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,700
It's rare to see you here for a drink, Hayama.

217
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,870
Sorry for coming before you opened.

218
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,300
It's fine. I'll just be sure to charge you
the after-hours fee.

219
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,830
That sounds expensive.

220
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,870
I'll have a drink, too.

221
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,300
Mihara.

222
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,530
Yeah?

223
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,530
Is there anyone you want to beat?

224
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,630
Huh?

225
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,370
Where did that come from?

226
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,030
Well...

227
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,870
Just wondering.

228
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,630
Sure.

229
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,170
- You do?
- Yeah.

230
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,800
I want to beat the people who look down on me.

231
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,300
Or anyone who gives me a hard time.

232
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,700
I want to crush them completely.

233
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,200
Beat them so badly they're left speechless.

234
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,470
That's so you.

235
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,000
Then...

236
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,670
Is there anyone you "don't" want to lose to?

237
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Huh? What was that?

238
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,570
What do you mean?

239
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,300
Didn't I just answer that?

240
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,670
Someone you want to beat.

241
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Is that the same as someone you don't want to lose to?

242
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,070
Or is it different?

243
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,530
Oh, that's what you mean.

244
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,670
Hmm...

245
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,500
What's the difference, anyway?

246
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,330
I guess it's like this.

247
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,500
- This is me.
- And...

248
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,870
"Wanting to win"...

249
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,500
is like this.

250
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,000
"Wanting to win" is about surpassing them.

251
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,930
Wanting to be stronger, to stand above them.

252
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,200
And then, not wanting to lose...

253
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,170
is about wanting to be their equal.

254
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,270
Their equal.

255
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,630
I want to catch up to Asami-san.

256
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,800
Mihara.

257
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,170
Thank you.

258
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,170
I don't really know what that was about,

259
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,800
but you're welcome.

260
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,830
Huh? Leaving already?

261
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't worry about it.

262
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,170
That drink I gave you...
was a cocktail I was practicing.

263
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,430
Oh.

264
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,330
Was it?

265
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,530
I used you as a guinea pig.

266
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,000
So it's on the house.

267
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,470
You haven't changed a bit, Mihara.

268
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,800
Is that a compliment or an insult?

269
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
The former.

270
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,830
Of course.

271
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,430
Then I'll take you up on that.

272
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,130
Thanks for the drink.

273
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,170
You, on the other hand, have changed, Hayama.

274
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,470
Uh...

275
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,200
In what way?

276
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,770
You've become human.

277
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,500
I've always been human.

278
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,330
I mean you seem more human now.

279
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,270
It's a good thing.

280
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,270
If you ask me.

281
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,000
Excuse me...

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Shirasaki.

283
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,030
Welcome back.

284
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,370
I... I'm home.

285
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,470
I know.

286
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,270
We have to keep our distance, right?

287
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,830
Yeah.

288
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,570
There's just one thing

289
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,470
I want to tell you.

290
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,270
Just let me say it.

291
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,570
It's the same for me.

292
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,670
I don't want to lose to you either.

293
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,070
Shirasaki.

294
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,630
You might feel like you're always chasing me,

295
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
but the truth is, it's the same for me.

296
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,670
I'm also...

297
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,430
always chasing you.

298
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,800
I...

299
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,830
I've always admired you, Asami-san.

300
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,630
No, I thought you were incredible.

301
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,770
Completely unreachable.

302
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,570
But I always hoped that one day I could catch up.

303
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,770
To stand by your side as an equal.

304
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,830
So...

305
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,570
even if you're lying

306
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,800
about not wanting to lose to me,

307
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,370
I'm still happy.

308
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,030
I'm not lying.

309
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,930
Huh?

310
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,800
I've said it before.

311
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,330
The reason I'm able to do this job now

312
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,330
is all because of you.

313
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,970
Asami-san...

314
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,170
I made it to the final round of auditions.

315
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,300
Congratulations.

316
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,030
Asami-san.

317
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,270
Me too.

318
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,530
I made it too.

319
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,470
Congratulations.

320
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,930
But of course you did.

321
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,470
You're Hayama Asami, after all.

322
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,170
So now,

323
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,530
we're officially rivals.

324
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,700
Yes.

325
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,970
But.

326
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,330
Nothing will change.

327
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,130
No matter the outcome.

328
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,570
Between you and me,

329
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,030
nothing will change.

330
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,670
Okay.

331
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,630
Sorry for calling you out here so suddenly.

332
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,770
It's fine.

333
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,570
Did something happen?

334
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,630
Hayama.

335
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,830
There's something I need to ask you.

336
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,130
This audition...

337
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I need you to drop out.

338
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,300
(This is a work of fiction.)

339
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,170
(Next Episode)
I... want to see this audition through to the end.

340
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,170
For your career,

341
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,770
this is a critical turning point.

342
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,130
I hope you'll lend me your strength, Hayama-san.

343
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,700
If the job you want to do

344
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,970
conflicts with the job you should do,

345
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,530
what would you do, Sakuma?

346
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,070
I think you have a choice.

347
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,630
The choice to do what you really want, Hayama.

348
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,270
Akeno-san.

349
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,830
I... The audition results are in.

350
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,930
Can I sleep with you tonight?
