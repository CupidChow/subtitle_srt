1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,540
Mom?

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,130
I got a package addressed to you.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,290
Who sent it?

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,540
It's from your father.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,630
Please give me some advice.

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,250
Trust me.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,130
That was great.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,880
It's Kuroki-san.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,630
What time should we meet tomorrow?

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,790
Eight o'clock?

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,580
Isn't that a little early?

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,540
Asami-san.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,210
I'm heading out to practice with Kuroki-san.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,040
Oh...

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,460
Kuroki again, huh?

16
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,130
It was a letter from my father.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,580
Asami.

18
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,540
I trust you're doing well.

19
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,670
As an actor,

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,290
you seem to be quite successful.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,540
The novel I wrote...

22
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,540
I wonder if you've received it.

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,710
Although it's a work of fiction,

24
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,290
half of it is based on my own experiences.

25
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,710
You could call it my autobiography.

26
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,170
A production company in the UK

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,630
has decided to adapt it into a film.

28
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,880
They seem to be the best team to entrust my work to.

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,130
If you, Asami, could play the lead role,

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,580
I would be very happy.

31
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,080
Me... to play that father of mine?

32
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,880
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 8)

33
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,000
That's him.

34
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,920
Hello, are you from the inn?

35
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,250
No.

36
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm the head of this village. My name is Goto.

37
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,080
- Hello, Village Head. I'm Fukuyama.
- I see.

38
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,330
Fukuyama-san, are you here on vacation?

39
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,540
No, I'm here to see a friend.

40
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,500
Oh?

41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,080
- So you're Muroga's friend.
- That's right. "Muroga's" friend.

42
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,880
Your real name...

43
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,580
It's a nice name.

44
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,250
Why?

45
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,790
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,420
I followed you.

47
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,130
I understand everything now.

48
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,750
Why you came here, and that incident.

49
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,750
The way you've been acting strangely lately...
Everything.

50
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,170
The man you fell for, Muroga...

51
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,630
doesn't exist in this world.

52
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,250
Okay, thank you, both of you.

53
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,960
Yeah.

54
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,500
Excellent.

55
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,540
The expression was spot-on.

56
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,420
It was good, right, Fujioka?

57
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,540
It was fantastic.

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,460
Alright then...

59
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,920
Let's take a short break.

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
We'll fine-tune the details after.

61
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,040
- Let's take fifteen.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,630
Okay, fifteen-minute break.

63
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Kuroki-san.

64
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,750
Hmm?

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,540
I wanted to go over the last scene with you...

66
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,170
Oh.

67
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,920
It's our break right now. Are you sure?

68
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,830
Yeah, it's fine.

69
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,130
Good work.

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,630
Yamase-san.
Good work.

71
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,670
Oh... you're here.

72
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,830
This is Yamase, he's a junior actor at my agency.

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,830
Hello, everyone.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Sorry to intrude.

75
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,630
Please let him observe and learn.

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,670
Ah, this... if you don't mind.

77
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,330
Please, everyone, have some.

78
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,420
Yuki, here.

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,830
Yamase-san, you shouldn't have...

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,920
Yuki.

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,580
It's common courtesy.

82
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,630
You're one to talk about "courtesy"...

83
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,960
Did you see that last scene?

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,540
I caught it from the doorway.

85
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,790
The scene with Muroga and Mitarai was amazing.

86
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
Thanks.

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,580
He actually auditioned for this too.
Got cut in the first round.

88
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,540
That's not true! It wasn't the first round,
it was the second.

89
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,380
- The second round.
- Oh, sorry.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,670
Kuroki-san, would you like one?

91
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,750
Sure, thanks.

92
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,290
Don't mind if I do.

93
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,920
Yamase-san, I'm digging in.

94
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,130
Please do.

95
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,000
Not bad.

96
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,960
- It's whatever.
- So, did you see my scene?

97
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,250
Well...

98
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,880
You didn't see it, huh?

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Yamase-san, this is delicious!

100
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,380
Glad to hear it.

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,790
You've got some cream on you.

102
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,960
Hmm?

103
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,250
Thanks.

104
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,540
Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,460
(Rain and Confession)

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,170
(Shirasaki Yuki, Kuroki Keita)

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,080
Hello?

108
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,460
Ah, Hayama?

109
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,880
Want to go out for a drink tonight?

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Tonight...

111
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,710
I think I'll pass tonight.

112
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,250
Not in the mood?

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,830
I need to really dig into this movie script.

114
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,710
Actually, Yamase came by today.

115
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,960
We don't have rehearsal tomorrow,
so we decided to go for drinks.

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,880
This guy named Kuroki is coming too.

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,250
Kuroki?

118
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,920
Yeah, the guy playing Shirasaki's best friend.

119
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
But, if it's a bad time for you...

120
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,170
No, I'll go.

121
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,500
You will?

122
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,580
See you at the usual spot, then.

123
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,330
Yeah.

124
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,630
Okay.

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,290
Huh, he's here first.

126
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,130
- That's a first.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,500
Sorry, rehearsal ran late.

128
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,710
No worries.

129
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,670
Wow, this is amazing.

130
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,830
- This is my first time here, I'm blown away.
- There we go.

131
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,540
Ah, Asami-san.

132
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,880
Let me introduce you.
This is Kuroki Keita-san.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,630
I'm Kuroki. It's a pleasure.

134
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,380
My name is Hayama.

135
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,790
Nice to meet you.

136
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,330
Alright, have a seat.

137
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,250
Okay.

138
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,920
- Ah, Kuroki-san, let me take your bag.
- Thanks.

139
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,170
Let's drink a lot tonight!

140
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,500
Let's do it.

141
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,290
What are you guys drinking?

142
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,460
Um... beer.

143
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,210
- Beer?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,000
Hayama, the usual?

145
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,330
- Ah...
- Which one?

146
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,250
- Red wine.
- Got it.

147
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,170
I'll have a draft beer. A heavy one.

148
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,500
What's a heavy draft beer?

149
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,500
Cheers.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,790
Huh?

151
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,250
Aoyama-san didn't approve at first.

152
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, he even thought about swapping their roles.

153
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,960
I don't know if he was serious.

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,250
But it made me break out in a cold sweat.

155
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,170
But thanks to Kuroki-san's help...

156
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,000
Help?

157
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,710
When I got to the rehearsal space this morning,

158
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,330
I heard a lot of noise.

159
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,960
Calling me noisy is a bit much.

160
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,210
When I was practicing on my own,

161
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,250
Kuroki-san came and ran lines with me.

162
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,080
Yeah.

163
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,210
Thanks to him, I started to get a feel for
how to play the character of Muroga.

164
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,420
How should I put it?

165
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,170
Instead of just thinking with my head,

166
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,920
I was able to act on instinct.

167
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,460
I really felt that.

168
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,420
Oh?

169
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,880
It's like you had room to react to
your scene partner's performance.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,710
Really?

171
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,790
Yeah.

172
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
Doing scenes with Shirasaki felt incredibly liberating.

173
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,750
I'm so happy.

174
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,500
Is it the same for you, Hayama-san?

175
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,540
Huh?

176
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,080
No, I mean...
Your performance in "Daydream" was incredible.

177
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,580
The way you portrayed the space between two people
as they fell in love was perfect.

178
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,460
So good that it made me wonder
if you were actually dating in real life.

179
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,080
To receive such a compliment from you...

180
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,250
As an actor, it's the highest honor.

181
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,710
Thank you.

182
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,880
Organizing all these things logically...

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,170
to flesh out the character...

184
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,500
I get it, I get all that theory.

185
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,170
But that feeling of becoming
one with the character...

186
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,710
That's not the point.

187
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,580
How do I say this...

188
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,170
Of course, the historical context is important.

189
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,080
They're really getting into it.

190
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,330
I think those things are important.

191
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,670
So, how was it?

192
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,330
How was what?

193
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,920
The rehearsal.

194
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
You went, didn't you?

195
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,290
Well... yeah.

196
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,880
It was good.

197
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,540
Yuki was full of energy, too.

198
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,630
After all...

199
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,580
at the end, when Muroga tries to kill himself,
Mitarai stops him.

200
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,460
The scene between them
is going to get even more intense.

201
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,130
When that happens,

202
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,290
the bond between the actors is sure to deepen.

203
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,540
Especially Shirasaki.

204
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,040
He's the type to get really into his role, isn't he?

205
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,330
He gets completely absorbed in his scene partner.

206
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,170
Doesn't that worry you?

207
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,920
Worried about what?

208
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,130
It's nothing.

209
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,170
I had a great time today.

210
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,380
It's been so long since we all went out for drinks.

211
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,040
It has.

212
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,790
Huh?

213
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,960
Asami-san, didn't you have fun?

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,420
I had a great time, but...

215
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,170
But?

216
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,920
Huh?

217
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,710
What's wrong?

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,920
Hey, something seems off about you.

219
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,210
Huh?

220
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,670
Huh?

221
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,000
Ah.

222
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,540
Don't tell me you're...

223
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,170
jealous?

224
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,750
Jealous?

225
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,630
Yeah, the envious kind of jealous.

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,170
I don't have much experience with this feeling,

227
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,080
so I'm not entirely sure.

228
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,500
Hmm, but...

229
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,460
haven't you acted jealous before, Asami-san?

230
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,170
You know, that feeling of jealousy.

231
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,290
That's true.

232
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,580
When it comes to acting,

233
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
you observe good examples and commit them to memory,

234
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,080
and then you perform them.

235
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,080
Though I have been wanting to change that.

236
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,210
Um, was the touching intentional?

237
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,710
Yeah.

238
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,000
Because you and Kuroki were so chummy.

239
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,580
See? You are jealous.

240
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,210
There's no reason to be.

241
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,290
I never knew

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,460
I had this kind of emotion inside me.

243
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,330
Shirasaki is so endearing.

244
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,960
It's making it harder to let him go,
and that scares me a little.

245
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,380
Hey...

246
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,040
Yeah?

247
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,960
The play is about to open,

248
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,080
and my show is about to start filming.

249
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,830
How about we go somewhere before then?

250
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,330
Huh?

251
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,540
You mean... on a date?

252
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,420
Because we're both about to get a lot busier.

253
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,790
I want to go.

254
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,580
I really want to. Can we?

255
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,540
My dad's...

256
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,500
self-serving tales from his past.

257
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,580
How am I...

258
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,040
supposed to face him?

259
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,420
You can head home, Yamase.

260
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,750
It's fine. I'll stay with you.

261
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,750
Thank you.

262
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,210
Sakuma.

263
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,830
On set, are you always
just cleaning up after Yuki and the others?

264
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,630
Huh?

265
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,330
That's just the feeling I got watching you rehearse today.

266
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,040
Hmm.

267
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,790
Putting your own needs aside...

268
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,420
That's not right, is it?

269
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,830
That's not it.

270
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,170
I mean that a lot of people
can relax because you're there.

271
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,330
Stop focusing on what everyone else does well.

272
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,460
You need to recognize your own strengths.

273
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,500
Yamase, you're a good guy.

274
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,420
Come on, drink up...

275
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,790
Hey, don't drink too much.

276
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,210
I'm the one who'll have to take care of you.

277
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,420
I know.

278
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,460
I'll pour...

279
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,540
Just a little... Hey, that's too much.

280
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,580
- Jeez.
- Here.

281
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,330
- Cheers.
- Okay.

282
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,630
We're leaving after this drink.

283
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,670
Hmm?

284
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,290
- I don't wanna go home.
- Time to go.

285
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,500
- No way.
- You've had too much to drink.

286
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,920
I told you, I'm fine.

287
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,170
Huh?

288
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,960
You two are going on a date?

289
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,580
Yeah.

290
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,040
Um...

291
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,210
Back then,

292
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,080
thanks for everything.

293
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,750
Huh?

294
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,330
Have we met somewhere before?

295
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,750
No...

296
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,710
I mean, it's not like you remember me.

297
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,040
Sorry, I can't quite place you...

298
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,290
I helped out on several of the film club's projects.

299
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,080
But I remember you,
Mihara. You were a senior in college.

300
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,000
I always thought you were very charming.

301
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,790
Really? That's great to hear.

302
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,790
Well, you left a big impression on me, Shirasaki.

303
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,830
Because I heard a lot about you from Hayama.

304
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,670
Huh?

305
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,250
What was it again...?

306
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,460
Didn't you say something
when he got scouted by a modeling agency?

307
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,830
Hayama,

308
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,920
aren't you going to do any acting?

309
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,630
What is wrong with you?

310
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,080
I always remembered it.
You said something incredibly rude.

311
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,040
I'm so sorry.

312
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,420
Mihara.

313
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,170
Could you please stop teasing him?

314
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,330
Because...

315
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
I can't help but tease people I find cute.

316
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,880
Let's get along from now on.

317
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,380
Okay.

318
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,750
What about me?

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,880
We're past that, aren't we?

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,210
All right...

321
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,920
Shirasaki, so this is where you wanted to come.

322
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,380
Yes.

323
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,170
I heard it was really beautiful here,

324
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,790
so I wanted to see it with you, Asami-san.

325
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,250
I'm looking forward to it.

326
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,880
Yeah.

327
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,460
Is this spot okay?

328
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,000
It's starting.

329
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,630
Today is October 11th.

330
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,750
Sunset today is at 5:11 p.m.

331
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,330
Now, let's gently fast-forward time

332
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,290
and wait for night to fall.

333
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,710
The winter constellations begin to appear.

334
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,000
If you look up just a bit at the eastern sky,

335
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,080
you can see three stars lined up in a row.

336
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,790
Surrounding them are four bright stars.

337
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,330
This is the signature constellation of winter:

338
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,830
Orion.

339
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,290
The one that looks especially bright

340
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,750
is the red star on the left, Betelgeuse,

341
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,710
and the white star on the right...

342
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,290
That was beautiful.

343
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,710
It was.

344
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,790
It felt like the stars were
going to pour down on us.

345
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,670
I was so moved.

346
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,960
Speaking of which,
I haven't come to the planetarium for...

347
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,710
I lost count on how many years.

348
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,330
Yeah.

349
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,830
This is probably my first time since elementary school.

350
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,540
I think it is for me, too.

351
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,130
I think I went to one when I was in the UK.

352
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,710
Oh?

353
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,380
Asami-san, you lived in the UK?

354
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah.

355
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,580
Because of my dad's work.

356
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,000
I lived there when I was in elementary school.

357
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,330
I see.

358
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,080
So that's why you like black tea so much.

359
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,750
Maybe so.

360
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,630
By the way.

361
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,670
Asami-san, Your father...

362
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,920
He's working over there.

363
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,290
I see.

364
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,790
He works at a university.

365
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,790
Oh?

366
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,540
And he also writes novels.

367
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,210
A novelist?

368
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,210
That's amazing.

369
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,630
So, Asami-san...

370
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,500
you didn't choose to stay in the UK?

371
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,500
No.

372
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,630
My mother's health declined,

373
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,920
so we came back to Japan.

374
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,460
My father left us

375
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,040
and went back to the UK alone.

376
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,460
Oh.

377
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,790
Now, my father's novel

378
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,460
is being adapted into a film at a studio in the UK.

379
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,420
Really?

380
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,000
It's an autobiographical novel,

381
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,170
and he wants me to play the lead.

382
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,790
Produced by an overseas studio.

383
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,830
Isn't that incredible?

384
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,670
Yeah.

385
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,420
Asami-san?

386
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,080
(This is a work of fiction.)

387
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,670
(Next Episode)
Are you going to star in your dad's movie?

388
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,920
Pouring out your own feelings.

389
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,580
What does that even mean?

390
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,710
Asami-san, I feel like

391
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,750
you're just looking for excuses not to take the part.

392
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,330
That's not true.

393
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,420
Who are you acting for?
