00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,500
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 10)

2
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,000
Ah, excuse me.

3
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,750
Have you seen Mitarai?

4
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,460
No, forget that. Look at this.

5
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,130
What?

6
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,790
The post office was robbed again.

7
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,670
That's terrifying...

8
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,540
Never mind that, have you seen Mitarai?

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,920
I can't find him anywhere.

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,920
- Just leave him be.
- Where on earth did he go?

11
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,420
Ah, there he is...

12
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,670
- That's my line.
- Good work.

13
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,750
Hey, Muroga.

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
What is it?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,790
I got a nice bottle of booze. Want to have a drink?

16
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,580
You're just planning to crash
at my place again, aren't you?

17
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,750
Is this even the right place?

18
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,170
Hey, the call isn't going through.
What's going on?

19
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,000
Is no one here?

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,500
Aren't you going to see Mitarai today?

21
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,000
What the hell? This place is in the middle of nowhere.

22
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,670
I'll go in a bit.

23
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,000
Hello, are you from the guesthouse?

24
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,880
No, I'm not.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm the head of this village. My name is Goto.

26
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,960
Village Head, hello. I'm Fukuyama.

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,250
I loathed him.

28
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,710
I envied him.

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,540
I even wanted to kill him.

30
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,420
No, that's not what I thought.

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,670
You're not gentle at all.

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,460
You're actually a cunning,
cold, and despicable man.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,670
That's why you killed Muroga
and took his place, isn't it?

34
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,040
You too?

35
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,670
Are you also here to get in my way?

36
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,500
Nakamura Yusaku.

37
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,960
That's my real name.

38
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,880
Until now, I've blamed others
for everything I've done.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,460
But that's not true.

40
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,460
Everything was my own fault.

41
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,880
He said, "You'll never amount to anything."

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,710
Those words have haunted me ever since.

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,250
Waiting for the moment I'd fall into hell.

44
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,750
That's right. I'm just an imposter.

45
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,380
No matter who I replaced,
no matter how many times I killed...

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,130
I could only ever be myself.

47
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,040
These hands, struggling for an ideal...

48
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,790
They grasp at nothing but emptiness.

49
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,170
All that's left is...

50
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,420
the feeling of tainted blood.

51
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,380
And the deeply seared memory of my sins.

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,420
I hate...

53
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,630
this life of being unloved by anyone,
of constantly running away.

54
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Mitarai...

55
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,500
If somewhere out there,
there exists a different world...

56
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,920
I hope we could have been good friends there.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,830
Your real name...

58
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,670
Is it Nakamura Yusaku?

59
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,380
It's a good name.

60
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,290
Why...?

61
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,670
I followed you.

63
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,290
I understand everything now.

64
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,210
Why you came here, and the truth behind the incident.

65
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,330
And why you haven't been yourself lately.
I understand it all.

66
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:03,210
The man you liked... the one named Muroga...

67
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,750
He doesn't exist in this world.

68
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,630
No, you're right here.

69
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm not here at all.

70
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes, you are.

71
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,170
You've always been here, haven't you?

72
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,330
No matter who you are,

73
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,920
you're still my good friend.

74
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,960
No, that's not what I thought.

75
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,330
No.

76
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,290
I don't want to lose to Asami-san.

77
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,210
We've become true rivals, haven't we?

78
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,750
Yes.

79
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,960
I dropped out.

80
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,000
I... was chosen.

81
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,920
Congratulations.

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,630
If this keeps up, he might steal the role from me.

83
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,830
I really like your acting.

84
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,540
Who are you acting for?

85
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,960
Good work, you two.

86
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Sakuma, your performance as a scumbag was incredible today.

87
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,460
A scumbag?

88
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,420
- It was intense.
- Hey, that's no way to put it.

89
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,750
It's just acting.

90
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,960
I know that.

91
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,630
I meant it was a great performance.

92
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,170
Wait, do you really think so?

93
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,880
- I do.
- Really?

94
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
- It doesn't look like it.
- I do!

95
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,250
Yamase... You don't really mean that.

96
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,210
- I do!
- Really?

97
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,210
Haven't I been saying that this whole time?

98
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,750
Anyway, uh...

99
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,210
There's no show tomorrow.
Want to go for a couple of drinks?

100
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, I'm in.

101
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,380
Tomorrow's Shirasaki's birthday, right?

102
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,580
Let's celebrate.

103
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,960
Ah, well...

104
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,130
But today's a little...

105
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,330
Sakuma, let's just the two of us go today.

106
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:45,960
Huh?

107
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,960
It seems Yuki has plans.

108
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,380
- Oh, I see.
- How about it?

109
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,710
Well, let's celebrate some other time then.

110
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,920
See you some other time then.

112
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,130
I'm heading out. You two have fun.

113
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,170
Good work.

114
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,750
You too.

115
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,000
Sakuma, wait up.

116
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,080
Too close.

117
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,960
Let's go drinking.

118
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,500
Okay.

119
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,580
Um, Shirasaki...

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

121
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,210
The one who should have made the decision
was you, Asami-san.

122
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,330
And yet, I...

123
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,580
Me too.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,460
At the audition,
when I saw you play Muroga...

126
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,420
I thought to myself...

127
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,130
that perhaps you were better suited to play him.

128
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,250
Although...

129
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,960
I could have chosen to stay in the audition until the end.

130
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,130
But I didn't.

131
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,920
Back then...

132
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,460
I couldn't do it.

133
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,420
In the play today...

134
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,040
your portrayal of Muroga was truly wonderful.

135
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,880
Actually...

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,960
I've always loved your acting, Asami-san.

137
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,210
That's why I want you, Asami-san...

138
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,380
to do what you truly want to do.

139
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,920
Today...

140
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,670
after watching your performance, Shirasaki...

141
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,170
as an actor...

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,580
I don't want to lose to you.

143
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,460
I'll take it. That movie.

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,460
Then, I'm going to England.

145
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,830
Yeah.

146
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,380
Yeah.

147
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,080
Whoa, what is this place? It's incredible.

148
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,130
I feel like a celebrity.

149
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,580
When did you book this place?

150
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,540
Hmm... a long time ago.

151
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,630
I had no idea.

152
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,210
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

153
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,920
Then, when you're done filming, Asami-san...

154
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,920
I'll be the one to surprise you.

155
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,290
Huh?

156
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,540
You're going to surprise me?

157
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,130
That's right. You'd better look forward to it.

158
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,920
I will.

159
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,210
Yeah.

160
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,960
What should I prepare?

161
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,670
Let me think...

162
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,210
How about something like this?

163
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,210
But that would be repetitive.

164
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,830
Or maybe the two of us could...

165
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,210
Thank you.

166
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,040
Thank you for coming into my life.

167
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,790
That's my line.

168
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,630
What was that?

169
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,920
The smell of the ocean.

170
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,630
Yeah.

171
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,380
Somehow...

172
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,460
it reminds me a little of the sea back home.

173
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
England...

174
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,960
It's so far away.

175
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,330
Yeah.

176
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,210
We're... going to be apart for a while.

177
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,630
Yeah.

178
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,710
Asami-san.

179
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,750
If anything sad happens while you're there...

180
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,580
please tell me anytime.

181
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,880
You've always been the one helping me, Asami-san.

182
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,630
This time, it's my turn to support you.

183
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,710
Though I don't know if I can do it
as well as you do.

184
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,460
Thank you.

185
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,920
Here.

186
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,040
A birthday present.

187
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,960
Happy birthday.

188
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,790
Thank you.

189
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,040
Can I open it?

190
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,500
Yeah.

191
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,920
Huh, cologne?

192
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,000
You don't wear accessories, do you, Shirasaki?

193
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,880
Right.

194
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,750
So I got you this instead.

195
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,420
Wow, this is great. It's so cool.

196
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,130
I thought it would suit you.

197
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,420
Is this how you see me,
Asami-san?

198
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,540
What about this one?

199
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,670
This is your scent, Asami-san.

200
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,630
Since we're going to be apart for a while...

201
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,040
I wanted to give you something
you could always have with you.

202
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,670
I'm so happy.

203
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,210
I'll cherish it.

204
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,920
You know...

205
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,710
I have a dream.

206
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,540
Yeah?

207
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,420
My dream is...

208
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,420
to act with you again.

209
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,130
That's my dream.

210
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,210
Me too...

211
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,380

(The End)

212
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,580
("At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2 Daytime Dream Another Side)
Delivery.

213
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,420
Yamato.

214
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,830
("A Daydream" Spin-off)
Here, it's ready.

215
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
You don't have to force a smile for me.

216
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,580
(Another love story intertwined between them.)
My heart aches when I'm with you.

217
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,330
It's been this way since the day
you made a delivery to my company.

218
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,420
If you tell me this is a joke, I'll kill you.

219
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,630
I'm in love with you.
