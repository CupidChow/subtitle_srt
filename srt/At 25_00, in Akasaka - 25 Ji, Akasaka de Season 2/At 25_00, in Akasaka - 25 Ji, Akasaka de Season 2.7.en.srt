1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,540
You...

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,210
You...

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,130
What do you...

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,130
- You...
- What do you know about me?

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,580
I didn't do anything.

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,790
I never thought
about stealing the lead role from him.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,000
And I wasn't confident I could take him down.

8
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,380
It's just that...

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,210
In this world,
you can't survive on luck alone.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,210
He didn't have...

11
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,250
the talent.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,540
Kuroki.

13
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,290
The lead role is yours.

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm counting on you.

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,540
I...

16
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,040
Shirasaki.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,630
There's no place for you here.

18
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,460
What do you know about me?

19
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,500
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 7)

20
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,250
I told you, nothing's wrong.

21
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,500
Don't lie to me.

22
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,670
We've been together for two years.

23
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,920
I know you.

24
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,460
What do you know about me?

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,250
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,380
you haven't seemed right.

27
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,040
Something must have happened, right?

28
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,330
Well...

29
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,210
I didn't do anything.

30
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,790
- Do you believe...
- Sorry, let's take a break.

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,210
Okay.

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,880
Shirasaki.

33
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,420
Are you feeling unwell?

34
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,790
Huh?

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm fine.

36
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,040
Okay.

37
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,790
You can go home for the day.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,330
Pushing yourself won't do you any good.

39
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,460
- Kuroki.
- Yes?

40
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,750
Excuse me.

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,460
Can you play Muroga's part again?

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,670
Of course.

43
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,130
I can do it. I can, Aoyama-san.

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,580
Wait, Shirasaki.

45
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,500
If you're going to stay,

46
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,420
just sit and watch.

47
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,710
So,

48
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,380
So you always saw him as a threat.

49
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:21,583
You're sick of him, but you also envy him.

50
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,667
You even want him dead.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,500
No, I never thought that.

52
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,170
You're not gentle at all.

53
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,290
You're actually a cunning, cold,
and despicable person.

54
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,790
That's why...

55
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,210
you killed Muroga and took his place, didn't you?

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,210
You too?

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,920
Are you also here to get in my way?

58
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,040
If that's the case...

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,880
Lights dim.

60
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,670
Okay, thank you both.

61
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,920
Thank...

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

63
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,830
- Muroga.
- Yes?

64
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,130
- That was powerful, nice work.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,330
- Fukuyama.
- Yes?

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,790
You need to let go more.

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,420
Let go more?

68
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,000
- Let go more.
- Yes.

69
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,250
You seemed pretty despicable just now,

70
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,880
but you can be even more so.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
The way you grab him
looks a little dangerous.

72
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,920
You two need to work on syncing up.

73
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,500
- I understand.
- Keep at it.

74
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,960
Next, for Mitarai's part...

75
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,790
Also...

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,080
Director Imai sent over the revised script
for the climax.

77
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,710
Hold on, I'll go print it.

78
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,750
Thank you.

79
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,540
Hello?

80
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,880
Asami?

81
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,670
Mom.

82
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,540
You haven't been back home.

83
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,420
Are you doing okay?

84
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,330
Sorry.

85
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,250
I've been too busy.

86
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,460
I see.

87
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,790
What's up?

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,500
A package arrived for you.

89
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,170
A package?

90
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,920
Who's it from?

91
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,250
It's from your father.

92
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,790
Huh?

93
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,750
"I want to play the lead in 'Rain and Confession'."

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,380
You know... there's a novel I love
called 'Rain and Confession.'

95
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,710
I was fascinated by the main character.

96
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm home.

97
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,130
You're early today.

98
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,290
Welcome back.

99
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,000
This...

100
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,250
I saw it.

101
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,500
Why didn't you tell me?

102
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,710
You really wanted to play the role of Muroga, didn't you?

103
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,960
Sorry.

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,290
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

105
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,330
Shirasaki?

106
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,580
Asami-san.

107
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,540
Please, snap me out of it.

108
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,790
- Huh?
- Please...

109
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,790
Snap me out of it.

110
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,460
- Snap you...
- Snap me out of it.

111
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,420
Why?

112
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't ask questions. Just slap me.

113
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,500
What?

114
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm not going to do something so violent.

115
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't worry, I won't sue you.

116
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,000
Is that the point?

117
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,750
If you don't,

118
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,630
I'm going to fall apart.

119
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,830
I feel so pathetic.

120
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,250
So useless. I hate this version of myself.

121
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,290
Come on, please.

122
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,790
Well, if you insist.

123
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,000
Here I come.

124
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,920
Go ahead.

125
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,630
Mmm.

126

Shirasaki.

Have you lost weight?

128
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,420
Um...

129
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,080
That didn't snap me out of it at all.

130
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,920
Because I didn't want to hit you.

131
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
But I said it was okay.

132
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,330
Well then...

133
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,130
If I told you to hit me, would you?

134
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,290
- No.
- Exactly.

135
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,420
Come here.

136
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,580
Sit down.

137
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,380
Did something happen at rehearsal?

138
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,290
Can't you tell me?

139
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,420
Because...

140
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,670
It's true.

141
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,330
I've always wanted to play Muroga.

142
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,830
But...

143
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,210
I now feel just as strongly

144
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,330
about wanting to see you play the role of Muroga.

145
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,670
I'm trying my best to play him,

146
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,500
but I'm just not getting it right.

147
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,670
Things like vocalization,

148
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,130
being conscious of the audience,
and interpreting the lines.

149
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,540
I've been thinking about all of it,

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,630
but it's still not working at all.

151
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,960
Today, too.

152
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,290
They wouldn't even let me finish my lines.

153
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,670
There's an actor in the cast named Kuroki.

154
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,460
If this keeps up, he might take the role from me.

155
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,290
Do you remember?

156
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,000
Back in college,

157
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,420
you played a criminal once, right?

158
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,380
Huh?

159
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah.

160
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,040
Back then...

161
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,290
it was the first time I saw you act.

162
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,130
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

Thank you.

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,040
Did that actually help?

171
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,630
It helped a lot.

172
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,000
It helped?

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,210

and the character you're auditioning for, Takumi,

190
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,210
have in common?

191
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,170
Takumi is a very straightforward person.

192
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,580
His feelings for Ryoji
are stronger than anyone else's.

193
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,170
I feel that Takumi's straightforward personality
is very similar to my own.

194
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,330
Then, Kuroki-san,

195
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,000
is there anything about you
that you'd "never lose to anyone" in?

196
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,880
The passion I pour into my acting.

197
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,880
That feeling of "I have to play Takumi, no matter what".

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,580
I won't lose to anyone in that.

199
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,960
- Good work.
- You too.

200
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,380
(Daydream)

201
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,170
Shirasaki Yuki.

202
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,000
(Rehearsal for the play "Rain and Confession")

203
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,960
What do you know about me?

204
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,710
Good morning.

205
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,960
You're here early.

206
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,000
Are you feeling better?

207
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,130
Um...

208
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,460
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

209
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,040
Don't worry about it.

210
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,830
I was actually fine with things staying as they were.

211
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,330
Aoyama-san said it too.

212
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,580
Nothing good comes from forcing it.

213
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,000
Maybe it's better if they just recast the role.

214
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:38,830
What is it?

215
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,130
Please, give me some advice.

216
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,130
What?

217
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,460
Kuroki-san, you were great as Muroga.

218
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,170
It's frustrating to admit...

219
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,750
but you were really amazing.

220
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,290
I don't have much experience on stage.

221
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,630
I was hoping you could tell me
what I'm missing.

222
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,670
Why don't you just ask Aoyama-san?

223
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,790
I will, of course, but...

224
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,210
As far as acting goes,
you're the one I've worked with the most, Kuroki-san.

225
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,460
That's why I want to ask you.

226
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,630
Please.

227
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,710
Don't lie to me. We've been together for two years.

228
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,540
I know you.

229
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,130
What do you know about me?

230
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,170
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

231
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,630
you haven't seemed right.

232
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,540
Something definitely happened, didn't it?

233
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,790
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.

234
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,420
Please, just believe me.

235
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,670
Well?

236
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,630
Hmm.

237
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,000
When you're performing...

238
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,920
what's on your mind?

239
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,000
Are you too worried about what Aoyama-san thinks?

240
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,170
Or are you just hung up on
the idea of "I have to nail this"?

241
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,830
Maybe...

242
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,670
Sorry.

243
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,130
Look, like I said...

244
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,630
I seriously don't mind if they recast me.

245
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,080
No.

246
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,210
It's just...

247
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,750
I love your acting, Kuroki-san.

248
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,210
But this role...

249
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,920
the role of Muroga...

250
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,880
I want to be the one to play him.

251
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,920
I love Ryoji-san.

252
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
Yeah.

253
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,130
I get it.

254
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,670
Huh?

255
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,790
No matter how much you admire someone's acting,

256
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,460
it still sucks when a role you want
gets taken away from you.

257
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,420
What is it?

258
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,330
What?

259
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,540
I was just thinking
maybe Muroga feels the same way in this scene.

260
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,330
Go on.

261
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,790
So...

262
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,130
As his best friend, Muroga cares about Mitarai.

263
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,500
Right.

264
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,130
But...

265
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,170
he's being suspected of murder by that very friend.

266
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,920
If...

267
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,710
his past crimes are exposed...

268
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,170
and the peaceful life he finally managed
to build is stripped away...

269
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,790
he would be furious.

270
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,250
That's why.

271
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,630
He needs Mitarai to believe him, no matter what.

272
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,420
Because if he doesn't...

273
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,960
to hide his own crimes...

274
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,960
Muroga...

275
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,830
will have no choice but to kill his best friend.

276
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,420
I don't want to kill you.

277
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,130
So I need you to believe me.

278
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,130
Don't... make me kill you.

279
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,710
Let's run that scene again.

280
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,460
Okay.

281
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,670
I told you, it's nothing.

282
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,540
Don't lie to me.

283
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,460
We've been together for two years.

284
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,290
I know you.

285
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,710
What do you know about me?

286
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,750
Ever since that outsider disappeared,

287
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,170
you haven't been yourself.

288
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,250
Something happened, didn't it?

289
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,170
I told you I didn't do anything.

290
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,000
Please...

291
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,130
believe me.

292
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,830
Okay?

293
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,170
Brilliant!

294
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,460
Alright, Fukuyama, you're up.

295
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,040
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

296
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,040
Shirasaki.

297
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,880
I was worried about you.

298
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,080
Sorry.

299
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,040
That was a great performance.

300
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,040
Thank you.

301
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,000
Alright, from Act 6.

302
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,630
And so,

303
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,540
Kuroki-san has been helping me rehearse.

304
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,130
He's been helping you?

305
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,500
Yeah.

306
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,880
I see.

307
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,750
I'm glad everything worked out.

308
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,790
I have to thank you too, Asami-san.

309
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,580
For encouraging me.

310
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,500
Of course.

311
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,880
Shirasaki.

312
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,670
You don't have rehearsal tomorrow, do you?

313
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,460
- In that case, would you like to...
- Oh.

314
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,710
Huh?

315
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,380
It's Kuroki-san.

316
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,630
Sorry, do you mind if I take this?

317
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,920
We were just talking about
getting together for some extra practice tomorrow.

318
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,960
Is that so?

319
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,170
Yeah.

320
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Hello? Sorry, I was just eating.

321
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,750
Yeah.

322
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,290
So what time tomorrow?

323
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,170
Eight o'clock?

324
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,000
(Preview)
It's easy acting opposite Shirasaki.

325
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,000
It's only natural for actors to get close.

326
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,670
I was starting to wonder... Are you jealous?

327
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,880
Well, what do you expect when you're so close with Kuroki?

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,250
My father's novel...

329
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,670
is being adapted into a film by a studio in the UK.
