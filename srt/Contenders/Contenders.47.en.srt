3
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,710
Dad!

4
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,040
Rest in peace!

5
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
Uncle Jinhu,

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,600
rest in peace!

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
Jinhu

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,990
suffered his whole life.

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,310
Let's give him a proper farewell.

10
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,710
Don't worry, Boss.

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,310
We'll handle everything.

12
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,920
Our brotherhood lasts forever.

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
Brother,

14
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,710
see you next life!

15
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,590
- Brother,
- Dad,

16
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,240
- see you next life!
- see you next life!

17
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,630
James ordered us

18
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,200
to capture Zheng Qiu,

19
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,120
and he'll be supervising this.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,990
I thought

21
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,310
James was his

22
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,550
accomplice.

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,270
It turns out I was wrong.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,310
It seems James is harder

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,830
to deal with.

26
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,590
Remember this,

27
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,270
be careful with him.

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,430
Sir,

29
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,480
do you mean

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,680
James hid

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,710
Zheng Qiu?

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
No.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,590
If they're on the same side,

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,760
at this point,

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,360
James will shut his mouth for good.

36
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,400
The Lion City Police's reputation

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,750
was ruined by Zheng Qiu.

38
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,280
He's extremely

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
cunning.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
No matter what happens,

41
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,160
as soon as you spot him,

42
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,720
take him down immediately.

43
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,730
Yes, sir!

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
Ask James to help us

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,030
leave Lion City.

46
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,680
We can't rely on
that fake foreigner anymore.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,760
We...

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,670
- What should we...
- Why are you afraid?

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,760
Long Shiqi,

50
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,400
you killed Cheng Hui's wife back then.

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,760
(Long Shiqi)
It's been over 20 years.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Has anyone ever caught you?

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
No.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,870
I can

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,830
not only keep you safe

56
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,150
but make sure you have good food,

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,280
a lot of money,

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,310
and pretty women.

59
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,240
Have I ever let you down?

60
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,480
Never.

61
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,400
I won't surrender.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,080
The Zheng family has always been

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
the most powerful family.

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,080
I can't give up.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,680
(The city's pulse
beats with traffic and people.)

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,270
(From the pier to Chinatown,)

67
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,750
(every street and building)

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,430
(tells the story)

69
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,120
(of the hard-working Chinese community)

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,560
(and the moving tales)

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,750
(of Mazu and the Red Headscarf.)

72
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,950
(Now, the new generation,
represented by Liu Zhendong,)

73
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,750
(is carrying on the elders' dreams)

74
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,630
(in their own way,)

75
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,380
(Wilson, Governor of Lion City)
(striving to)

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,040
(eradicate the evil forces in the city.)

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,120
(From builders to guardians,)

78
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,330
(the times have changed their mission,)

79
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,600
(but)

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
(their true hearts)

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,510
(have remained the same.)

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,680
Peter,

83
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,480
you've convinced me.

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,190
Draw up a plan

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,430
based on your suggestion
as soon as possible.

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,310
If it benefits Lion City,

87
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,550
I'll support it.

88
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,600
I appreciate it, Governor.

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,200
Thank you, Mom.

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
Son,

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,560
what's wrong?

92
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,710
Mom,

93
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,070
I once swore

94
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,630
to protect Shanhai Gang with my life.

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,880
But today,

96
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,510
I'm the one erasing it

97
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,950
from Lion City.

98
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,720
Don't flatter yourself.

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,720
Shanhai Gang can be disbanded,

100
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,550
but no one

101
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,550
can wipe its existence from Lion City.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
What Cheng Hui said that day

103
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,160
resonates with the people.

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,840
Shanhai Gang's soul

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,720
will always remain.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
People may pass away,

107
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,840
but the soul lives on.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,070
A Shanhai Man for a day,

109
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,950
a Shanhai Soul for life.

110
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,150
You're right, Mom.

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
Zhendong,

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,640
why not light incense?

113
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm waiting for you.

114
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
It's just my initial thought.

115
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,510
Uncle,

116
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,600
if you don't agree...

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,560
I agree.

118
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,930
Shanhai Company

119
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,630
is finally on track now,

120
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,700
and we've got the governor's approval.

121
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,870
I should be happy about it.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
Hand over the weapons,

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,430
disband Shanhai Gang,

124
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,710
and promise

125
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,950
not to organize any activities

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,160
as a gang anymore.

127
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,510
No problem.

128
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,240
Even though I won't admit

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,990
Shanhai Gang is a criminal group,

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,160
some people always believe

131
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,160
that we're criminals.

132
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,510
I'm happy

133
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,190
with the outcome.

134
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Zhendong,

135
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,990
I should thank you.

136
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,040
We're lucky

137
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,630
to have someone like you.

138
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,270
Uncle,

139
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
you sent me to Europe

140
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,630
and made me a cop

141
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,920
because you knew
this would happen, right?

142
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,000
If I say I never thought

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
about it, that'd be a lie.

144
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,790
Of course I did.

145
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,990
Maybe I'm old,

146
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,670
but I'm not stupid.

147
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,840
Back then,

148
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
your dad and I

149
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,750
came here in our 20s

150
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,550
to make a living.

151
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,510
It's been over 30 years,

152
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,990
and now I've become

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,840
a real local.

154
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,000
For the city's development,

155
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm willing to do anything.

156
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,510
This is so exciting, Zhendong.

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,630
You've done something huge
for Lion City.

158
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,990
But do you know

159
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,670
what my favorite saying

160
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,630
has been?

161
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,320
Born a Shanhai Man,

162
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,840
die a Shanhai Soul.

163
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,510
Yes.

164
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Since I was little,

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,790
I've been proud of

166
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,630
being a Shanhai Man.

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Back then,

168
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,240
I wanted to lead our brothers

169
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,670
to dominate

170
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,920
Lion City.

171
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,790
Such things

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,630
can only appear in my dreams now.

173
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,910
And photos.

174
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,720
Are you mocking me?

175
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,790
I mean it.

176
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,000
I think the story of Shanhai Gang

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,120
will be a good novel.

178
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,080
People will like it.

179
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,990
A novel?

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,910
Good idea.

181
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,440
I need to consider this.

182
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,990
You should

183
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,000
give your son

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,990
a proper name first.

185
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,240
That day,

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,910
I met Mrs. Liu in the hospital.

187
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,150
She said you hadn't named

188
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,110
your son.

189
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,200
It's not that easy.

190
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,840
You're a reporter.

191
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,720
Writing is your thing.

192
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,550
How about you name him for me?

193
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,240
What kind of dad are you?

194
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Well,

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,150
this is way too hard.

196
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,630
I really can't think of one.

197
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,240
(Filial Piety)

198
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
Didn't expect the government

199
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,480
would offer such a good deal.

200
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,990
It's way better than I thought.

201
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,910
Rather than wiping us out,

202
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,630
they asked us to disband the gang.

203
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,760
It's quite a good deal.

204
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,870
Good deal?

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,020
Seriously?

206
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,870
If Boss hadn't suggested this,

207
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,940
I would've flipped the table!

208
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,280
Sit down.

209
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,710
Boss.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
This isn't

211
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,240
the only thing
you want to talk about, right?

212
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
What's wrong?

213
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,240
This big meal feels strange.

214
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,790
How?

215
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,550
You asked Kuan,

216
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,440
Fuhai,

217
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,030
and Guangrong to leave

218
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
before talking about serious stuff.

219
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,830
Honestly,

220
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
since Heihu

221
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
became the gang leader,

222
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,360
he's become way smarter.

223
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,560
Zhao, don't you agree?

224
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,920
You're right.

225
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,880
Zhao Tiehan.

226
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,660
You schemed again, didn't you?

227
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,110
You kept it from us.

228
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,350
Sheyan,

229
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,510
I'm the strategist.

230
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,510
It's my duty

231
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
to give Boss advice.

232
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,800
But this time,

233
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,560
I didn't suggest anything.

234
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,750
Enough.

235
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,990
Don't blame him.

236
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,050
I might put you at risk

237
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,670
by letting you stay.

238
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,780
(Shanhai Is Our Home,
Peace and Prosperity)

239
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,240
All gangs shall hand over their weapons

240
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,440
and be disbanded.

241
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,240
Cheng Hui from Shanhai Gang

242
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,630
takes the lead to support this decision.

243
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,030
Reporter...

244
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,240
Who told you to read ahead?

245
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,320
Sorry, I forgot.

246
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,790
I'll read these two lines.

247
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,550
All gangs shall hand over their weapons

248
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,560
and be disbanded.

249
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,270
Cheng Hui from Shanhai Gang
takes the lead to support this decision.

250
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,750
All gangs shall hand over
their weapons...

251
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,800
Stop.

252
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,710
Do you think

253
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Cheng Hui

254
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,990
will really disband Shanhai Gang?

255
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,390
The paper says

256
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,350
he will.

257
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,960
Now that the gang is disbanded,

258
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,270
and they have no weapons,

259
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,720
it's finally

260
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,240
my turn to get revenge.

261
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,000
You mean you want to

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
get revenge on Master Cheng?

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
What an idiot.

264
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,600
You're so stupid.

265
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,030
When can you become

266
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,320
a capable

267
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,030
second-in-command

268
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,790
like Heihu and Sheyan?

269
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,240
Even if Cheng Hui

270
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,750
handed over all the weapons,

271
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,150
even if he got ten years older,

272
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,600
I'd still run if I saw him.

273
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
He's not an ordinary person.

274
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,120
Otherwise,

275
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,960
why would I hide all these years?

276
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,440
But you said revenge...

277
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,030
I mean

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,080
let's start with

279
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,670
someone easier to handle,

280
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,510
like Widow Chen.

281
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,990
With Shanhai Gang's protection,

282
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,910
I can't even touch her back.

283
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Also,

284
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,750
Lin has been selling chicken rice

285
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,600
on my turf

286
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,720
for decades,

287
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,320
but he's never paid protection money.

288
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
But now,

289
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,990
I can get it all back

290
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,960
from them.

291
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
Fish is coming.

292
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,960
Why are you so quiet?

293
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Read it again.

294
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
Read it a hundred times.

295
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,360
All gangs shall hand over their weapons

296
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,480
and be disbanded.

297
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,150
Boss, will you take me in?

298
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,390
You can stay with us.

299
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,440
Shanhai Gang
has handed over the weapons.

300
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,510
This is

301
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,870
our best chance.

302
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,790
We've been bullied for years.

303
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,790
Now it's time they pay the price!

304
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,040
Boss,

305
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,910
are you really gonna trust this guy?

306
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,120
They say he's loyal to Cheng Hui.

307
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,080
It doesn't matter.

308
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
Boss is simply using him.

309
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
Once Shanhai Gang is gone,

310
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,440
he'll be slaughtered like a dog.

311
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,920
Wonderful.

312
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I like hearing you speak English.

313
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
From now on,

314
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,110
you're

315
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,600
my

316
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,320
boss.

317
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,440
You weren't even born

318
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,200
when I learned English.

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,990
Put your gun down!

320
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,350
Don't move,

321
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,770
or I'll blow you up!

322
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
Step back!

323
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,910
Drop your weapons!

324
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,320
If you move, you'll get blown up!

325
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,530
- Drop them!
- Remember,

326
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
you're not gangsters anymore.

327
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,750
Don't you dare bully the neighbors!

328
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Let's go!

329
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,630
Do you know?

330
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,910
The price of trafficking people

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,030
is going up

332
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,320
because fewer can be sold.

333
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,200
The male went up 30 percent,

334
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,560
and for women, 50 percent.

335
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,330
The more beautiful ones
are even more expensive.

336
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,440
Master Cheng!

337
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,390
You're still so devoted, right?

338
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,120
Yes.

339
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
My heart is with Buddha.

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
All my life,

341
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,630
I've never dared do wrong.

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,480
Then why are you afraid of me?

343
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,560
No.

344
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,120
It's been years since we met.

345
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,600
Why didn't you tell me

346
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,960
you were coming?

347
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,600
You left Shanhai Gang

348
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,040
11 years ago, right?

349
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,130
Yes.

350
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
You still remember that?

351
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,910
11 years ago,

352
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,630
Qiu Jian, the former leader
of Weiyuan Hall,

353
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,030
was poisoned.

354
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,240
His family,

355
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,510
old and young,

356
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,910
eight people in total,

357
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,990
all died.

358
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,710
How could I ever forget

359
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,010
something like this?

360
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,350
Yes.

361
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
I can't forget it either.

362
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,690
That's why I feel heartbroken.

363
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,080
I often sit before the Buddha

364
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,200
and pray,

365
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,630
hoping Hall Leader Qiu Jian

366
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,360
and his family can rest in peace.

367
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,240
Amitabha Buddha.

368
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,870
I believe you.

369
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,120
I was passing by

370
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,750
and got a bit thirsty,

371
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,720
so I came for a cup of tea.

372
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Sure.

373
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,710
Here.

374
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,790
Thank you.

375
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,310
I almost forgot.

376
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,550
We

377
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,080
hired a deputy treasurer

378
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,190
named Xu Guangrong.

379
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,270
He studied medicine.

380
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,200
He told me

381
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,520
to be careful

382
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,950
with food and drinks.

383
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,900
He also gave me

384
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,960
a medicine

385
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,200
that can test

386
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,160
if there's

387
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,150
poison.

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,190
Master Cheng, don't drink it!

389
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm so sorry!

390
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Master Cheng.

391
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,840
I used to be

392
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,920
part of

393
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
Shanhai Gang,

394
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,670
so please have mercy.

395
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,840
So, it's really poisoned.

396
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
Well, I...

397
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,130
- I...
- I only put

398
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,600
a headache pill in it.

399
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,430
It can't detect any poison.

400
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,840
If you didn't tell,

401
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,390
no one would ever know.

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
Master Cheng, mercy!

403
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,640
Mercy, Master Cheng!

404
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,590
Even if I had mercy,

405
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,520
would the eight spirits
of Qiujian's family

406
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,320
ever forgive you?

407
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,670
It wasn't me!

408
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,990
I...

409
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,880
It was me,

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,920
but I lost my mind.

411
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,600
Zheng Qiu tricked me too!

412
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,520
You're finally telling the truth.

413
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,270
Please don't kill me.

414
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,600
I don't want to die!

415
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,320
Your knife is so fast.

416
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,470
I didn't bring my knife.

417
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,820
You made that tea,

418
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,430
so drink it yourself.

419
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,150
I can promise

420
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,800
not to hurt your family

421
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,680
and keep

422
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,230
the 11-year secret

423
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,950
so that other brothers

424
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,040
won't get back at your family.

425
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,600
Karma has finally found me.

426
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,790
Master Cheng,

427
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,910
thank you

428
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,800
for giving me 11 more years.
