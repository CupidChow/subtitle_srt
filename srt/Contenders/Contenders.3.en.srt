00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,420
(SINGA DAILY)

4
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,590
My pleasure.

5
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,180
- Ms. Cheng.
- Hi, Jason.

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,620
Uncle Zheng.

7
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,900
The chief editor said someone came.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,100
Didn't expect it to be you.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,010
Take a walk with me, okay?

10
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,620
Your eyes look swollen.

11
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,590
What happened?

12
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,850
Did you cry because of Xiongwu?

13
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,890
You left Lion City at seven.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,460
So, your bond with Xiongwu

15
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,460
shouldn't be that deep, right?

16
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,060
(Cheng Nanping, Cheng Hui's Daughter)
I call him Uncle,

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,380
and he was the first person I met

18
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,380
after I came back.

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,730
But I understand.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,500
Gang leaders like them

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,500
always end up like this.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
Like them?

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,150
Who else?

24
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,090
Your dad?

25
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,730
You've been back for a year, right?

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,750
It's been a year
since I joined the press.

27
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,220
My leader even gave me a cake.

28
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,660
You met Xiongwu,

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,270
so your dad must know

30
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,490
you're back.

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,370
Did he write to you?

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,620
No.

33
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,260
What kind of dad is he?

34
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,450
Forget about him.

35
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,870
But Zhongxin

36
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,050
sent me some green curry.

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,220
The flavor is really unique.

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,730
It tastes quite different.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,850
Let me try it next time.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,630
But...

42
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,820
I'm not good at cooking.

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,560
I like

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,500
anything you cook.

45
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,100
Actually, you know

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,100
your dad and I are close friends.

47
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,950
I really don't want to see him

48
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,930
go astray.

49
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,580
As for Jin Yaju's case two years ago,

50
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,020
I don't think he did it,

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,700
but he still ran away.

52
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,700
It's my fault.

53
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,820
I should've persuaded him.

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,730
I feel guilty for your mom.

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,340
Grandpa told me

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,290
my mom was once
a servant at your house.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,020
If it weren't for you,

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,460
she wouldn't have had a chance to study.

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,610
Don't say servant.

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,100
Zhen is also my family.

61
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,800
I really regret it.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
I should've stopped her

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,850
from marrying your dad.

64
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,970
Otherwise, she wouldn't have...

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,340
I think your dad is back.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,780
If you see him, tell him

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,610
I want to have a proper talk with him.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,980
Let's go.

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,830
Cheng Hui, that cunning fox,

70
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,050
is back.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,290
Are you sure?

72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,370
I've dealt with him

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,820
for 30 years.

74
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,050
I can sense him when he's near.

75
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,600
Cheng Nanping said

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,340
she once ate green curry.

77
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,580
You should know

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,780
that it's a common dish
for the Qingmai people.

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,290
Cheng Hui was hiding there.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,870
I asked you to send someone

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,740
to look for him in Qingmai.

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,780
But you couldn't find him.

83
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,970
Now he's back unscathed.

84
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,890
How do you explain this?

85
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,500
(Chapon, Killer from Xiangfu)

86
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,310
My people failed.

87
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,830
I'll definitely kill Cheng Hui

88
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,260
in Lion City.

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,260
This is the weapon, boss.

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,970
Back at the teahouse,

91
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,510
someone used it to frame me

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,850
for killing Jin Yaju.

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,820
I'm sure

94
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,580
it was done by the same person.

95
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,580
(Da De Xing Teahouse, Xi Da Restaurant)

96
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,130
Dad.

97
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,530
Let's wait a little longer.

98
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,920
Our people from Weiyuan Hall

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,860
will be here soon.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,460
Why did you ask them to come?

101
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,410
Shanding Gang
has held a grudge against us.

102
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,540
I'm worried...

103
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,410
I know Jin Yaju well.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,680
He wants to meet in private,

105
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,730
so it must be important.

106
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,340
I can use this opportunity

107
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,050
to fix things between us.

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,660
We can't keep fighting forever.

109
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,950
- Wait here.
- Dad!

110
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,100
(Da De Xing Teahouse, Xi Da Restaurant)

111
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,620
(Jin Yaju, Shanding Gang Leader)

112
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,690
Dad!

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,940
Stop!

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,070
Hands up!

115
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,120
Get out of the car!

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,140
Out of the car!

117
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,860
It's all my fault.

118
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,970
I should've listened to Zhongxin.

119
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,430
Those police officers

120
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,410
showed up so fast.

121
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,050
All I could do was honk to warn Dad.

122
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,410
Good thing you were here.

123
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,460
If it weren't for you,

124
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,880
I would've been executed

125
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,010
as a murderer.

126
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,100
Those police officers
colluded with the culprit

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,260
to set up Dad.

128
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,330
That's right.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,750
Xiongwu said the same thing.

130
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,690
Boss.

131
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,300
Are you sure this was

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,510
the knife that ended

133
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,450
Jin Yaju's life?

134
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,490
Exactly the same.

135
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,700
This person

136
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,970
has killed my people.

137
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,060
I searched the entire Manzhou,

138
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,500
from Yadajia to Sishui,

139
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,860
then from Mogu to Qingmai,

140
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,240
still no trace of him.

141
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,420
Now it seems

142
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,640
this killer

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
has been hiding in Lion City.

144
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,080
He even sneaked into

145
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,540
my warehouse to commit a crime

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,340
and tried to frame me.

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,580
I have to catch him to clear my name!

148
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,730
Catching the killer

149
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,340
isn't our top priority.

150
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
What do you mean?

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,250
Shanhai Gang must have a leader.

152
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,300
We all heard

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,420
what A'nan said today.

154
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,370
What leader?

155
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,250
Boss is back, right?

156
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,490
Xiongwu has always been
the second master.

157
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,820
Our boss ran away,

158
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,270
so he took over for two years.

159
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,370
Heihu.

160
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,970
That's not fair.

161
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,340
When I left the gang,

162
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,700
I handed over the position

163
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,220
to Xiongwu.

164
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,300
Now he's the official gang leader.

165
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,150
In the past two years,

166
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,460
he's done a good job.

167
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,480
Our gang hasn't fallen apart,

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,730
and it's grown stronger.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,150
I've already

170
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,540
stepped down.

171
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,940
How can I take it over again?

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,270
Boss.

173
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,850
You must stabilize the situation.

174
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,020
How?

175
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,210
Don't forget

176
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,650
I'm still on the run.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,420
I can't even show up in public.

178
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,890
The only reason I came back

179
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,490
is to bury Xiongwu.

180
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,970
But you put your heart into the gang...

181
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,960
Therefore,

182
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,910
we should find

183
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,220
someone better.

184
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,660
Liuliu,

185
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,020
let's not

186
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,250
talk about this today.

187
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,700
It's a disgrace to Shanhai Gang.

188
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,490
I don't think so, Young Master.

189
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,850
Eat something first.

190
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,600
Sorry, sir.

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,540
I made the same mistake.

192
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,010
Don't call me that.

193
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,610
I don't work for the westerners,

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,490
and I'm no longer a master.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,130
Just call me

196
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,450
Zhendong.

197
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,540
Okay.

198
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,090
Come on, Zhendong, eat something.

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,180
You haven't eaten all day.

200
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,460
How can we earn our glory back?

201
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,850
How can we

202
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,380
earn

203
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,820
the glory

204
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,580
of Shanhai Gang

205
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,940
back?

206
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,850
Liu Zhendong,

207
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,420
you're a policeman! You...

208
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,730
Now I'm off duty.

209
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,970
You caught me off guard.

210
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,340
Is that all you've got?

211
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,610
Just a lackey for the westerners.

212
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,370
What skills can I have?

213
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,340
You're still too young.

214
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,390
I'm the toughest one

215
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,330
in Shanding Gang.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,940
Oh, really?

217
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,460
I'm actually the worst

218
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,570
in Shanhai Gang.

219
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,540
Zhendong!

220
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,340
Officer Liu.

221
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,890
Are you happy now?

222
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,850
Please have mercy.

223
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,970
Tell me,

224
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,370
who sent you here to mess things up?

225
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,810
Steven

226
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,100
or Zheng Qiu?

227
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,970
No one ordered me.

228
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,540
As a leader,

229
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,540
if I don't show my strength,

230
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,940
how can I lead my brothers?

231
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,490
Nonsense!

232
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,690
Do you think

233
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,250
I don't know what you're capable of?

234
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,160
You knew the westerners

235
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,490
hated Shanhai Gang,

236
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,460
yet you helped him anyway.

237
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,850
We're all Chinese.

238
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,730
Tell me,

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,220
who sent you?

240
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,540
I can't.

241
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,820
They'll kill me!

242
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,540
Officer Liu, please let me go.

243
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,130
You're scared of them.

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,370
Aren't you scared of me?

245
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,730
You're a policeman.

246
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,420
You wouldn't kill me, right?

247
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,940
You really have no shame.

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
I like the way

249
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,370
you were earlier.

250
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,650
What did you say?

251
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,300
Come on,

252
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,540

253
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,020

254
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,210

255
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,580
Officer Liu,

256
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,380
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,220
Say it again!

258
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,580
Stand up!

259
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,540
Say what?

260
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,140
Say,

261
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,170
"A policeman carries the flag."

262
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,410
What's next?

263
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,410
A policeman carries the flag.

264
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,790
Does everyone in Shanhai Gang

265
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,750
want to be the lackeys

266
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,340
for the westerners like Liu Zhendong?

267
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,340
A policeman carries the flag.

268
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,930
Does everyone in Shanhai Gang...

269
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,500
Is that your tone?

270
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,450
Say it like you did today.

271
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,780
A policeman carries the flag.

272
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,160
Does everyone in Shanhai Gang

273
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,310
want to be the lackeys

274
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,130
for the westerners like Liu Zhendong?

275
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,340
Then I pointed a gun at you.

276
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,060
Officer Liu,

277
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,850
I'm impressed.

278
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,420
Shoot me!

279
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,660
Right here!

280
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,310
And the gesture.

281
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,250
Gesture!

282
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,790
Gesture.

283
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,720
Shoot me!

284
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,750
Right here!

285
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,580
Yes.

286
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,720
Keep doing it.

287
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,590
Keep doing it!

288
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,610
You're carrying the flag.

289
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,310
You're a disgrace

290
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,650
to Lion City!

291
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,860
Okay.

292
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,210
Since Shanhai Gang

293
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,650
no longer has a leader.

294
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,820
Then dissolve it!

295
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,480
From now on,

296
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,610
Shanding Gang will be
in charge of this area!

297
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,380
Go ahead.

298
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,900
Shoot me!

299
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,780
Shoot me, tough guy!

300
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,970
Officer Liu!

301
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,530
I've told you.

302
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,170
You're a policeman.

303
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,210
You wouldn't kill me.

304
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,010

Let me handle this.

308
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,130
Tie a rock, throw him into the sea,

309
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,170
and he'll disappear for good.

310
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,180
No.

311
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,170
Throw him out on the street.

312
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
