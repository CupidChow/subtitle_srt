00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,170
Please,

4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,730
I really can't tell you.

5
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,210
Please don't kill me.

6
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,790
I can do anything

7
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,960
for you.

8
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm begging you.

9
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,780
Oh my god.

10
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,220
Hurry up!

11
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,540
- Move! Move!
- Step back!

12
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,420
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

13
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,460
I made you take a risk for me.

14
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,900
Don't ever

15
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,140
say that again.

16
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,540
Let's go.

(Shanhai Is Our Home)

18
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,060
Mom,

19
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,780
it's all my fault.

20
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,100
I didn't listen to you.

21
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,340
I nearly got Mr. Liu killed.

22
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,860
Why are you crying?

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
You,

24
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,060
lift your head up.

25
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,100
You're brave.

26
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,340
You're looking more like your dad.

27
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,340
Still laughing?

28
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,340
It's not Mr. Liu's fault.

29
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,140
It's all on me.

30
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,700
You keep calling him

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,660
Mr. Liu.

32
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,270
Doesn't that sound awkward?

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,660
From now on, call him

34
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,420
Zhendong like I do.

35
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,260
A man doesn't say

36
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,140
he loves you all the time,

37
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,980
but his action

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,340
proves everything.

39
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,670
He's willing to risk his life for you.

40
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,990
You can rely on him.

Gang Leader Cheng Hui

44
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,820
has been framed!

(Hero of Loyalty and Righteousness)

46
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,020
I told you Cheng Hui

47
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,220
is innocent.

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,820
Didn't Cheng Nanping

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,140
cut ties with her father?

50
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,020
Looks like Cheng Hui

51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,580
is innocent.

Breaking news!

53
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,820
This newspaper

54
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,500
is actually praising a gang leader.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,860
This is outrageous!

56
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,380
I've seen it.

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,660
Did you see

58
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,900
the reporter's name?

59
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,820
Cheng Nanping?

60
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,700
She always signed as Nanping before.

61
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,700
Now she's added her

62
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,660
surname.

63
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,180
A Cheng.

64
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,860
Cheng Hui's daughter.

65
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,740
Her father's is going to die,

66
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,220
and she's just writing
a tribute for him.

67
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,580
Don't be so nervous.

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,760
Our proposal

69
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,140
for a public hearing

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,780
has been approved.

71
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,220
I want

72
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,420
to hold it

73
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,380
right on Shanhai Street.

74
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,820
Shanhai Street?

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
That alley is narrow.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,780
The only open spot

77
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,660
is at Shanhai Gang's entrance.

78
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,660
That's the place.

79
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,860
You Chinese people have a saying,

80
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
something like...

81
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,660
To not only take one's life
but to crush their spirit and soul?

82
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,740
Yes.

83
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
That's it.

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,940
Officer Zheng, you're so ruthless.

85
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,300
Judge the killer

86
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,700
Cheng Hui at that place,

87
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,420
what a brilliant idea.

88
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,820
After that,

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,220
Shanhai Gang

90
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,260
will be the joke of the city.

91
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,420
Every citizen will despise them.

92
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
It's a great suggestion.

93
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,140
To crack down on

94
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
these gangs,

95
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,700
we have to pick

96
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,500
the most symbolic spot.

97
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,540
So, Agent Liu,

98
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,220
you're on board with our plan?

99
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,180
Of course.

100
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,260
Chief James,

101
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,260
what do you think?

102
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,220
I'm an outsider here.

103
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,940
If you two locals

104
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,900
both agree,

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,220
I'll also agree.

106
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,540
Alright, it's settled then.

107
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,180
Okay, it's a deal.

108
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,660
My friend,

109
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,620
don't blame yourself.

110
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,220
Liu Zhendong is still alive,

111
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,940
but it might be a good thing.

112
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,660
He's still useful.

113
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,460
Some things are interesting.

114
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
Liu Zhendong

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,420
was born on Shanhai Street.

116
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,740
If he judges Cheng Hui,

117
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,700
it could be

118
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,340
the final blow

119
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,060
for Shanhai Gang.

120
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,620
But I hate his look.

121
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,060
Feels like he wants to be above all.

122
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,660
No worries.

123
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,540
After Cheng Hui's public trial,

124
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,260
he could end up dead on the street.

125
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,300
People from Shanhai Gang

126
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,180
won't forgive his betrayal.

127
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Other gangs

128
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,970
might also kill him

129
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,220
to get back at Shanhai Gang.

130
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,220
Let's just wait for good news.

131
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,380
You cunning fox.

132
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
I'm suddenly in a better mood.

133
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,860
Time to eat.

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,700
Boss,

135
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,500
there's a new newspaper.

136
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,060
Nanping has published

137
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,140
three reports in a row.

138
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,820
(Cheng Nanping)
With these reports,

139
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,020
the citizens

140
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,380
won't be blinded.

141
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,140
It won't be easy for them to frame you

142
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,780
with false charges.

143
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,020
Zhao,

144
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,220
when can we get out of here?

145
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,180
We're not

146
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,860
involved in murder cases.

147
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,900
We can leave anytime.

148
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,020
We only need a lawyer for bail.

149
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,860
I'm asking about Boss.

150
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,100
He'll have a public trial

151
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,340
in three days.

152
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,660
With what charges?

153
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,860
Killing Huang Jinhu.

154
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,900
The court

155
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,580
will be set up outside Shanhai Gang.

156
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,220
(Zhongxin Restaurant)

157
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,500
Xu Guangrong,

158
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,740
what are you doing here?

159
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,060
Master Cheng sent me.

160
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,580
Cheng Hui.

161
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,620
Stop using him to scare me.

162
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,300
He's in jail.

163
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,780
He killed my father.

164
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm going to Shanhai Gang

165
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,620
and testify to get him punished.

166
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,080
Take one pill every

167
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,170
- Nanping.
- morning and night.

168
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,940
- I asked the doctor.
- No need for noon.

169
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,740
You shouldn't go.

170
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,700
No.

171
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,020
I have to be there.

172
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,980
Someone's setting him up.

173
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,020
Exactly.

174
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,060
That's right.

175
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,860
We're counting on you.

176
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,900
Don't worry.

177
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,260
After today,

178
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,820
Shanhai Gang

179
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,099
won't be a threat anymore.

180
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,860
Quiet!

181
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,980
Quiet!

182
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,580
Court is now in session.

183
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,820
Everyone, please stand.

184
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Your Honor,

185
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,620
before the trial begins,

186
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,060
may I say a few words?

187
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,780
Your Honor, before the trial begins,

188
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,060
may I say a few words?

189
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,580
Ladies and gentlemen,

190
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,900
I'm Liu Zhendong,

191
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,100
an anti-crime agent in Lion City.

192
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,460
We're holding this trial

193
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,980
to let everyone

194
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,940
witness

195
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,100
the Lion City government's

196
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
resolve to fight crime.

197
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,740
Of course,

198
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,860
when we talk about criminal groups,

199
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,460
we don't just mean gangs,

200
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,860
but also

201
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,740
corrupt cops

202
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,740
and civil servants who break the law.

203
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,140
- That's it.
- Isn't that Zhendong?

204
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,620
That's Liu Xiongwu's son.

205
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,180
Looks like Shanhai Gang lost support.

206
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,980
How could Master Cheng
be sentenced to death?

207
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,460
Hope he can be alright.

208
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,980
Now we begin
the public trial of Cheng Hui

209
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,660
of the murder of Huang Jinhu.

210
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,420
Bring in the defendant, Cheng Hui.

211
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,260
Master Cheng.

212
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,220
He's here.

213
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,820
- Master Cheng!
- Boss!

214
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,780
Master Cheng!

215
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,100
Master Cheng!

216
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,060
- Boss!
- Boss!

217
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,660
- Master Cheng!
- Ping.

218
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,460
Dad.

219
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,100
How's your injury?

220
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,060
I'm fine.

221
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,220
I know you didn't kill him.

222
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,060
I saw the article

223
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
you wrote.

224
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,180
It's good.

225
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,860
Zheng Qiu must've framed you.

226
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
All these years,

227
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,300
he never gave up.

228
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,660
Do not surrender.

229
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,580
Don't worry.

230
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,380
A Shanhai Man

231
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,860
never surrenders.

232
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,420
- Boss.
- Boss.

233
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,380
Boss.

234
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,000
Cheng Hui,

235
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,940
male,

236
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,820
61 years old.

237
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,680
- Is that you?
- Yes.

238
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,660
Do you have a defense attorney?

239
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,220
Your Honor.

240
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm representing myself.

241
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,060
Regarding the police's accusation

242
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,580
of murdering Huang Jinhu

243
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,260
and disposing of his body,

244
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,900
the evidence and confession are here.

245
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,940
Please have a look.

246
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,860
Do you have

247
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,460
any objections to the evidence

248
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,780
and your confession?

249
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,020
Yes, Your Honor.

250
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,260
Let me make this clear.

251
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,260
If the court finds me guilty,

252
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,300
I'll take full responsibility.

253
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,500
It has nothing to do with Shanhai Gang.

254
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,980
Shanhai Gang started in Lion City,

255
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,900
and it's been here for 30 years.

256
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,780
The word "gang"

257
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,900
stands for helping each other,

258
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,820
instead of committing crimes.

259
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,460
We're hardworking

260
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,660
and never lazy.

261
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,780
We stick together

262
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,490
and help each other out.

263
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,340
We're also brave

264
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,970
and never back down.

265
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,540
That's how Shanhai Gang used to be.

266
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,870
I believe our future generations

267
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,240
will be the same!

268
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,820
- Well said!
- Well said!

269
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,780
Great!

270
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,630
Objection.

271
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,640
This is

272
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,730
irrelevant to the case.

273
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,830
Objection sustained.

274
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,020
Defendant, please

275
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,390
stick to the case.

276
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,540
Yes, I admit

277
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,530
I took Huang Jinhu

278
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,020
from the hospital

279
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,180
because he was my brother.

280
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,500
I thought he wasn't safe.

281
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,300
I did it to save him.

282
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,540
As for the other charges,

283
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,510
they're all false.

284
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm Zhou Fulai,

285
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,160
the prosecutor.

286
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,430
The person next to me

287
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,200
is the chief inspector
of the Lion City Police,

288
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,220
Zheng Qiu.

289
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,880
He knows the case very well

290
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,120
and will help us with the trial.

291
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,140
Cheng Hui,

292
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,380
you already signed

293
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,900
your confession.

294
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,740
Why are you denying it?

295
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,140
Sir,

296
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,220
I'm already 60 years old.

297
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,900
I feared being hurt,

298
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,460
so during the interrogation,

299
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,220
whatever you wanted me to say,

300
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,380
I just said it.

301
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,020
You made me sign it.

302
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,820
Did I have any choice?

303
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,060
It turns out

304
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,420
even Master Cheng was bullied by them!

305
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,220
Look at his injuries!

306
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,580
They must've hurt him!

307
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,420
Yes!

308
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,500
How could they treat
Master Cheng like that?

309
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,220
Quiet!

310
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,660
Your Honor,

311
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
we've known

312
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,900
each other for decades.

313
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,620
He's been known as a cunning fox.

314
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,980
Changing his story

315
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,820
didn't surprise me at all.

316
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,180
Please call

317
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,380
the witness,

318
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,620
Huang Zhongxin.

319
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,820
Zhongxin?

320
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,740
Isn't he Master Cheng's godson?

321
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,580
Yes.

322
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,580
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

323
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,460
Wasn't he his godson?

324
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,320
How's he a witness now?

325
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,180
Your Honor,

326
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,700
most people

327
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,820
on Shanhai Street know

328
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,260
Huang Zhongxin is Cheng Hui's godson.

329
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
But at the same time,

330
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,460
he's also

331
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,740
the victim's son.

332
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,740
Cheng Hui killed Huang Jinhu,

333
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
and Huang Zhongxin saw everything.

334
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,420
Call the witness.

335
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Turns out Huang Zhongxin

336
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,940
is Huang Jinhu's son.

337
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
- What's going on?
- Yes.

338
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,260
Didn't he die in an explosion?

339
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,180
What's really happening?

340
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,460
How did Cheng Hui kill him again?

341
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,740
Then his words should be reliable.

342
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,700
Yes.

343
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,980
Where is he?

344
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,340
- Exactly.
- Yes.

345
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,260
He didn't show up.

346
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,420
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

347
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,270
Why isn't he here yet?

348
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,730
- Where is he?
- What's happening?

349
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,620
What's going on?

350
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,630
Where's the witness?

351
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,060
What is going on?

352
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,240
- Why hasn't he come?
- This...

353
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
Where's the witness?

354
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,540
It's been so long.

355
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,420
Your Honor,

356
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,420
Shanhai Gang is the biggest

357
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,940
gang in the city.

358
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,980
They've used violence

359
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,220
to expand its turf

360
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,820
and its influence,

361
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,300
collected protection fees,

362
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,700
run illegal casinos,

363
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,220
smuggled drugs, kidnapped people,

364
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,740
hurt women,
and committed countless crimes.

365
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,380
The witness Huang Zhongxin

366
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,380
is absent today.

367
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,820
Maybe the gang has taken action.

368
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,180
I'm afraid

369
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,500
his personal safety

370
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,700
is threatened.

371
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,180
That said,

372
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,660
please rest assured.

373
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,020
The police

374
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,180
will do everything we can

375
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,740
to keep the witness safe.

376
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,380
The Shanhai Gang's casino

377
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,180
was shut down four years ago.

378
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,260
You claim they're smuggling,

379
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,420
kidnapping,

380
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,460
and hurting women.

381
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,700
Do you have any proof?

382
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,460
- Yes!
- Is there any proof?

383
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,780
- Got proof?
- Show us the evidence.

384
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,500
Quiet! Silence!

385
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,460
Your Honor.

386
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,300
Ms. Cheng Nanping

387
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,580
is Cheng Hui's daughter.

388
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,700
She should be

389
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,180
expelled from the court.

390
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,020
Objection.

391
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,700
This is a public trial.

392
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,660
Everyone has the right to attend.

393
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,060
Ms. Nanping,

394
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,060
please don't disrupt the court.

395
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,100
Objection sustained.

396
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,860
Please continue.

397
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,940
During earlier interrogation,

398
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,060
Cheng Hui admitted to the murder

399
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,300
and disposing of the body to the sea.

400
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,180
This is exactly what Shanhai Gang

401
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,260
has always been doing.

402
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,260
Anyone who betrays the leader

403
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,180
ends up getting punished like this.

404
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Such cruel acts

405
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,740
clearly show

406
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,460
the true nature of Shanhai Gang.

407
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,860
Criminals like them

408
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,820
are exactly what the government

409
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,500
is trying to wipe out for good.

410
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,100
Regarding the actual murder

411
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,420
and the body disposal,
the police have any other witnesses?

412
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,380
Yes.

413
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,180
Officer Wang A'hui

414
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,260
and Cheng Minghao

415
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,940
witnessed

416
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,980
Cheng Hui's

417
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,540
disposing of the body,

418
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,340
but they couldn't stop him.

419
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,660
We're working hard to find the body,

420
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,100
but we haven't found it.

421
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,940
That's their testimony.

422
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,100
Your Honor.

423
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,580
The testimony is clear.

424
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,740
Defendant Cheng Hui,

425
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,780
do you have any objections
to the testimonies

426
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,020
of the two officers?

427
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,900
All that is slandering.

428
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I didn't kill him

429
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,940
or dispose his body.

430
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,900
Yes!

431
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,780
- Slandering!
- All made up!

432
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,460
Show us the evidence!

433
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,140
We need evidence!

434
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,220
- Quiet!
- Your Honor.

435
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,980
As a notorious

436
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,940
gang leader,

437
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,060
Cheng Hui

438
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,740
is cunning and sly.

439
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
He refuses to confess.

440
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,740
This shows the government's

441
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
crackdown on gangs

442
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,300
is going to be tough.

443
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,180
But we are confident.

444
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
We can wipe them out

445
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
for good.

446
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,460
I believe

447
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,420
the jury

448
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,060
will judge Cheng Hui's crimes

449
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,300
fair and impartial.

450
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,540
Your Honor,

451
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,100
