3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,060
Hello, Zhendong.

4
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,430
Tell us what you need.

5
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,060
Hongxing Gang is always here for you.

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,620
Thanks, bro.

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,590
- Zhendong.
- Hello.

8
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,620
Let's grab a drink next time.

9
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,590
Heqing Hall's brothers

10
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,530
all respect you.

11
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,690
That's right.

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,780
Thanks, bro.

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,470
Zhendong,

14
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,530
we're at your service.

15
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,020
Thank you.

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,590
- Great!
- Great!

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,430
Uncle Heihu,

18
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,370
what's going on?

19
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,250
Gangsters aren't fools.

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Everyone knows

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,900
how Steven died.

22
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,800
Uncle Heihu!

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,290
Amazing!

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,220
Master Cheng,

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,340
are you looking for me?

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,780
Little Tail?

27
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,840
(Little Tail)

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,900
How did you end up like this?

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,180
You didn't go to school?

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,340
That's not right.

31
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,660
Before I went to Xiangfu,

32
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,780
I arranged someone for you.

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,220
They should give you money every month

34
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,240
for your life and education.

35
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,800
Didn't they give you money?

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,740
They did.

37
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,630
Leader Xiongwu

38
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,100
gave me money every month.

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,940
Why didn't you go to school?

40
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,300
What did you do with it?

41
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,370
I sent it home.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,100
Sent it home?

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,040
My mom has a lot of kids.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,190
I've got two brothers

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,130
and sisters.

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,730
If I didn't send money home,

47
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,290
they'd starve to death.

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,490
Master Cheng, let me join your gang.

49
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,460
I can run errands

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,070
and deliver messages

51
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,140
for you.

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,260
You brat.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,740
Let's go.

54
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,010
Close your eyes.

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,270
What's so funny?

56
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,210
Boss,

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,560
you cut my hair,

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,660
and I'll scrub your back.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,060
Can you do that?

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,810
Come on.

61
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,220
Leader Xiongwu was a good man.

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,260
However, some people tried to kill him.

63
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,160
Poisoning didn't work,
so they hired a killer.

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,170
This is outrageous.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,250
Wait.

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,500
What poisoning?

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,970
You don't know?

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,390
Right here. He came here

69
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,800
(Ho Kong Cng Clinic)
after giving me

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,740
money.

71
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,600
I asked him if he was sick,

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,540
and he said...

73
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,290
Someone wants to kill me.

74
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,490
I was poisoned.

75
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,660
But Dr. Xu has figured it out.

76
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,460
He's trying to cure me.

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
Who'd dare do that?

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,850
You're the leader. You could crush them.

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,290
So far,

80
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,100
I haven't figured it out.

81
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,820
However,

82
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,530
as long as I'm alive,

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,820
the person

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,490
will pay for it.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,140
Knock on the door.

86
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,780
(Ho Kong Cng Clinic)

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,740
Who?

88
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,180
(Xu Guangrong, Doctor)

89
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,460
Are you Master Cheng?

90
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,010
Come in.

91
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,700
(Xu Guangrong Clinic)

92
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,420
Dr. Xu,

93
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,340
have we met before?

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,780
We're old acquaintances.

95
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,130
Old acquaintances?

96
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,830
Why can't I remember

97
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,900
where we met?

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,100
Give me a hint.

99
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,820
My father also ran a clinic.

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,660
30 years ago,

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,340
you won a match

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,730
but hurt your feet.

103
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,210
You came for treatment.

104
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,580
Back then, our clinic

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,660
had a nurse

106
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,500
named

107
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,620
Shuzhen.

108
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,430
Now I remember.

109
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,370
That's right.

110
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,340
Shuzhen once told me

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,070
your whole family

112
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,140
treated her well.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,870
It was you who gave her the medicine

114
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,820
and bandages

115
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,680
for my wounds, right?

116
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,700
Back then, I was just a kid.

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,740
Actually,

118
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,930
I even went to

119
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,580
your wedding.

120
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,800
Really?

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,170
But it was so crowded that day.

122
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,660
You don't remember me.

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,100
But I remember

124
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,430
Shuzhen told me

125
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,630
that you studied abroad

126
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,050
but didn't learn medicine.

127
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,340
I studied accounting.

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,820
But when I came back,

129
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,950
I couldn't get a job.

130
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,290
How come?

131
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,220
Foreign companies are everywhere.

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,900
You came back from overseas,

133
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,020
so you could make a fortune.

134
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,780
I don't want to cook the books for them

135
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,580
to make dirty money.

136
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,840
Now I get it.

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,620
Dr. Xu, I came here...

138
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,820
I know why you're here.

139
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,380
I've got hospital records,

140
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,660
detox prescriptions,

141
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,620
and the medical records

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,020
I wrote for Xiongwu.

143
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
(Ho Kong Cng Clinic)

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,980
So,

145
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,980
you knew I'd come.

146
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,060
Since I heard you came back

147
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,180
after Xiongwu's death,

148
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,460
I've figured

149
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,380
that you'd come sooner or later.

150
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,460
So,

151
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,420
I've prepared everything.

152
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,260
Hope this can help you.

153
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,140
We have to find the person

154
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,220
who poisoned him.

155
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,860
This person was up to no good,

156
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,580
not only using slow-acting poison

157
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,780
but trying to mess with Xiongwu's mind.

158
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,060
I think

159
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,620
their real goal

160
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,220
is to bring down Shanhai Gang.

161
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,860
I pay for your food and clothes,

162
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,900
and you've always got that face!

163
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,180
Do I owe you anything?

164
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,260
You deserve this!

165
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,500
I...

166
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,460
I'll beat you to death!

167
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,620
Behave yourself!

168
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
You nasty woman!

169
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,140
This is my home!

170
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,980
How dare you stop me

171
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,820
from coming home?

172
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,820
My Lady,

173
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,380
it's time to sleep.

174
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,620
It's the 1st day of the 7th month.

175
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,020
I'll guard his tablet tonight.

176
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,060
After how he treated you,

177
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,140
you still...

178
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,780
Once married, two people
will always care about each other.

179
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,140
My concerns for him, however,

180
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,300
were gone long ago.

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,980
I'm guarding his tablet

182
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,620
because I hope

183
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,620
he can move on

184
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,540
and rest in peace.

185
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,660
I hope he doesn't bother Zhendong.

186
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,740
Nanping?

187
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,100
It's late. It's dangerous for you

188
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
to walk on the street alone.

189
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,420
The most dangerous person in Lion City

190
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,980
is standing right in front of me.

191
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,420
And you pretend to care about me?

192
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,300
I admit

193
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm a dangerous person.

194
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,340
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

195
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,900
I've been following you.

196
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,820
You've been wandering around.

197
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,620
Do you have nowhere to go?

198
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,220
Or is it

199
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,940
not time for killing yet?

200
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,340
This isn't your first time, is it?

201
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,180
Before Steven's death,

202
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,860
you'd killed Wu A'nan from Shanding Gang.

203
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,100
How many lives have you taken?

204
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,580
Let's put that aside.

205
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,380
You've been following me.

206
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,740
You must be tired.

207
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Late-night snacks?

208
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,180
Eat with a serial killer?

209
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,780
Interesting.

210
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,540
I want to eat frog congee.

211
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,140
Let's go.

212
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,020
Eat while it's hot.

213
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,260
You're three years older than me.

214
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,660
That's right.

215
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,660
You weren't tall when you were a kid.

216
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,300
Other kids often bullied you.

217
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
I don't remember.

218
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,580
When I left Lion City,

219
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,540
you were ten.

220
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,100
You chased me for three blocks,

221
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,700
holding a giant bag of candy

222
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,460
and the cake your mom made.

223
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,020
Did I really do that?

224
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,260
You're a good kid.

225
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,620
Kid?

226
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,060
No matter what,

227
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,180
I'm older than you.

228
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,780
You should call me big brother.

229
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,900
It's inappropriate

230
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,140
to call me a kid,

231
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,260
right?

232
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,940
When did you learn to kill?

233
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,020
Did he teach you that?

234
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,140
Eat it while it's hot.

235
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,660
Did he tell you to kill Steven?

236
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,140
Who are you

237
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,740
referring to?

238
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,460
Cheng Hui.

239
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,460
You're Second Uncle's son,

240
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,420
the Shanhai orphan he talks about.

241
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,900
But he used you to kill someone.

242
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,100
He got hurt that day.

243
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,780
I felt so bad for him,

244
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,900
so I spent the whole night

245
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
writing articles
in both Chinese and English.

246
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,620
That's exactly what he needed.

247
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,020
I need the news.

248
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,220
The bigger the impact,

249
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,180
the safer I am.

250
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,300
However, they used the buzz

251
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,500
to rally people against the government.

252
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,660
And you

253
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,220
openly killed Steven

254
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,300
and became the hero of the gang.

255
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,020
Nanping,

256
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,020
how could you think that way?

257
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,040
I saw them

258
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,900
all look up to you like a hero.

259
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
Isn't that the truth?

260
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,060
Cheng Hui wanted to come back,

261
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,980
so he told Uncle Fa to take the blame.

262
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,340
You killed Steven,

263
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,580
and Qi took the fall for you.

264
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,900
You two are really alike.

265
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,100
Is this your so-called

266
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,140
loyalty?

267
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,380
You're well-educated,

268
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,260
yet you trust him so easily

269
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,940
and even became his weapon.

270
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,900
Enough!

271
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,220
Don't talk about him like that.

272
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,940
Your dad

273
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,500
is a real hero.

274
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,300
He never orders anyone.

275
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,700
Everything Uncle Fa did

276
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,220
was his own choice.

277
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,660
Yes.

278
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,940
I admit I killed Steven.

279
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
But no one told me to.

280
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,500
I'd never let Qi take the blame.

281
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,460
You know nothing

282
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,060
about our loyalty.

283
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,860
And you don't need to.

284
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,340
I remember,

285
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,900
your dad

286
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,140
sent you away

287
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,300
when you were little.

288
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,740
He did it for you.

289
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,620
He wanted to protect you.

290
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,660
Now listen,

291
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,140
leave here right now.

292
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,540
Besides, my mom

293
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,620
shouldn't stay either.

294
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,740
You two should go together.

295
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,620
Grandpa has a house in Malacca.

296
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,220
You can stay there.

297
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,980
Who are you to tell me what to do?

298
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,460
I'm a reporter.

299
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,940
I have the right to know the truth.

300
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,220
And I should tell my readers

301
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,020
the truth through the news.

302
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,180
You openly killed a senior official.

303
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,540
You're criminals!

304
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,300
Don't worry.

305
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
I'll use my words

306
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,300
to expose you

307
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
and isolate you

308
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,060
from the people in Lion City.

309
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,100
Nanping,

310
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,060
have the books you read

311
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,380
turned your brain to mush?

312
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Why can't you tell

313
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,580
right from wrong?

314
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,540
As a killer,

315
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,140
you're telling me about right and wrong?

316
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,420
Ridiculous.

317
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,380
Do you want to eat or not?

318
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,020
If not, I'm leaving.

319
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,340
Run! Run!

320
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,780
Run!

321
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,260
Boss.

322
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,420
Catch them!

323
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,820
Don't worry, I'm here.

324
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,900
Stop!

325
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,860
Run!

326
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Stop!

327
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,380
Stop!

328
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,740
This way!

329
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,860
Where are they?

330
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,350
Let's split up.

331
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,380
Zhendong!

332
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,500
Be careful.

333
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,340
Liu Zhendong!

334
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,780
Hand over

335
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
Cheng Hui's daughter,

336
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,780
and I'll let you go!

337
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,260
You killed Steven,

338
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,380
and I respect you for that.

339
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,180
But don't go too far!

340
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,580
The debt must be paid!

341
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,300
You have nothing to do with this!

342
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,180
Search!

343
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,180
Zhendong!

344
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,140
Watch out!

345
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,020
Don't shoot! The police will handle it!

346
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,740
Zhendong!

347
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,420
Zhendong!

348
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,860
(Chatsworth Hospital)

349
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,780
Boss.

350
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,700
Zhendong had a surgery,

351
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,660
and the bullet is out.

352
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,210
But he's still unconscious.

353
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,980
The doctor doesn't know
if he'll wake up.

354
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,940
We found the person.

355
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,140
It was Qiu Xinghua,

356
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,090
Peng's man.

357
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,370
The patient is still in a coma.

358
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,290
No visitors.

359
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,160
Just me alone.

360
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,360
I only want to see him.

361
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
Zhendong.

362
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,260
Zhendong?

363
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,980
Dad...

364
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,020
I'm Uncle.

365
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,620
Nanping didn't get hurt.

366
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,260
I know.

367
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,140
It's all her fault.

368
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,460
She shouldn't have
wandered around at night.

369
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,820
Don't blame her.

370
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,980
She...

371
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,740
She's adorable.

372
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,940
Can I call you Dad

373
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,820
just like her?

374
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,260
Zhendong,

375
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,780
call me whatever you want.

376
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,540
Dad.

377
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,740
I've told you

378
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,700
no to go out at night,

379
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,180
especially not with Zhendong.

380
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,020
Do you know how many enemies he has?

381
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,300
It's so dangerous.

382
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,100
I was the reason he was in danger.

383
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,740
That person wanted to kill me.

384
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,140
Alright, it's my fault.

385
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,580
If I hadn't been caught up by

386
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,180
Fengyun Hall's business, none of this

387
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,140
would have happened.

388
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,860
I heard you even pulled the trigger.

389
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,180
Did it hurt your hand?

390
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,260
- Dad.
- Nanping, come with me.

391
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,740
A few days ago,

392
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,260
I asked you to leave Lion City,

393
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,140
and you wouldn't.

394
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,820
I asked Zhongxin to visit you every day

395
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,060
just to remind you

396
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,420
that Lion City isn't safe.

397
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,540
But you wouldn't listen.

398
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,860
I've told you many times

399
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
that you shouldn't walk alone at night.

400
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,860
It's dangerous.

401
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,500
You still ignored my words.

402
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,700
Look what happened.

403
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,780
Zhendong is your second uncle's

404
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
only son.

405
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,420
If anything happens to him,

406
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,140
how will I face my sworn brother

407
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,900
after I die?

408
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,860
Zhendong is Second Uncle's only son,

409
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,860
yet you made him a killer.

410
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,810
I know Elder Liuliu's death

411
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,220
affected Shanhai Gang's reputation.

412
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,860
So you ordered Zhendong

413
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
to kill Steven.

414
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,020
Did you think about the consequences?

415
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,060
If Qi hadn't taken the blame,

416
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,980
Zhendong would've been executed by now.

417
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,100
