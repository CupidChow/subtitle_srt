3
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,260
Zheng Qiu?

4
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,220
Yes.

5
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,460
So,

6
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,420
this time,

7
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,860
we must get the police

8
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,020
to agree to trial, whatever it takes.

9
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,860
Once the killer rats out Zheng Qiu,

10
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,860
we'll use the westerners

11
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,020
to get rid of him.

12
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,380
Only in this way

13
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,740
will Shanhai Gang finally have peace.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,900
Liuliu,

15
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,820
you are

16
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,060
older than me,

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,900
but you've always called me Boss.

18
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,260
(Solemn)
I should've avenged you right away.

19
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,260
However, hundreds of brothers

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,340
followed us into the martial world

21
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,300
and became our family.

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,500
Now that Xiongwu and you are gone,

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,820
I can't leave them behind.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,540
They all

25
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,580
have families to feed.

26
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,700
You're right.

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,500
Right now,

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,980
Shanhai Gang

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,580
needs peace more than anything.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,020
Don't worry, Liuliu.

31
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,220
I will avenge you and Xiongwu.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,460
Just give me a little more time.

33
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,260
When we meet again,

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,860
I'll drink three bowls of wine...

36
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,100
(to make it up to you.)

37
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,020
Thank you.

38
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,380
Zhongxin.

39
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,340
Here.

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,780
Have a seat.

41
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,700
I ordered this for you.

42
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,140
You're so kind today.

43
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,900
You even bought me coffee.

44
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,380
I've bought you a lot of coffee
since childhood.

45
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,220
Brat,

46
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,860
you never treated me

47
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,700
except when you were bullied

48
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,820
and needed my help.

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,020
Zhongxin,

50
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,060
don't insult me in person.

51
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,180
It was harsh.

52
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,500
Can't you talk nicely?

53
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,120
Congratulations,

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,990
Hall Leader Liu.

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,340
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,700
I'm not the hall leader.

57
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,180
In a few days,

58
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,420
I'll leave for France.

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,460
What?

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,500
France?

61
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,140
Listen,

62
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,340
Shanhai Gang really needs people now.

63
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,140
If you bail,

64
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,300
I'll beat you up!

65
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,140
Look at you, always so fierce.

66
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,380
Just because you're older than me,

67
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,340
you're always bullying me.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Stop joking.

69
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,140
Answer me.

70
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,260
Shanhai Gang

71
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,300
needs talents.

72
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,660
Do you agree?

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,590
Yes.

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
But not

75
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,900
a loser like me.

76
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,580
You called yourself a loser.

77
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,980
You're not that bad.

78
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,860
You've got some real skills.

79
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,540
And you deserve to be

80
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,500
the hall leader.

81
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,100
Now that Dad has chosen you,

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
just do your job well.

83
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,620
Don't let him down.

84
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,900
If you talk about

85
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,860
going abroad again,

86
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,780
I won't go easy on you.

87
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,100
Uncle.

88
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,980
I brought you breakfast

89
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,260
and coffee.

90
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,500
Flat rice noodles, pork intestine soup,
rice noodle rolls,

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,460
fried dough sticks,

92
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,820
and coffee,

93
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,380
that's a lot of food.

94
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,740
Come on, let's eat together.

95
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,140
We already ate.

96
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,340
I had coffee with Zhongxin

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,340
this morning.

98
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,140
So, you have something to say to me?

99
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,460
Not me.

100
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,580
He dragged me along.

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,540
I do.

102
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,980
Sit down.

103
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,500
Go ahead.

104
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,980
Uncle.

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,780
I know that Shanhai Gang

106
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,980
needs talents.

107
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,580
So, I recommend

108
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,940
Zhongxin as the leader of Fengyun Hall.

109
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,300
But your uncles all think

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,660
you're more suitable.

111
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,180
I'm not.

112
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,380
Zhongxin

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,220
has been by your side,

114
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,700
fighting for Shanhai Gang,

115
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,100
while I was studying overseas.

116
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,180
And I used to be a cop,

117
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,860
which makes me

118
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,980
even less suited.

119
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,420
I was set up before

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,860
and almost lost my life.

121
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,140
If you and Zhongxin

122
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,660
hadn't risked your lives to rescue me,

123
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,580
I would've been

124
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,900
in a coffin by now.

125
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,500
Uncle,

126
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,020
I know you want to

127
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,060
cultivate the young ones.

128
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,180
Zhongxin is the best choice!

129
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,100
- Zhendong...
- Zhongxin,

130
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,060
you're our gang's orphan.

131
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,900
When you were ten,

132
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,820
Uncle Huang Jinhu

133
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,260
died for the gang.

134
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,180
You taught him to be

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,300
brave and smart.

136
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,540
Among the younger folks,

137
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,120
he is way more respected than me.

138
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,380
Zhendong,

139
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,220
do you mean it?

140
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,970
Of course.

141
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,220
Then I'll be honest with you.

142
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,790
I also want

143
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,730
to choose Zhongxin.

144
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,440
Seeing you two

145
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,500
defend each other

146
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,260
makes me truly happy.

147
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,940
Zhongxin,

148
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,180
it's settled then.

149
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,020
You will be the next

150
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,420
leader of Fengyun Hall.

151
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,720
Zhongxin.

152
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,900
Congratulations!

153
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,300
(1 Million Hotel)

154
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Miss!

155
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,260
Need a ride?

156
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,100
A rickshaw?

157
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,020
So old-fashioned.

158
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,890
I can pull faster

159
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,820
than a pedicab.

160
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,380
You won't be disappointed.

161
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,260
Who'd believe that?

162
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,220
Liar.

163
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,340
I'm serious, miss.

164
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,500
Trust me and

165
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
let me give you a ride.

166
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,940
It's free.

167
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,580
Why?

168
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,900
Well, because...

169
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,940
you're beautiful.

170
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,500
I've never seen

171
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,290
such a beautiful lady in Lion City.

172
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,620
Alright then.

173
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,900
I'll give you a chance.

174
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,620
Okay.

175
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,060
Come on.

176
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,140
I think I've

177
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,890
seen you before.

178
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,340
Maybe I just

179
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,350
look average.

180
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,450
Hurry up, I'm in a rush.

181
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,410
Got it.

182
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,380
Such a beautiful place, isn't it? See?

183
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,060
Yeah, it's really a beautiful place.

184
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,740
I've been there yesterday.

185
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,420
(Longxing Rickshaw)

186
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,380
It was pretty fast.

187
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,100
How much?

188
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,380
It's really free.

189
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,700
Seriously?

190
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,220
Use this to wipe your sweat.

191
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,500
Lady, please.

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,780
It smells so good.

193
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,940
Sir, please.

194
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,220
Sorry, sir.

195
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,500
Upstairs isn't open right now.

196
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Why?

197
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,900
But that lady just went up.

198
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,980
Here's the thing.

199
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,580
A guest booked out the bar.

200
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,180
That lady is his friend.

201
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,700
I'm a friend too.

202
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,060
Sorry, you really can't go upstairs.

203
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
We only serve

204
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
registered guests.

205
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,940
Well, is that guest

206
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,180
so powerful that no one

207
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,900
dares to offend him?

208
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,420
Actually, I just want some coffee.

209
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,700
Where can I get it?

210
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,360
Coffee, right this way.

211
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,220
This way.

212
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,780
Sir,

213
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,220
your coffee.

214
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,620
Thanks.

215
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,940
The coffee is good.

216
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,420
I'll come again tomorrow.

217
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,140
Okay.

218
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,180
Thank you, come back anytime.

219
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,700
Sir, your coffee.

220
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,120
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

221
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,420
Wait a second.

222
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,260
Is there anything else you need?

223
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,220
Nothing.

224
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,540
Today's coffee is amazing.

225
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,140
Alright, thank you.

226
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,980
Can you handle it?

227
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,980
Yes.

228
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,940
Measure my body.

229
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,900
Okay.

230
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,020
With your build and look,

231
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,420
it's a shame you're in this job.

232
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,460
Watch your language.

233
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,260
Do I look

234
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,380
a lot worse than him?

235
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,260
You're also handsome.

236
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,980
You work for the westerners, right?

237
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,940
What did you say?

238
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,300
Well, I made a mistake again.

239
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,500
This building has seven floors.

240
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
The five floors

241
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,140
in the middle are the offices.

242
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,580
Besides the cafe on the first floor

243
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,780
where they serve guests,

244
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,820
there's only the bar on the top floor.

245
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,500
So this must be the bar

246
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,180
(Bar)
that Steven has booked out.

247
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,620
And this bar

248
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,740
is connected to the rooftop.

249
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,540
You can enjoy the city view

250
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,820
while drinking.

251
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,100
There's a suite attached.

252
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,940
He can go to sleep after drinking.

253
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,220
How do you know?

254
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,660
The woman in cheongsam

255
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,620
told me that.

256
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,100
That westerner

257
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,940
didn't come back last night.

258
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
He probably got drunk

259
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,900
and slept with someone else.

260
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,660
Are you going to

261
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,620
catch him in the act?

262
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,900
Alone?

263
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,860
He might hurt you.

264
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,330
Catch?

265
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,720
For what?

266
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,940
He snores so loudly.

267
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,900
Besides me,

268
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,180
who can put up with it?

269
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,380
They'd leave right away.

270
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,980
Who would stay the night with him?

271
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,460
Well,

272
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,700
I just want to see

273
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,020
if someone

274
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,820
gave him money last night.

275
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,500
I can pick it up

276
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,660
before he wakes up.

277
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,900
You really get people talking.

278
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
You should work for Fengyun

279
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,420
as a secret agent.

280
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,300
Gentlemen,

281
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,700
welcome to the Lion City.

282
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,820
Cheers.

283
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,500
This is the most stunning piece

284
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,260
I've ever seen.

285
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,140
It's perfect for Ms. Lin.

286
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,460
Lion City is

287
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,780
a very prosperous place to be.

288
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,020
So, all the business in the Lion City,
you know what I'm saying?

289
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,900
Well, look, I can help you.

290
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,260
But, the question here is,

291
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,180
what's the percentage of my partnership?

292
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,180
20 percent of profit.

293
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,380
20 percent of profit.

294
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,340
Look at that.

295
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,860
That's so beautiful.

296
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Yeah.

297
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,300
No 20 percent of profit!

298
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,420
It's 40 percent of profit!

299
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,100
You know what it costs
to do business here?

300
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,500
Don't play coy with me!

301
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,260
Darling.

302
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,300
Keep your voice down, okay?

303
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,060
Look, you scared them.

304
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,180
Sorry, darling.

305
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,180
I was so rude.

306
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm going to the bathroom.

307
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,700
See you later.

308
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,260
- See you.
- See you.

309
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Stop!

310
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,620
For the beautiful ladies,

311
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,380
30 percent,
that's my final offer, 30 percent.

312
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,900
Yeah.

313
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,100
30 percent it is.

314
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,900
- Deal.
- 30 percent.

315
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,340
Waiter!

316
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,180
Whisky, come on!

317
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,340
Sir.

318
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,020
Do I know you?

319
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,300
Absolutely.

320
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,900
I'm your grandpa.

321
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,060
Liu Zhendong?

322
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,340
What the hell?

323
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,220
What are you doing?

324
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,420
Silence.

325
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,860
Steven!

326
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,500
Be quiet!

327
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,940
Steven...

328
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,660
Run!

329
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,620
Run!

330
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

331
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,540
calm down and listen to me carefully.

332
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,380
Well,

333
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,340
welcome to the Lion City for business.

334
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,300
To ensure your safety,

335
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,420
I suggest you

336
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,300
remember what happened tonight.

337
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,340
As you know,

338
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,740
friends are coming from far away.

339
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,900
Steven is so happy.

340
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,300
Because of that, he drank a lot.

341
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,380
He got drunk,

342
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,300
and he slipped
and fell from the building.

343
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,940
What a shame.

344
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,700
Understand?

345
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,460
Understand?

346
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,020
Yes!

347
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,340
Steven got drunk

348
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,300
and slipped himself.

349
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,260
Keep that in mind.

350
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,700
Okay.

351
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,660
Okay.

352
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,460
Let's go.

353
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,620
Thanks, Officer Gou.

354
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,260
Thank you, sir.

355
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,900
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

356
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,100
Okay.

357
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,500
- Dong.
- What's wrong?

358
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,820
He's dead.

359
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,540
We're all happy about it.

360
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,820
Someone thinks

361
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,140
it was you.

362
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,380
How's that possible?

363
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,700
I used to be a cop.

364
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,380
I always abide by the law.

365
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,100
Nice!

366
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,740
Goodbye, Dong.

367
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,940
Young Master.

368
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,020
I just asked Officer Gou.

369
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,900
Those four westerners cooperated.

370
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,780
They repeated the story I told them.

371
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,100
That's great.

372
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,500
Let's eat.

373
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,020
The woman in cheongsam ran away.

374
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,500
The police will find her soon.

375
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,420
Besides, she recognized you.

376
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,900
Qi.

377
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,140
You know what to do,

378
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,100
right?

379
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,940
Who's there?

380
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,620
Oh, it's you.

381
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,460
Be quiet.

382
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,380
What are you going to do?

383
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,740
I...

384
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,100
I...

385
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,380
You're shaking.

386
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,620
What took you so long?

387
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,580
What did you do to her?

388
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,260
Just scare her

389
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,620
and make her leave, that's all.

390
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,780
You didn't kill her, did you?

391
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,180
No.

392
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,620
But she took me down.

393
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,860
Great.

394
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,020
I want to marry her.

395
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,580
You...

396
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,020
Qi,

397
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,740
love affairs

398
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,100
might get you killed!

399
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Ask her to leave

400
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Lion City immediately.

401
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,940
You should also leave.

402
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,860
Don't come back

403
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,820
until things calm down.

404
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,300
