One.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,070
Exactly 45 seconds.

9
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,150
We can eat now.

10
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,120
You need to crack the egg

11
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
at the perfect time
to get the best taste.

12
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,590
I taught you that.

13
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,860
Yes.

14
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,840
You taught me

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,910
a lot of good stuff.

16
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,630
I used to

17
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,190
see you as my

18
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,750
best friend.

19
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,800
I don't deserve it.

20
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,750
You're not wrong.

21
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,400
Back then,

22
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,030
I knew little about

23
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,870
friendship.

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,470
Actually,

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,870
I just thought you'd be

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,630
useful to me.

27
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,000
I wanted to use

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
you,

29
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,560
a smart laborer,

30
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,360
to make a name for myself

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,430
and solve my problems.

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,080
However,

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,400
I didn't expect

34
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,520
you'd become a threat.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,890
Lion City's coffee is really special.

36
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,960
No wonder so many people come

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
and never want to leave.

38
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,910
You're now ruling the city,

39
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,240
of course you'd stay.

40
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,750
Ruling the city?

41
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,190
I've never thought of that.

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,750
All I want is to survive

43
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,840
and to let my brothers

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,800
have a chance to survive

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,750
and rise.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,960
You made it.

47
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,190
The foreign masters

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,800
gave me clear orders

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,150
to let you survive

50
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,430
and rise.

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,120
But I'm curious.

52
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,000
How much money did you spend?

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,120
Was it all from

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,190
your so-called brothers' hard work?

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,750
Are they all really willing

56
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,840
to let you call the shots?

57
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,360
The kaya toast here

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
is also pretty good.

59
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,960
When I was in Xiangfu,

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,390
I really missed the taste.

61
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,240
You keep dodging my questions.

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,960
Sir,

63
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,040
I invited you for dim sum

64
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,160
because I wanted to make peace

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
and be your friend.

66
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,070
After all, Shanhai Gang's business

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,430
and development

68
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,070
still need your support.

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
You were the reason my dad died.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,430
Now you expect me

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,630
to be your friend?

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Then what did you do to my family?

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
Do you have proof?

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,840
Fine,

75
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,480
I can stop searching for evidence.

76
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,360
Lately, I've realized something.

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,070
You have to

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,190
know when to move on.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,510
You can't have it all.

80
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,600
Everyone will die

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,630
eventually.

82
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,510
Sir,

83
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,160
if you're willing to let it go,

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,200
I can do the same.

85
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,520
As for the old grudges,

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,720
I can forget about them.

87
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,630
But if you want to keep fighting,

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,430
then I won't back down either.

89
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,270
The coffee here

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,750
is really authentic.

91
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Sir, the 3rd day

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
of next month,

93
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,480
our fleet will have an opening ceremony.

94
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,920
I'd like to invite you.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll send a flower basket.

96
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,630
Then I'll thank you in advance.

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,820
Thank you, guys.

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,400
I...

99
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,720
Don't tell me you made this.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,840
I don't buy it.

101
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,720
I really did.

102
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,950
Your cooking has improved a lot.

103
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,000
I love seeing you smile.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,560
- Boss.
- Boss.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Hall Leader Huang.

106
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,630
Please come back to Fengyun Hall.

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,750
We need to talk to you.

108
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,030
I don't think so.

109
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
Boss,

110
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,000
I've heard some rumors.

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
They say...

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,720
It's not a rumor.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,320
It's true.

114
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,870
Go back and wait for the new leader.

115
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,050
I, Fei.

116
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,950
I, Deng.

117
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,790
I, Tang.

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,120
In this life,

119
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
we'll only be loyal to you.

120
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,320
Thank you, guys.

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
- But...
- But even with rumors,

122
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,120
there was never a clear order.

123
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,230
So, you're still the hall leader.

124
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,000
Exactly. How can Shanhai Gang

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,390
find someone like you?

126
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,270
At this point,

127
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,310
if you lead us

128
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,150
and make a difference,

129
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,600
you'll definitely

130
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,870
get that seat back.

131
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,150
Yes, Boss.

132
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,190
We've been planning this for so long.

133
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,510
We've been waiting for you to return

134
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,390
and lead us.

135
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,000
Bin Langxiong is already gone.

136
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,920
Qiankun Society has no leader now.

137
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
It's a perfect chance

138
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,270
to take over

139
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,010
their territory.

140
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,510
Brothers from Fengyun Hall!

141
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,350
Yes!

142
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,790
Follow me!

143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Yes!

144
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,240
Place your bets!

145
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,390
Big, big, big!

146
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,680
- Nobody move!
- Don't move!

147
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,390
Don't move!

148
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,820
Don't move!

149
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,120
The guests are innocent.

150
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,390
Keep playing.

151
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,550
Don't move!

152
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,390
What are you doing?

153
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,790
What are you doing?

154
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,770
Don't move!

155
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,870
Come on!

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Keep playing.

157
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,920
What are you doing?

158
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,030
What are you doing?

159
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,880
What's going on?

160
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,760
What are you doing?

161
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,760
Don't move!

162
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,150
Is your warehouse

163
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,590
profitable?

164
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,360
Just admit it.

165
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,720
Losing money is not shameful.

166
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,670
Now that you can't make ends meet,

167
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,360
you must make changes.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,840
Go see for yourselves.

169
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,030
Shanhai Gang's warehouse

170
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,910
is way faster than yours

171
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,120
when loading and unloading goods.

172
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,510
Our boss wants to help you.

173
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,150
You should be grateful,

174
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,150
or you'll regret it.

175
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,720
You think you can win
with the rusty iron?

176
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,310
Do you want to reunite with

177
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,250
Bin Langxiong?

178
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,200
Put it down!

179
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,750
You two.

180
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,200
Uniforms are not your weapons.

181
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,510
Be polite.

182
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,590
Yes, Boss.

183
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,630
Okay.

184
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,710
You...

185
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,680
Have a problem?

186
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,250
Come on.

187
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,960
Pick a weapon.

188
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,270
Let's fight.

189
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,770
Hall Leader Huang,

190
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,200
we're by the sea.

191
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
It's windy.

192
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,340
Put it on.

193
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,840
It's fine.

194
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,150
My abs also need

195
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,140
some air.

196
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,380
(Fengyun Hall)

197
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,630
So,

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
are we still Qiankun Society?

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,280
Sure.

200
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,780
Let's call it Fengyun Qiankun Society,

201
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,620
a combination of our names.

202
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,720
It's good.

203
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,630
What's wrong?

204
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,920
You don't look happy.

205
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
After all, Qiankun Society

206
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,000
is a decades-old gang.

207
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,790
Even if we join Shanhai Gang,

208
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,360
at least we should be equal

209
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,590
to Fengyun Hall!

210
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,300
Shanhai Gang has four halls,

211
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,960
Fengyun, Xiayi,

212
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Zhongxiao,

213
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
and Weiyuan.

214
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,910
Which one do you want to replace?

215
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,800
Listen,

216
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,720
as a gangster,

217
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,360
Bin Langxiong

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,670
broke the rules.

219
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,070
He colluded with the police

220
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,570
to kidnap and kill people.

221
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,560
What's that?

222
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,740
He had it coming.

223
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,880
If I hadn't helped you,

224
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,690
the police would've shut you down.

225
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,390
Fine.

226
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,910
If you want to be outcasts,

227
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,990
you can reject

228
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
the tea.

229
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
I won't drink it!

230
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Don't move!

231
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
Quite a scene here.

232
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,080
Sorry,

233
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,270
I'm late.

234
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
Hall Leader Huang,

235
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,710
sorry for this.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,840
I was

237
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,550
talking to Master Cheng

238
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,510
and lost track of time.

239
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,710
Sorry to keep you waiting.

240
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,780
Have a seat.

241
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,720
Heaven and earth are vast,
and mountains and seas are benevolent.

242
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,720
We're all just trying to make a living

243
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,810
in Lion City.

244
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,340
We're friends.

245
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,000
Master Cheng has something to do

246
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
and can't come here.

247
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,020
Sorry about that.

248
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,230
Uncle Zhao...

249
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,190
Master Cheng

250
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,770
asked me to deliver a message.

251
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,190
Today, let's have tea

252
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,190
and make friends.

253
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,040
Next time,

254
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,780
we'll host you at the headquarters

255
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,970
and have a discussion.

256
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,840
I wonder

257
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,680
if you can accept this.

258
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
That sounds good.

259
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,790
Master Cheng

260
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,760
is always so thoughtful.

261
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,610
Thanks.

262
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,350
Alright.

263
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,970
Pour me some tea.

264
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,600
Today, I'll toast with tea

265
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,030
to the three of you.

266
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,750
Hall Leader Huang.

267
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
You too.

268
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,200
Come on.

269
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,100
(Shanhai Is Our Home)

270
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
Master Cheng.

271
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,120
Zhongxin didn't do it wrong.

272
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,080
Qiankun Society holds some power

273
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
and big territory.

274
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,030
Although their business is limited,

275
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
it's better than nothing.

276
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,340
Now's the perfect time

277
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
to take it.

278
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,140
Plus, Fengyun Hall

279
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,070
took it over

280
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,630
without bloodshed.

281
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,570
What's wrong with that?

282
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,360
You have a point.

283
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,550
However, if you'd

284
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,600
told Boss about it in advance,

285
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,960
wouldn't it be better?

286
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,150
Since we're here to discuss,

287
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,570
let's all share our thoughts.

288
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,480
Honestly, I didn't expect

289
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,790
Zhongxin would act so fast.

290
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,380
With such decisive moves,

291
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,840
no wonder he was trained by you.

292
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,890
Yes.

293
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,060
He's brave

294
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,960
and smart.

295
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,440
Plus, there's no gang fight

296
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,630
or anything out of control.

297
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,480
He might be reckless,

298
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,030
but I don't think

299
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,960
he needs to be punished.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,360
Of course, it's up to you.

301
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,110
Zhao.

302
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,870
Well,

303
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,240
I agree with them.

304
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,240
Is that all?

305
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,840
At a time like this,

306
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
if we want to

307
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
take over Qiankun Society,

308
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,700
we need real courage.

309
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,780
To take it without bloodshed,

310
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,900
we need a solid plan.

311
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
Young as Zhongxin is,

312
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,840
he did it pretty well.

313
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,720
I truly respect that.

314
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Boss,

315
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm speaking from the heart.

316
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,920
If you don't like

317
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,440
what I said,

318
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,960
you can scold me.

319
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,320
- Anything else?
- Yes.

320
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,360
Go on.

321
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,360
He did a good job,

322
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,750
but...

323
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,390
Qiankun Society is too big.

324
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,240
It's one of

325
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,870
the four biggest gangs

326
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,390
in Lion City.

327
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,580
If we stuck to Zhongxin's plan

328
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,810
and took it,

329
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,490
tomorrow's headline

330
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,720
would be that

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,750
Shanhai Gang swallows Qiankun Society

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,920
and becomes the biggest gang
in Southeast Asia.

333
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,440
Wouldn't that be great?

334
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,930
We've worked hard most of our lives

335
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,630
just for this day.

336
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,120
The tallest tree catches the wind.

337
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,840
Rong,

338
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,200
you're an educated man.

339
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,800
You should understand.

340
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,090
Boss

341
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,910
already had his eye on Qiankun Society.

342
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,350
That's why

343
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,510
he didn't comfort Nanping.

344
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,980
He played golf with Charles instead.

345
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,700
You probably don't know this.

346
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,500
That day,

347
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,080
after we left the cabin,

348
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,860
half of Lion City's police officers

349
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,740
rushed to the scene.

350
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,820
Besides An Gexiong,

351
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,240
there were twelve of his men

352
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,630
and a police officer's body.

353
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,670
Charles offered to help,

354
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,150
saying he'd clear our name.

355
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,800
As for closing the case,

356
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,000
they had no conclusion.

357
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,480
If we took over

358
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,500
Qiankun Society now,

359
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,920
wouldn't that

360
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,350
bring trouble to us?

361
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,110
Zhongxin,

362
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,750
come over here.

363
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,560
Dad.

364
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,970
Did you hear

365
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,820
what Zhao said?

366
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,150
I heard it.

367
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,810
You acted without our permission.

368
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,880
How should you be punished?

369
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,630
Boss.

370
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,270
Zhongxin's always been obedient.

371
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,750
For the sake of his loyalty

372
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,510
to our gang and you,

373
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,940
please spare him this time.

374
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,880
You call that obedient?

375
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,680
I told him to leave Fengyun Hall,

376
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,800
but he didn't listen.

377
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
I told him to leave the Shanhai Gang,

378
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,160
he still ignored it.

379
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,480
Is he obedient?

380
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,590
Boss!

381
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,820
When Huang Jinhu, his father,

382
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,110
came here from overseas,

383
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,440
he was an infant.

384
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,550
Back home, he nearly starved to death.

385
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,790
When he turned eight,

386
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,250
a kind neighbor

387
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,350
brought him here.

388
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,110
They finally reunited.

389
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,880
But less than two years later,

390
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Huang Jinhu

391
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,490
died for the gang.

392
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,790
In that explosion, his body

393
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,810
was all torn apart.

394
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,080
At that time, Zhongxin

395
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
was just ten years old.

396
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,240
You once said

397
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,690
we'd take care of

398
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,070
the Shanhai orphan forever.

399
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,070
He grew up

400
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,510
in Shanhai Gang.

401
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,250
How can he bear

402
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,460
to leave the gang?

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Rong,

404
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,440
it's in the past.

405
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,480
He won't even listen to me now,

406
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,730
and you call that loyalty?

407
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,410
You want blind loyalty, right?

408
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,900
Why not just get yourself a dog?

409
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,110
- Rong!
- Shut up!

410
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,030
Zhongxin's still young.

411
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,590
He's not as scheming as you.

412
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,550
You can ask Charles

413
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,400
for intel.

414
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,790
But he doesn't know

415
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,680
any foreign officers.

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,920
He just wanted

417
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,550
to expand our territory

418
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,270
and make us stronger.

419
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,400
Was he wrong?

420
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,160
Here's

421
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,350
my word.

422
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,640
You can't expel Zhongxin

423
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,680
just for a minor

424
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,920
mistake.

425
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,200
You can't dismiss his position

426
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
either!

427
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,310
Good thing he isn't a teacher.

428
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,980
Otherwise, the kids

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,780
would be scared

430
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,660
out of their minds.

431
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,640
No idea what got into

432
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,590
Rong today.

433
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,440
Boss,

434
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,350
don't be angry.

435
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,320
Yes, Boss.

436
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,010
He was definitely off today.

437
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,070
That was a really

438
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,910
good speech.

439
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
We should all

440
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,220
speak our minds.

441
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,800
Boss,

442
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,350
don't take it to heart.

443
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,890
Zhongxin,

444
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,200
look,

445
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,880
they all spoke up for you.

446
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,980
Shanhai Gang won't kick you out.

447
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,500
But you can't go back

448
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,690
to Fengyun Hall.

449
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,100
(Shanhai Rickshaw Fleet)

450
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,800
Go to the hospital.
