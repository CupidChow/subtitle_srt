(hit the lowest point

give up and)

13
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,220
(got through
it anyway.)

(they
contributed a lot,)

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,660

suffered a lot.)

(Hexing Bakery)
Get some pastry!

39
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,080
Try some of
this pastry!

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,120
Ours is the best!

41
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,440
Pastry!

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
It's just the
thing for a snack!

43
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,360
You're 17 now?

44
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,320
I've waited for
this moment

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,120
for years.

46
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,470
Get away from me!

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,390
Come on!

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,760
Go away!

49
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,070
Stop!

50
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,320
How is your
daughter now?

51
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,230
She doesn't eat.

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,000
She's overwhelmed.

53
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,590
She's ruined.

54
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,620
But she is so young.

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,190
What should I do?

56
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,320
Didn't you
call the police?

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,290
This happened before.

58
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,740
We called them.

59
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,450
But they did nothing.

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,520
Why?

61
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,270
That thug does

62
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,200
business with
westerners.

63
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,680
They get along well.

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,030
The police can't
do anything to him.

65
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,440
So I came to
ask for your help.

66
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,880
(United as One)
It's said

67
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,250
that only Shanhai Gang

68
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,640
helps the poor in Lion City.

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,020
(United as One)

70
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,440
Master, I've
checked it out.

71
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,410
(United as One)
Is it true?

72
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,520
Yes.

73
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,550
Where is he?

74
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,900
2 men from Fengyun Hall

75
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,840
are with him.

76
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,390
He really can

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,150
drink a lot.

78
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,640
Let him do
whatever he wants.

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,790
Officer Stevens
and I were on the 2nd

80
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,710
(Garson & CO.)
floor of Laifushi City Hotel.

81
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,080
A westerner
owns the bar.

82
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,120
Many girls there are

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,910
hauntingly beautiful.

84
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,590
You know
some westerners.

85
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,320
That's awesome.

86
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,610
Would you

87
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,080
help me get promoted?

88
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,710
Sure. Sure.

89
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,810
Stevens gave me a cigar

90
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,780
at that time.

91
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,200
(Shanhai)
I lit it. It tastes stinky.

92
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,100
(Shanhai)

93
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,380
(Shanhai)

94
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,040
Uh.

95
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,150
Master,
I didn't take it.

96
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,350
You don't have
to do this yourself.

97
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,980
Master. Come on! Stop!

98
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,100
Qi and I can
handle this.

99
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,040
Let go of me!

100
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,520
I'll kill him myself!

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,840
The girl he hurt.

102
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,150
I knew her when

103
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,910
she was little.

104
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,960
She sold pastry and

105
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,120
made a living
in Gongxi Street.

106
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,230
She is nice.

107
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,760
She just turned 17.

108
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,720
Let's go.

109
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,600
Fa.

110
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,200
My doctor
is pretty good.

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,080
Ask him to
treat the girl.

112
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,200
Pay him as much

113
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,420
money as he wants.

114
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes, Master.

(Xingzhou Daily)

117
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,180
You did this?

118
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,680
The missing
businessman's

119
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,060
body was found
at the sea.

120
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,300
(Liu Zhendong, Lion City PD)
The police is on it.

121
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,590
Keep going.

122
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,760
Try some.

123
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,370
Tell me!

124
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,560
Did you kill him?

125
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,400
What the hell!

126
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,010
You saw that?

127
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,220
He hit me!

128
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,160
I...

129
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,400
What are you doing?

130
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,710
You're under arrest.

131
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,200
Are you crazy?
I'm your dad.

132
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,340
Zhendong.

133
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,590
Come on.
It's not funny.

134
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,820
Master.

135
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,760
It's your fault.

136
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,390
He is a police
officer now.

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,280
You can't
just hit him.

138
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,700
I was wrong?

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,640
Yes!

140
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,040
Okay then.

141
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,430
I'm sorry,

142
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,800
sir.

143
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,580
Zhendong.

144
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,710
Take these back.

145
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,960
People will talk about this.

146
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,670
Okay.

(Morality)

148
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,120
Son. Here.

149
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Son. Have some.

150
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,160
I know where
you get this.

151
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,960
You helped
kill the man.

152
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,430
She gave you

153
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,520
this as a gift.

154
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,680
I didn't want
to take this.

155
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,490
But the girl came

156
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,250
here every day.

157
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,440
She wouldn't leave.

158
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,560
She suffered a lot.

159
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,870
I can't just
turn her away.

160
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,490
Fa took this.

161
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,400
Yes.

162
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,310
Yes.

163
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,320
I think he did
the right thing.

164
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,650
It's delicious.

165
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,830
Try some.

166
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,960
You admitted it?

167
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,760
What?

168
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,960
That girl did
give this.

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,320
What did I say?

170
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,320
- Fa.
- Nothing.

171
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm warning you,

172
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,710
don't you ever
do this again.

173
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,120
Or

174
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,680
I'd put you in prison.

175
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,400
Son.

176
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,520
Liu Zhendong!

177
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,350
(Morality)
Your uncle just wanted you

178
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,830
to get some
experiences.

179
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,590
Stop acting like this.

180
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,560
Come back to
Shanhai Gang.

181
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,920
Or I'll

182
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,510
kick you out
of this family.

183
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,460

184
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,340
Don't you dare!

185
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,120
You heard that?

186
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,630
I'm your father!

187
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,180
He...

188
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,320
Everything is fine.

189
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,760
You said that.

190
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,120
What did he do?

191
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,670
He got mad!

192
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,990
He won't leave you.

193
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,420
(Pengxing)

194
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,460
(3 months later)

195
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,340
(Enjoy the Meal)
Here.

196
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,280
Here. Cheers.

197
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,710
Cheers.

198
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,830
Mr. Yang, you're here!

199
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,320
Have fun!

200
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,320
Officer Liu!

201
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,560
There are
some new girls!

202
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,160
Take a look.

203
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,760
Come here!

204
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,070
Hurry up!

205
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,440
What do

206
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,490
you think?

207
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,430
Did anyone force

208
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,830
you to do this?

209
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,510
- No.
- No.

210
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,370
You're an officer now.

211
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,490
You're much hotter.

212
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,370
Your dad asked

213
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,940
the same question!

214
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,410
I'm telling you,

215
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,750
behave yourself.

216
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,790
Or you'll be arrested.

217
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,830
If you force

218
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,720
innocent girls
to do this,

219
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,920
Shanhai Gang
will punish you.

220
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,880
I got it.

221
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,400
Fill this out first.

222
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,520
Guys!

223
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,200
Coffee time!

224
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,610
- Okay.
- Thanks. Thanks.

225
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,060
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

226
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,280
Thanks. Thanks.

227
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,650
Here.

228
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,590
Thanks.

229
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,700
You're welcome.

230
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,640
It's mine.

231
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,950
You're welcome.

232
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,160
Coffee.

233
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,430
Officer Liu.

234
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,870
There is
only one left.

235
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,960
I've had coffee.

236
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,180
These are

237
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,400
all for your guys.

238
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,410
(Gou Wentong, Lion City PD)

239
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,350
Thanks, Officer Liu.

240
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,590
Master!

241
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,710
I...

242
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,580
- Come with me.
- Are you done?

243
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,770
- Okay.
- Okay. You can leave now.

244
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,010
I've told you
many times,

245
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,200
don't call me master!

246
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,310
And you

247
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,470
called me that here.

248
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,450
Master,
something happened.

249
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,400
What?

250
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,280
Your dad is dead.

251
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,350
What?

252
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,040
Qi.

253
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,350
Stop joking

254
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,620
about this.

255
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,080
It's not funny.

256
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,590
In a warehouse,

257
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,200
someone stabbed him.

258
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,280
Back off! Back off!

259
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,140
Leave here!

260
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,040
Back off!

261
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,010
What's going on?

262
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,850
Back off! Back off!

263
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,800
Don't come any closer!

264
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,890
Zhendong. Zhendong.

265
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,830
Zhendong.

266
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,040
Calm down.

267
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,070
Calm down.

268
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,020
(Qingmai, Xiangfu)

269
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,800
Sir, hurry up!

270
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,200
- Coming! Coming!
- Sir, hurry up!

271
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,250
Coming!

272
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,200
- Coming! Coming!
- Coming!

273
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,970
- Here.
- Cheers.

274
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,830
Here you go.

275
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,610
This is yours.

276
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,230
Here you go.

277
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

278
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,510
Thanks. Thanks.

279
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,160
- Move!
- Move!

280
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,470
Let's go.

281
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,350
- Let's go.
- Let's leave.

282
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,240
Old man.

283
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,800
Today is the last day.

284
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,680
Give us the money.

285
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,960
With all due respect,

286
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,400
you've got my money.

287
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,750
You gave it to Kun?

288
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,240
Yes.

289
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,530
I killed Kun.

290
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,820
It doesn't count.

291
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,280
Now I'm the boss here!

292
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,230
Okay then. Okay.

293
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,200
I went to make

294
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,770
some dishes
for you.

295
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,470
Please wait a second.

296
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,110
I don't
want your food.

297
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,860
Old man.

298
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,110
Stop it.

299
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,880
Come on.

300
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,870
Give us the money.

301
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,070
Sorry. Sorry.

302
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,510
I'm new here.
I didn't know.

303
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,560
They killed Kun.

304
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,980
Guys! Kill them!

305
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,180
Hey! Hey!

306
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,120
Stop!

307
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,440
Don't do this!

308
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,920
No!

309
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,640
Stop!

310
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,320
Calm down!

311
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,680
Hey. Hey.

312
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,830
Hey. Listen to me.

313
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,850
Guys! Go!

314
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,310
Master Cheng!

315
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,520
Master Cheng!

316
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,710
Master Cheng!

317
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,110
A letter from Lion City!

318
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,920
Something happened!

319
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,070
Lion City?

320
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,350
Master Cheng?

321
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,390
Is

322
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,480
he Cheng Hui?

323
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,920
(To Cheng Hui, bad news)
Cheng Hui? Sure?

324
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,920
(Cheng Hui, Shanhai Ex-Leader)
He's cruel.

325
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,720
Master Cheng.

326
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm so sorry.

327
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,940
(Huang Zhongxin, Godson of Cheng Hui)
How dare you!

328
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,550
Come on.

329
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,740
Sorry!

330
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,750
Sorry, Master Cheng!

331
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,030
Sorry! Please spare us!

332
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,500
- Master Cheng.
- Spare us.

333
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,440
- Spare us.
- Spare us.

334
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,970
- Spare us.
- Get lost!

335
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,340
- Spare us.
- Let's go!

336
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,750
Let's go!

337
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,410
- Zhongxin.
- Yes.

338
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,510
Book tickets.

339
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,040
Okay.

340
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:45,580
(Lion City)

341
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,900
(Tribute)

342
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,440
Officer Liu,
sorry for you loss.

343
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,870
Why are you here?

344
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,550
You don't work today?

345
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,030
I find it strange, too.

346
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,600
Today is your

347
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,760
dad's funeral.

348
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,090
We were supposed to do

349
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,500
something guard duty.

350
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,340
I got it.
You may leave.

351
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,110
Wait. Officer Liu.

352
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,120
Keep an eye on
Shanding Gang.

353
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
What do you mean?

354
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,750
I heard they'd

355
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,790
get together today.

356
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm afraid

357
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,880
they'll cause trouble.

358
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,270
I think you should

359
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,710
finish the
funeral ASAP.

360
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,550
Okay. I got it.

361
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,070
Elders.

362
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,960
It's time now.

363
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,200
We should start.

364
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,910
Zhendong.

365
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,110
You're just in time.

366
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,600
We're talking
about this.

367
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,880
Elder Liuliu is here.

368
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,260
He will host the

369
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,200
ceremony.

370
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,150
What? He can't do this?

371
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,380
(Lian Liuliu, Baishan of Shanhai Gang)
I'm

372
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,350
getting old.

373
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,990
I can't host this.

374
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,390
Hey.

375
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,520
You can't leave.

376
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,020
Everything else is

377
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,900
(Elder Zhuang, Caifu of Shanhai Gang)
We're ready.

378
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,510
But we still
don't know who

379
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,470
will head
the procession.

380
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,420
In general,

381
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,300
the eldest son

382
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,440
will do this.

383
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,550
But Xiongwu is

384
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,840
Shanhai Gang leader.

385
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,270
So we should talk

386
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,270
about it together.

387
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,270
We've been in Lion City

388
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,270
for about 30 years.

389
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,220
It's the first time

390
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,860
our leader
suffered this.

391
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,360
Traditionally,

392
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,600
(Liu Furong,
Xiayi Hall Leader)

393
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,810
the one who head it

394
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,140
will be our
next leader.

395
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,110
In my opinion,

396
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,000
it's actually

397
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,110
a tough job.

398
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,260
It's tiring.

399
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,780
The leader takes huge

400
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,720
responsibilities.

401
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,840
Fengyun Hall made the

402
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,240
most money.

403
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,480
I think

404
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,310
Peng should do it.

405
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,550
Rong.

406
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,360
We all know you
two are friends.

407
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,570
You two colluded
to grab power.

408
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,860
(Heihu, He Yaohui)
I can do it.

409
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,020
(Weiyuan Hall Leader)
I'm young.

410
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,990
You're the least qualified.

411
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,300
(Peng, Huang Youcai)
Master Liu was killed

412
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,690
(Fengyun Hall Leader)
in your area.

413
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,960
We can't find
the murderer.

414
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,550
Maybe you killed him.

415
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,110
How dare you!

416
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,480
At that day,

417
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,960
Xiongwu yelled at you.

418
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,510
Then someone
killed him after dinner.

419
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,840
Maybe you killed him.

420
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,000
How dare you!

421
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,340
You're dead!

422
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,000
- Come on!
- Don't you dare.

423
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,150
Rong,

424
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,880
you shouldn't
have said that.

425
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,570
Heihu.

426
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,780
(Sheyan, She Xingwang)
Put that

427
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,900
(Zhongxiao Hall Leader)
down!

428
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,200
Peng.

429
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,450
Take

430
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,750
your gun back.

431
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,830
Sit.

432
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,610
I think the one

433
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,030
who contributes
the most

434
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,680
will be the leader.

435
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,310
And I am

436
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,120
the most
qualified one.
